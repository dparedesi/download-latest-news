UPDATED 11:33 EST / JANUARY 25 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we team up with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s prognostication follows the publication where we grade our 2025 predictions. In this Breaking Analysis, we tap some of the most telling nuggets from ETR’s rich data set and put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025. Most of the predictions below are backed up with data based on proprietary market intelligence from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey (TSIS) and its quarterly macro drill-down data, which surveys more than 1,700 business technology leaders. Each year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and categorize them. Every year the folder gets larger. In the graphic below we show the mix of topic areas. Of course everything is artificial intelligence, but we’ve tried to isolate those that were AI-specific. As always, security is top of mind for forecasters, as you can see with 25% of the inbounds. Our predictions this year span information technology spending, AI return on investment, Nvidia Corp.’s moat, data, large language models, cloud, changes to the software-as-a-service model, security, hardware pricing and the memory shortag, and the impact of AI on jobs. Let’s dive into the detail. The first prediction is: IT budgets rise about 5% in 2026. Since COVID, organizations have dealt with sustained pressure on IT budgets as interest rates rose and uncertainty dominated. Geopolitical tensions, wars, tariffs and related shocks have kept decision-makers cautious. Against that backdrop, ETR’s quarterly macro drill-down shows IT decision makers currently expecting a 4.6% budget increase. The call at 5% is a modest step above the mean, with notable divergence in large enterprises – they remain more conservative at under 4% – while the C-suite and Asia-Pacific respondents are more optimistic. The data is moving in the right direction. The forward spending outlook has improved meaningfully versus earlier surveys, with a notable jump from the first October survey when respondents were asked for the first time about forward spend into January. In the current survey, 74% of respondents indicate they plan to increase spending, the highest level since January 2022. This suggests the optimism is not isolated to a single segment. The large-enterprise caution is a concern, however, but even within the Fortune 500, the trend is improving, rising by more than a percentage point survey-over-survey. The C-suite cut comes in above the mean at 5.2%, reinforcing that senior leadership sentiment is leaning more aggressively toward growth than the broader population. An important nuance is what this metric represents. This is IT budget data – not vendor revenue. It includes staffing and related internal costs and should not be conflated with market forecasts from firms such as IDC and Gartner forecasting vendor revenue growth. Over time, budgets are likely to evolve as the data center buildout expands access to token-based services and as organizations scale up with less headcount. Staffing is one of the largest line items in IT budgets, and AI-driven productivity and automation will influence that mix going forward. The near-term focus, however, is the 2026 budget direction of roughly 5%, reflected in the survey. The second prediction is that 2026 becomes the year enterprises start seeing AI ROI at scale. In prior years, our prediction was that ROI would remain elusive. The data is now moving in a different direction, with signs of a productivity increasing and more evidence that enterprises are beginning to operationalize AI in ways that sustain returns. The ROI story is aligning around two themes: 1) Measurement discipline and 2) Scaling outcomes. Early in the cycle, organizations were spending heavily while a large portion of the market either was not measuring ROI or had not seen any return. In November 2024, combining “not measuring ROI” with “had not seen ROI” put the total near 50%, a concerning gap between investment intensity and financial confidence. That gap is narrowing. The most important shift is that more organizations are measuring ROI. The share that is not measuring dropped from 27% to 18%, and a rise in financial-operations adoption in the ETR data signals that enterprises are putting cost controls and accountability structures around AI spending. Six to eight months ago, FinOps barely surfaced in insights panels and interviews. Now it is showing up constantly, which tracks with a market moving from experimentation to governance and operational rigor. The data also shows incremental improvement in realized ROI bands. The 1% to 10% ROI bucket has fluctuated but has steadily increased since November 2024. That supports the view that organizations are beginning to realize returns and are learning how to align AI initiatives with measurable outcomes. A key nuance is what enterprises expect ROI to be. In the ETR AI series data, 66% of respondents say AI ROI comes from cost efficiency and margin improvement. Only 23% expect ROI to come from revenue growth or new product creation. That distribution is relevant because it explains why FinOps is rising and why measurement is becoming central. If most ROI is expected to come from margin and efficiency, auditing and control of usage and spend becomes a prerequisite for declaring success. The third prediction comes out of research published earlier this month following Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at CES. The call is that Nvidia widens its lead over the broader graphics processing unit/tensor processing unit/application-specific integrated circuit pack because its cost per token advantage improves materially in 2026. A key factor is Nvidia’s CES disclosure that its latest GPU Vera Rubin is in full production and will ramp this year. The data shared at CES pointed to a rapid step-function improvement over Blackwell delivered in roughly 12 months: 5X performance, 10X throughput, and a 10X improvement in token cost. That combination of higher output and far lower unit costs is expected to drive a significant uptake in demand. The demand premise is based on Jevons Paradox – as price declines, consumption rises – and the prediction is that the cost-per-token reduction contributes to a 15X increase in demand. Against that backdrop, we expect the narrative that TPUs and ASICs are eroding Nvidia’s moat will itself erode, and the expectation is that Nvidia’s financial metrics will will reflect the magnitude of this advantage. Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio is hovering in the mid-20s – even lower than Walmart – and that multiple increases as investors internalize the sustainability of Nvidia’s position. It’s possible and even likely that some GPU designers will pivot to edge use cases or cancel programs. Looking ahead, our expectation is that Nvidia faces effectively no competition in the data center except where demand cannot be met. That unmet demand supports alternatives, but the path for competitors goes through inference and workloads at the edge. Our view is that Nvidia also performs well at the edge, with the addition of a lock-up a deal with Groq. Demand continues to outstrip supply, which means suppliers broadly sell what they can ship. The implication is that the best news for competitors is the current “rising tide” environment lifts all chip boats, and suppliers have little incentive to see that dynamic change soon. We believe data gravity increasingly benefits database platform incumbents as enterprises build AI capabilities on top of their existing ecosystems. Using Snowflake Inc. as an example, the data suggests that add-on services to a core data platform – like Cortex – become a natural extension of the underlying database. The core platform remains sticky, and that stickiness increases as customers pull adjacent workloads into the same ecosystem. In our view, this dynamic extends beyond Snowflake to other major incumbents, including Databricks Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. This chart above has two parts that reinforce the prediction. Specifically, when teams build AI applications, they tend to stay close to the database ecosystem where their data already lives – and that shows up in spending intentions. Starting on the right-hand graphic: This comes from ETR’s build-versus-buy AI series and looks only at respondents who say they are building their own AI applications. The y-axis is Paired Usage Likelihood Impact, which is a way of showing how strongly two components show up together in the same tech stack. Using Snowflake as the clearest example in this cut, the chart shows that when customers adopt Snowflake Cortex Search, they are far more likely to adopt additional Snowflake components. Specifically: In our view, this is the data gravity effect in practice. Once a customer is anchored in a Snowflake-led workflow for one element of the AI stack, the probability increases that adjacent elements – search, vector search or vector database style capabilities, and model-related components – remain inside the same ecosystem. Now move to the left-hand graphic: This is from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey and shows Snowflake Net Score (spending momentum) trends over time across three categories that relate to this prediction: Each cluster shows snapshots over five time points spanning from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026. The chart headline says it all: “Gains in Database and Analytics drives aggregate Snowflake recovery.” The data suggests a meaningful rebound in Snowflake’s core database and analytics momentum showing up in 2026, with Database/Data Warehousing notably jumping back up versus the prior quarters, and Analytics showing a similar recovery pattern. ML/AI remains elevated but comparatively steadier across the period. The bottom line is that we see a pull toward the incumbent’s database ecosystem when organizations are building their own AI applications. Snowflake is the clearest example in this dataset. When customers are using Snowflake for one layer of their stack, they are more likely to stay in the Snowflake ecosystem for adjacent capabilities including search, vector search, vector database and foundational model usage combined with other stack elements. This in our view highlights the predictive value of the ETR dataset as a leading indicator. In prior market shifts, Breaking Analysis observed survey data that flagged early movement, including the work-from-home wave and its impact on vendors such as CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., Okta Inc. and Zscaler Inc. We have seen similar leading signals in the rise of Snowflake and Databricks, periods of softening that preceded market repricing and subsequent rebounds. The data suggests the current resurgence is part of that same pattern of early signal preceding broader market recognition. The message is that platform incumbency is compounding in the sense that as enterprises build AI applications, they consolidate more of the stack around the database ecosystem they already trust, and the data suggests Snowflake is currently the clearest beneficiary of that gravity with a measurable resurgence in spending intent. We believe 2026 is the inflection year where leading model providers optimize around enterprise adoption, not just model benchmarks and consumer buzz. Our bet is that OpenAI follows Anthropic’s enterprise posture more aggressively, uses consumer scale as leverage, and exits 2026 with enterprise revenue that surpasses Anthropic’s. In parallel, we expect OpenAI to pressure Google’s search economics, and we expect Elon Musk’s Grok to pursue edge-oriented opportunities where he already has a strategic footprint. The chart above shows where model and AI platforms sit inside enterprise accounts today, using two dimensions from ETR’s TSIS. First, read the plots. Each dot is a vendor. The x-axis is Overlap %, which we use here as a proxy for pervasion and account penetration across the dataset. The y-axis is Shared Net Score, which represents spending momentum among the accounts where the vendor is present. The red dotted line at 40% is the “highly elevated momentum” threshold. The upper-right corner is the power position indicating high penetration and high momentum. That is where Microsoft and OpenAI Group PBC sit in the January 2026 survey and have for some time. Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC are clustered close together in the upper-middle portion, reflecting strong momentum and meaningful overlap. Databricks and Snowflake sit near one another as well, which fits our prior prediction on data gravity and platform pull-through. Anthropic PBC is high on the y-axis with strong momentum, sitting above the red line with notable progress since last year. Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama is well below the threshold and has fallen out of the leadership conversation in this dataset (and the market) relative to the leaders. In the lower-left are the legacy machine learning and AI players fighting for relevance on both overlap and momentum. Second, use the table on the right to anchor the scatter with exact numbers. For JAN26 Shared Net Score and Shared N, Anthropic leads at 72.5% (345), followed by Microsoft at 65.5% (795) and OpenAI at 60.7% (677). Databricks comes in at 58.8% (250). AWS and Google are tied at 58.0% with Shared N of 450 and 483, respectively. Snowflake is at 47.5% (265) and Meta Llama at 29.9% (137). Pervasion on the x-axis is the leading indicator to watch as this shifts from experimentation to enterprise standardization. OpenAI is already near 40% pervasion versus Anthropic at roughly 20%, while most other players remain in single digits. Anthropic doubled pervasion from about 10% to 20% in a year, but OpenAI’s starting position is meaningfully more entrenched inside enterprise environments. That penetration advantage is relevant to our prediction because we believe it makes the consumer volume a feature for enterprise, not a bug. OpenAI’s distribution, usage patterns and familiar interface create gravity that increasingly supports enterprise use cases and API-driven deployments. Recent data suggests that OpenAI’s API added more than $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate last month alone, which reflects enterprise-driven revenue generation and evidence the platform is moving beyond a consumer chatbot phase. In our view, once that enterprise flywheel starts spinning, it continues to gain momentum. On Google, our prediction extends beyond model performance, where Gemini has made truly impressive strides. We believe OpenAI’s recent moves around advertising are aimed at pressuring Google’s core economics. Search queries cost fractions of pennies, AI queries are far more expensive (100X), and we expect OpenAI to keep testing ways to insert itself and disrupt Google’s advertising economics. Though Microsoft’s earlier attempts to AI-ify Bing did not deliver the intended results, we believe OpenAI’s scale and positioning give it a better chance. On Grok, we expect a push to the edge. Elon had explored designing a data center GPU, then backed away from that path as Nvidia’s lead became more obvious. At the same time, Tesla Inc. already operates with an edge-oriented chip design capability built around Arm and customized neural processing units, or NPUs, for vehicles. We believe Grok strengthens that position, with continued silicon innovation focused at the edge while xAI Holdings Corp. scales data center capacity rapidly in Memphis – with a high priority position in Nvidia’s allocation queue. Longer-term, theCUBE Research work by George Gilbert and David Floyer suggests that leading LLM companies could evolve into a new breed of software delivered through application programming interfaces, making adoption easier for enterprises without deep engineering chops. We do not expect that full transformation to be obvious in 2026, but we believe it ties directly to the multiyear shift from legacy IT spend toward token generation and more AI-ified operating models. The message is that enterprise penetration and spending momentum are converging around a small set of leaders, and the data suggests OpenAI has the distribution advantage to translate consumer scale into enterprise-standard deployments, with Anthropic setting the pace on momentum, and Google and AWS clustered tightly – Google having the advantage in proprietary models — and Grok positioning for edge-driven differentiation over time. We believe Google Cloud Platform continues closing the gap on AWS and Azure in 2026, driven primarily by its prowess in AI, reinforced by a world-class data foundation, and supported by improving profitability. As shown below, while GCP still trails in enterprise penetration, the leading indicators in spending intent suggest momentum is shifting in Google’s favor, particularly inside large enterprises. Google Cloud Platform is showing sustained momentum. The starting point is growth and operating leverage. By our estimates, GCP grew roughly 40% last quarter. Alphabet discloses Google Cloud overall rather than GCP specifically, but we believe GCP is growing meaningfully faster than the consolidated cloud segment. At the same time, Google Cloud operating margins have moved into the black and are now in the mid-20s, and moving in a direction we see as increasingly encouraging for a scaled cloud business. In our opinion, those margins continue to expand as the business matures, and that translates into meaningful cash generation over time. The ETR data above reinforces the momentum. In the core spending intent datasets, GCP is the only one of the Big Three cloud providers showing year-over-year Net Score acceleration, while AWS and Azure both declined. Penetration remains lower – pervasion trails those two, particularly versus Azure – but the direction of spend intent is moving up. The spending intent improvements are not confined to smaller accounts. The increase shows up in Fortune 100, Fortune 500 and Global 2000 cohorts, which historically have been harder for Google to penetrate. We believe that shift reflects Google’s broader enterprise prowess – more credibility with the largest organizations and more proof points that GCP can run mission-critical workloads at scale. ETR’s AI series data provides more evidence to explain why this is happening now. We see rising usage across Google’s AI build stack, including Gemini and Vertex AI, with gains survey over survey. In our view, Google’s positioning as both a foundational model provider and a cloud hosting platform is becoming more integrated, and that integration is beginning to show up in customer behavior. We also believe Google’s approach has benefited from patience. The company has the capital to play a longer game. As operating margins climb toward the levels sustained by AWS over many quarters – and as Azure continues to benefit from software contribution – we expect Google to keep expanding profitability while it builds share. That is the combination that changes perception with accelerating demand plus improving margins. The message is that Google’s cloud business is entering a new phase where AI-led demand, improving enterprise traction and expanding operating margins work together, and the survey data suggests GCP is the only Big Three provider accelerating on Net Score while extending its relevance with the largest global organizations. We believe 2026 marks a transition year for software-as-a-service monetization. Seat-based pricing has been misaligned with customer value for a long time, and AI amplifies that tension by changing how work gets done and how many users need direct licenses. At the same time, SaaS vendors have deep entrenchment in enterprise process logic and trusted data, and in our view that gives them leverage to preserve and grow revenue even as seat growth moderates. The prediction is not a SaaS collapse. The prediction is that pricing evolves, with a shift toward outcome-based and AI-inclusive monetization showing up in the numbers. The graphic above is a two-parter designed to answer the question “Does AI reduce SaaS seats, and if it does, does revenue fall with it?” The top row focuses on seats. The bottom row focuses on spend offsets. Start with the top-left table: “AI Impact on Core Software Seats – NOV25 AI Product Series.” It breaks results by customer type and shows the percentage expecting more seats versus same seats versus less seats, then summarizes the net “seat offset.” The seat offset is positive for small and medium-sized businesses (+12%) and modestly positive for the total sample (+4%). It turns negative as you move upmarket to the Global 2000 (-1%), Large (-2%) and Fortune 500 (-8%). The message is that the biggest organizations are the ones most likely to see seat pressure. Now look to the top-right table: “Seat Offset Over Time.” It shows how that seat offset is trending from NOV24 to MAY25 to NOV25. The direction is consistent in that net seat impact is moving down over time, especially in larger cohorts. Global 2000 moves from +11% to +5% to -1%, and Large moves from +17% to +7% to -2%. Fortune 500 shifts from +6% to 0% to -8%. Seat growth is moderating, and in large enterprises it is flipping negative. Now move to the bottom-left table: “AI Spend Offset for Reductions in Seat Spending – NOV25 AI Product Series.” This is the follow-up question asking even if seats decline, does AI-related spend compensate? Respondents are asked whether AI spend will exceed, match, or fall short of any reduction in seat spend. In the Global 2000 row, 51% say AI spend exceeds the seat reduction, 33% say it matches, and 15% say it falls short. That pattern indicates monetization moving from seats toward AI and outcomes. Finally, bolster the conclusion with the bottom-right table: “AI Spend Net Impact Over Time.” This compresses the prior view into a single net impact metric over time. In NOV25, SMB shows 38%, Global 2000 shows 36%, and All Respondents shows 30%. Fortune 500 and Large are lower at 27% and 25% respectively, but still positive. Even in cohorts where seat offsets are negative, the net spend impact remains meaningfully positive. This is why we believe the market’s “SaaS is dead” and the “SaaS-Attack” narrative is overstated. Seat counts can be pressured while revenue grows if vendors successfully reprice around AI, usage and outcomes. We also believe the public commentary from large SaaS vendors aligns with this dynamic. Specifically, customers are asking for help operationalizing AI, and vendors are embedding AI into the products where data, metadata and business process logic already live. The message is that AI creates real headwinds for SaaS seat expansion, especially in the largest enterprises, but the spend data suggests SaaS vendors preserve and grow revenue by shifting monetization toward AI, usage and outcomes – a pricing evolution, not a SaaS collapse. We believe 2026 produces a new class of breach that most security teams are not prepared to contain — specifically, a major SaaS incident where no human credentials are stolen. Additionally, the attack vector is agentic, coordinated across multiple SaaS platforms, and executed by multiple AI agents from different vendors. The novelty is a logic hack, not a credential hack, set off by a prompt injection or agent-to-agent manipulation that redirects an agent’s behavior, spreads laterally via trusted integrations, and moves at machine speed across the digital supply chain. This prediction builds on a related warning from one of our inbounds that came from Shahar Man, CEO and co- founder of Backslash Security. In November 2025, he predicted, “A major MCP breach will define the AI coding threat model – We’ll see in 2026, the first large- scale breach originating from MCP.” What we saw with the Anthropic hack was related and supported the direction of Shahar’s prediction. We’re building on that prediction and expecting something broader. The breach we are forecasting involves one agent reprogramming another through prompt injection, then using MCP connections across SaaS platforms to jump domains – finance, HR, supply chain – potentially spanning multiple vendors and even multiple companies. In our view, agents become bridgeheads meaning once a nonhuman identity is granted access and can influence adjacent agents, the blast radius expands quickly. Some are referring to this as a polyagent breach, where the infection doesn’t just stay in one system. The security implication is disconcerting. Antivirus is blind to this class of attack because there is no traditional malware signature. Firewalls do not help because the agents are executing authorized actions within permitted domains. Phishing campaigns often take weeks or months to coordinate with humans. An agent-driven breach can propagate at machine speed, chaining together permissions and actions faster than human response loops can keep up. To defend this, organizations will need to put in things such as AI honeypot tokens to lure the bad agents, semantics that scan every agentic conversation, and much more sophisticated defense systems that most organizations won’t have in place in 2026. A credible path is identity-first controls and agent governance. Nonhuman identities require zero-trust security, full stop. They must be governed, continuously monitored and treated as untrusted by default. The risk is structural in that if one agent has access that was legitimately granted, and it can influence another agent, the effective access boundary expands beyond what the organization intended. The market is already signaling urgency. Within the CISO community, agentic AI governance, protection and security is again a top topic. Qualitative trend data suggests that identity-centric and zero-trust principles are among the top priorities, and the mandate is moving from theory to budget and operations. The vendor landscape is also shifting toward identity-centric consolidation and platform plays. The Palo Alto Networks Inc.-CyberArk Software Ltd. acquisition is a clear example of this direction. The practitioner requirement is for improved visibility, better decisioning based on data, and the ability to leverage identity intelligence as a defense mechanism. Security operations teams are already adopting agentic AI for triaging alerts and initial investigations, but the identity side is where the value becomes critical because identity is where the permissions live. This relates with a broader dynamic we track every year – tool sprawl and consolidation intent versus consolidation reality. Practitioners consistently express interest in reducing tool counts, but the data shows limited actual consolidation so far. That creates exposure. Platform vendors argue they are seeing consolidation power their business. Practitioners largely agree consolidation is desirable and also acknowledge it is not happening fast enough to reduce risk materially. The message here is that agentic systems expand the attack surface into a new domain where credentials are not stolen and malware is not planted, rather agent behavior is redirected. In our view, 2026 is the year this becomes visible in a major SaaS breach, and the organizations that are not operating identity-first, zero-trust governance for nonhuman identities are exposed to a class of risk that moves faster than their current defenses and operating models can respond. We believe hardware pricing remains elevated through 2026 and persists into 2027, driven by an ongoing memory shortage and a supply chain that is being reoriented around data center demand. High-bandwidth memory, NAND and RAM are in tight supply as data centers absorb capacity, and we expect that dynamic to keep pressure on pricing well beyond a normal cycle. In our view, this becomes a competitive differentiator for suppliers and OEMs that can secure allocation wins. Notably, buyers face a tougher refresh environment in 2026. The chart above captures two things: 1) How respondents say hardware prices have moved recently; and 2) How that pricing trend has shifted over time. Start with the distribution in the center. Respondents are asked: To what extent have vendors lowered or raised prices in the past six months compared to seven to twelve months ago? The responses are concentrated on the “raised” side. A meaningful portion of the sample reports increases in the mid-single digits and above, with a large block indicating raised by 3% to 5% as the most common outcome, followed by raised by 6% to 10% and additional cohorts seeing even larger jumps. At the high end, roughly 25% of respondents say prices rose 6% to 20% or more, which is a significant inflation indicator for hardware buyers. Now anchor that with the time series on the right. The average change in hardware pricing bottomed in late 2024 at roughly 2% to 2.5%. Since then, the average has risen by about a full percentage point, reaching 3.6% in the latest survey. The implication is that hardware price inflation is not fading as a temporary post-pandemic trend. It is re-accelerating at a time when many organizations would normally be entering a refresh cycle. We believe the supply-demand imbalance drives the continued trend, driven by AI factory demand. Vendors benefit from the current dynamic and have little incentive to rush pricing back down. Data center demand is being prioritized, and memory constraints ripple into everything from servers to storage to enterprise infrastructure to PCs. In our view, that is why terms like “AI-optimized” become mainstream marketing language, especially in PCs – memory becomes the gating factor, and vendors position optimization as product differentiation while supply remains constrained. We also believe this has second-order effects across the enterprise stack. Hardware refresh cycles influence demand for adjacent categories that ride on those refreshes, including security appliances and networking infrastructure. As pricing pressure persists, refresh timing and configuration decisions will become more constrained, with related impacts for vendors across the infrastructure and security landscape. Finally, we expect supply chain execution to be a competitive differentiator. Nvidia is likely to remain prioritized in the data center supply chain. On the PC side, it becomes a knife fight where scale and supply chain strength matter. Apple has scale. Dell is moving aggressively into consumer PCs and has a world-class supply chain. Storage vendors are already leaning into efficiency messaging, (for example, Vast Data Inc.’s flash efficiency messaging) and we expect more of that as the market stays constrained. The message is that the hardware market is entering a prolonged period where memory-driven constraints keep prices higher for longer, supply chain access becomes a competitive weapon, and buyers face a more expensive refresh cycle that reverberates across infrastructure categories well into 2027. We believe 2026 is the crossover year when AI’s impact on white-collar employment becomes visible in a way that is measurable and broadly acknowledged. The early impact is already seen in junior and entry-level roles, and this shows up in the data, first as headcount avoidance and then scaling without labor. In parallel, we expect sustained growth in blue-collar roles tied to the data center buildout – specialized trades and technical operators such as “artisan” plumbers, HVAC engineers, builders and cooling experts – where demand is already high and rising. The ETR survey data is already moving in the direction of this prediction. In July 2025, 21% of respondents said they were limiting future headcount due to AI. That figure has increased to 30% in the latest read. This trend is more pronounced in larger firms, which we see as the leading indicator. Among Global 2000 organizations, the number rises to 34%. Among Fortune 100 companies, 42% say they plan to limit future headcount because of AI. The message is that the larger the organization, the more aggressive the posture on future headcount constraints tied directly to AI. We are also seeing movement from avoidance to reduction. Strategic headcount reduction attributed to AI is rising more slowly than avoidance, but the increase from 14% to 18% in roughly half a year is material. These are not marginal shifts, and they are not based on a small or anecdotal sample. The survey represents roughly 1,800 qualified IT experts and IT decision-makers across industries, which makes the directional signal difficult to dismiss. We believe this sits inside a larger pattern that plays out in major technology transitions. Over successive waves – mainframes to PCs, then the internet, cloud, mobile, social and big data – markets tend to reward the new before the new is large enough to offset the decline in the old. That mismatch creates volatility and shifting narratives. We see it today in sector rotation and sentiment – semiconductors in favor, SaaS out of favor – and we expect those narratives to continue shifting. The sensible approach is to focus on the data, filter out headline noise and track the adoption signals that show up in spending behavior and operating model changes. In our opinion, AI is larger than prior waves because it stands on the shoulders of them all. It changes the unit economics of work, and that shows up first in constrained hiring and then in reductions as organizations learn where automation is durable. Over time, we expect labor demand to rebalance, with new job creation tied to physical infrastructure and AI-enabled industries, but 2026 is positioned to be the year where the labor displacement data becomes hard to ignore. The message is that 2026 becomes the year AI’s labor impact is visible in enterprise headcount decisions at scale, led by hiring constraints in the largest organizations and followed by rising reductions, while demand for specialized blue-collar roles expands alongside the data center buildout and the broader AI infrastructure wave. We’re beyond the first inning of this AI era, which started really in 2017 with research papers on diffusion models and transformers. The ChatGPT moment exposed AI’s potential to the masses and now we’re entering the enterprise adoption phase, which we see as the real opportunity. How you see 2026 shaping up?

A growing number of chart watchers are pointing to a long stretch of sideways trading for XRP and saying this setup has come before big rallies. According to a widely followed analyst known as CryptoBull, the current price action echoes earlier runs in the token’s history. The signal is simple: long quiet periods sometimes lead to sharp moves when buying pressure returns. That does not mean a jump is guaranteed. Markets can stay quiet for a long time, and timing is uncertain. Based on reports, XRP’s weekly structure shows a stretch of range trading after strong breakouts from earlier years. The comparison reaches back several cycles. In past examples, long ranges eventually gave way to impulsive runs that pushed the price far above prior highs. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 CryptoBull argues the present consolidation has lasted longer than previous ones, which, he says, could compress price action and build fuel for a larger expansion when momentum flips. The idea rests on history repeating itself in broad strokes, not in exact moves. Some analysts see a sixfold move as plausible if the same pattern plays out. That kind of rise would put XRP near $11, a figure being discussed by multiple commentators. There is also talk of a further, final wave lifting the token much higher in a later stage — talk that reaches $70 in extreme scenarios. A bottom test—where price revisits support to confirm strength before a new push—has appeared in a few past cycles and is being watched closely now. The presence of such tests can either validate a base or warn that the range has more work to do. Timelines are vague, and a long accumulation period can stretch for years before any decisive breakout. Reports that BlackRock may use Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin have added fuel to the fire. News like that has pushed sentiment upward and sparked fresh technical calls, with some forecasts ranging from $6 to $14 in near- to mid-term scenarios. Other voices go far beyond, naming targets that would imply market caps so large they would be hard to reconcile with today’s market size. These more extreme numbers should be treated with caution, because they assume near-perfect conditions and massive capital flows that may never arrive. Still, adoption whispers can tilt sentiment and speed up moves when buyers pile in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Word has it that the 2026 World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos event went down as the worst ever in WEF’s history. Maybe it has to do with Trump’s showing up and everybody, including the Swiss Government, falling on their knees to please the emperor without clothes; and / or because Larry Fink, the BlackRock Chair, now literally owns the WEF and calls the shot on everything. Everyone below him, even the co-chairs, are YES-people. What is playing out ever clearer is a digital-financial dictatorship, largely run by robotized humanoids. As long as the money flows – and flowing it does, better believe it – everything is allowed. President Trump was literally uprooting Davos, the Swiss Government, and foremost the Swiss air traffic – see below. He also uprooted the stock market, not by accident. When Trump first talked about his “sanctioning” the eight (8) EU countries and NATO partners that opposed his invasion of Greenland, the stock market slumped by record rates: The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 870 points (approx. 1.8%-1.9%), while the S&P 500 fell 2.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.4%. When shortly after his WEF speech, Trump reversed his decision on the 10% tariff for EU opposition, the stock market rebounded. Guess who are the main winners and losers of this algorithmically-driven game? Right, the ultra-rich, like the Elon Musks of this world. The common people as usual are the losers. On freedom of speech of the so-called democracy – which was and is a scam — has never existed, not even in Greece of 2,300 years ago, Delphi was a farce perpetuated to this day, as the Greek know very well – so, on freedom of speech, for example, Trump tried to block California’s Governor Gavin Newsom from attending Davos. Mr. Newsom came anyway – see this and this. Everything, including WEF’s treatment of staff, was horrible, although up-front the Davos organizing staff were praised for a good job. In reality, they were treated by WEF “superiors” like slaves, with insults, and disrespect. And that after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Financial Times (FT) had already investigated the WEF in 2024 and 2025 for suspected “irregularities” – concerning especially Klaus Schwab, and for sexual harassment of female employees, regarding Schwab and WEF management. An investigation by lawyers hired by the very WEF vindicated Schwab and the WEF in 2025 from any wrongdoing, as could be expected. So, the WEF management starts on a new slate, so to speak. But the old dirt shines through the new slate, and becomes even worse, as Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, by far the largest financier of the WEF, has become one of WEF’s co-chairs, and now effectively owns the WEF. BlackRock and Vanguard, the two intimately connected and legally interchangeable financial behemoths, manage worldwide corporate assets valued between US$ 25 and US$ 35 trillion. They basically run and decide over every vital sector in the world, including food, energy, banking, production, military and services industries – you name it – with a majority ownership. Speaking at the WEF, Larry Fink, sounded like a polite financial autocrat, clearly pointing the way to an all-digitized monetary system, controlled by electronic IDs, insinuating to be monitored by BlackRock-Vanguard (although never mentioning Vanguard by name). In other words, Larry Fink and his ilk pretend to control your money, the way you spend it – or not – and whether you behave in style with the elite oligarchs’ narrative to continue being able to use your earned money, or have it blocked for misbehavior. We are in the hands of psychopaths, who are allowed covering a worldwide audience with their annual Davos event, another nail in the WEF’s coffin. To complement Larry Fink’s finance-digital ruling, Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Davos on 22 January, engaging in a 30-minute conversation with Larry Fink. His remarks focused on technology’s role in securing humanity’s future through an absurdly promised abundance, multi-planetary expansion, and cautious AI advancement. The tech oligarch pointed to their companies’ shared goal: maximizing civilization’s probability of a great future by extending consciousness beyond Earth, adding that his SpaceX’s 9,000 satellites confirm that there is no evidence of aliens “out there”, that life is indeed a “rare tiny candle” in a vast darkness. Elon’s sci-fi mind aspired to die on Mars “just not on impact,” [hahaha]; and aging reversal seems solvable via a body-wide “clock”. Whatever that means. AI will probe existence’s mysteries. In brief, he painted the oligarch’s usual rosy “bla-bla-picture” that any thinking individual knows, means exactly the contrary. See this. Back to the 2026 WEF and Trump in Davos: what no mainstream will report — the airport in Zurich was blocked on Wednesday morning with numerous Trump planes, several cargos, C-130’s and the sort, for Trump’s limousine convoys and private helicopters flown in from Washington. The so called “plane spotters” at 6 AM on 21 January were crushing barricades at Zurich airport to see Trump arrive, whenever he arrived, later than he should have, due to a last-minute change of airplane. Several planes carrying heads of state to go to Davos, i.e., from Greece and Cyprus, could not land at Zurich airport. There was no more space, since in addition to Trump’s extra planes, there were an unprecedented 850 private jets also parked at the airport from WEF attendees. Compare this with 65 for the COP29 (November 2024) Summit at Baku, Azerbaijan. The politicians who could not land – and many others, of course — had to cancel their attendance in Davos. For sure, no big loss. Some of the 3,000 attendees in Davos, heads of State, highly educated (or one would think) corporate CEO’s, managing trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of people, caused literally a stampede to enter the room where Trump was blabbering for over 70 minutes – when normally heads of states are allocated 10 to 20-minute slots. These high-level WEF attendees were running – charging – into and over the organizing staff, crushing them against the walls, hurting one lady so badly she had to leave, so they could enter the special conference room where Trump was to speak. That demonstrates a conscience level of high-flying WEF attendee-billionaires comparable to football fans. Swiss military, two rows of them, were placed inside the room, instead of outside, to help prevent a stampede. Stupidity increasingly worldwide knows no frontiers. The entire WEF meetings had to be reorganized and last-minute restructured for Trump, and of course BlackRock calls the shots on everything. As Trump and BlackRock’s Larry Fink indicated, though not in words, in their WEF speeches – we are racing towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda which never left us. This 2030 agenda, also called the Great Reset, prepared for over 100 years, represents a complete destruction of civilization’s orders and laws, towards societal chaos and ever-changing values – from where they, the monsters behind the WEF, expect the emergence of a “New World Order”, under a “One World Government.” This One World Government may be based on “multiple pillars” [they call it multi-polar to once again deceive the public at large], pillars, represented by world powers other than the United States, like Russia and China. This explains why and how Trump could invade Venezuela on January 3, 2026, and kidnap President Maduro, killing over 100 people, without any material interference of Russia and China, at the time also present with their respective navies in the Caribbean. They were informed in advance. Their protests came in words, no actions. Words are blowing in the wind. These secondary thoughts and ideas are expressed in hidden messages by the WEF and its elite attendees, because they represent a worldwide Cult which is currently in control of our civilization. And you may guess, who is behind this Cult. According to Cult wisdom – call it Cult science – any actions or plans MUST be announced in one form or another to the populace concerned, so that it will be successful. Hence the many “predictive” monster and horror movies produced by Hollywood. Just look at the current list of the “10 best movies” as the 2026 Oscar nominees. See this. They all keep humanity on low vibrations which is a MUST for them manipulating human minds, preventing them from ascending to a higher level of consciousness. As an example, look at horror-vampire flick, “Sinners” which was literally nominated for every category of Oscars. The coordination between the WEF, those who pull the strings behind it, and all the 2030 Agenda agents and actors used to control humanity, among them Hollywood, is perfect. But there comes the point where the apparently limitless exuberance of sugar-charged energy brains, à la “We can do what we want, nobody stops us” – like Trump’s – will backfire. So, in the end, this horrifying organization called WEF is self-destructing. It MUST be. The faster the better. At the same time, think THE NOW gives humanity a chance for a new start outside of the slavehood of our digital monetary system and digital control-gulag. May there be soon an end to our dystopian Cult world. Instead, let us open our hearts and souls for Love and Light to emerge on our Blue Planet’s sentinel beings. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Standing in the Rose Garden last April, flanked by American flags, US President Donald Trump declared war on free trade. Nine months later, the most striking feature of that declaration is not how much commerce has collapsed, but how quickly it has rerouted. Trade did not stop; it flowed around obstacles. As a DHL Express company executive observed, trade “will find its way” — behaving, in effect, like water flowing around obstacles under high-tariff regimes. That image of water seeking a new channel captures the first-order reality of the Trump administration’s trade policy. Tariffs have risen sharply, and the costs are landing where economists would expect: higher prices for tariff-sensitive goods, stress on firms reliant on imported inputs, and an implicit tax on households and businesses. Yet the system has adapted. The US is buying less directly from China, but more from Chinese-owned factories operating in lower-tariff jurisdictions such as Vietnam. Mexico has emerged as an unexpected winner. And Beijing’s leverage over rare earth minerals has spurred new efforts to secure alternative supply — an industrial-policy subplot nested inside a tariff story. The second-order reality is more subtle: Trade policy uncertainty also influences the US Treasury market through financial market sentiment. Asset-manager commentary from institutions such as BlackRock and Amundi emphasizes that tariff escalation can increase macroeconomic uncertainty, raise bond market volatility and affect term premia. In this environment, investor demand for duration becomes more cautious, implying an indirect but economically meaningful link between trade policy uncertainty and Treasury yields beyond mechanical supply-and-demand effects. Understanding the Treasury channel requires starting with the obvious, then moving to the consequential. Obviously, tariffs raise revenue. Consequentially, the Treasury market is where America prices its future, and where policy uncertainty becomes a term premium that households and businesses end up paying. CAPTION: Term premium on a ten-year zero-coupon bond. Via Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Tariffs are blunt. When imposed broadly, they raise costs across wide swaths of the economy. A tariff on an imported refrigerator is not just a tax on the foreign producer; it becomes a higher landed cost for the importer, which becomes either a lower profit margin, a higher price for the consumer or a combination of both. Tariffs can also lift the price of domestic substitutes: If imported steel becomes more expensive, domestic steel producers can raise prices too, even if their cost base didn’t change as much. For consumers, the effect shows up in specific aisles: higher prices for furniture, toys and clothing; higher prices for some foods like beef, bananas and coffee; and price pressures that spread unevenly across regions and income groups. For firms, tariffs are less a doctrine than a daily problem to be managed. One small but telling example comes from the trade-law trenches. Dan Harris, a Seattle lawyer who recently began working on tariffs, now advises importers on how to legally reduce duty exposure. The methods are not dramatic — restructuring contracts, separating allowable costs, adjusting declared values within the rules — but they absorb time, capital and attention that would otherwise be spent on production or expansion. This logic repeats across supply chains. A buyer who purchases an injection mold outright avoids embedding that cost in the tariff base of every imported unit. The decision is rational and lawful, yet it underscores a broader pattern: tariffs redirect effort toward avoidance rather than efficiency. The same dynamic appears in Vietnam, where factories have seen sudden order surges as US buyers shift away from China — only to face capacity constraints and renewed uncertainty as tariffs spread. Supply chains adapt, but the adaptation itself is costly, unstable and rarely conducive to long-term productivity growth. The US budget deficit is large by historic standards — 6.2% of GDP in recent readings, roughly double the average pace from 1980 through the pre-Covid-19 pandemic era. Bigger deficits mean more Treasury issuance. If all else is equal, more supply requires either more demand or higher yields to clear the market. Tariff revenue can, in principle, reduce the borrowing needed at the margin. Customs receipts have risen sharply in the high-tariff world, creating what some policymakers see as a fiscal cushion. But the margin matters: If tariffs generate tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue, that is meaningful — yet it is not transformative against structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and debt service costs. The more important issue for markets is not just how much tariff revenue is collected, but how reliable that revenue is. Tariff receipts are unusually exposed to legal risk (court challenges to executive tariff authority), negotiation risk (trade deals that reduce rates or carve out exemptions) and macroeconomic risk (recessions or demand shifts that shrink import volumes). As the Bipartisan Policy Center explains, tariff revenue fluctuates with trade policy, legal outcomes and import behavior, making it an inherently volatile source of funding rather than a stable offset to deficits. That volatility matters because bond markets price expectations and risk, not static arithmetic. Even when tariff revenue rises into the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, it remains small relative to structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and rising interest costs. PBS NewsHour shows that claims of tariffs meaningfully stabilizing the fiscal outlook break down once the scale of federal spending and borrowing is considered. Treasury yields therefore respond less to the existence of tariff revenue than to uncertainty around the longer-term fiscal path. When investors believe deficits may widen — because tariff revenue falls short, spending rises faster than expected or borrowing needs surprise to the upside — they demand higher compensation to hold long-dated debt. Because Treasury yields anchor mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, that repricing quickly tightens financial conditions across the economy. Tariffs may reduce borrowing at the margin, but by introducing uncertainty into revenue projections, they can also raise risk premia — offsetting part of the perceived fiscal “cushion.” If supply is one side of Treasury pricing, demand is the other — and trade policy influences demand most clearly through foreign investor behavior. Foreign investors hold roughly one-third of the US Treasury market, making their portfolio decisions central to US interest rate dynamics. During periods of tariff escalation, Council on Foreign Relations reports often raise concerns about a potential “sell America” trade, in which foreign official institutions reduce exposure to US assets as trade relationships deteriorate. Historically, however, such fears have rarely materialized in abrupt form. Even during episodes of trade conflict, foreign holdings of Treasuries have often remained stable or increased, reflecting Treasuries’ role as the world’s deepest and most liquid pool of safe collateral. In an environment of global uncertainty, investors typically prioritize liquidity and capital preservation, even when they are uncomfortable with the policy environment generating that uncertainty. The more relevant risk, therefore, is gradual erosion at the margin. Central banks and sovereign wealth funds rarely engage in headline-grabbing sales. Instead, they can diversify quietly over time by allowing maturing Treasury holdings to roll off and reinvesting incrementally elsewhere. Over years, these slow-moving adjustments can meaningfully affect demand conditions at the margin. Trade relationships matter in this process. Reserve composition has historically been influenced by trade networks, with countries tending to hold reserves in the currencies of their primary trading partners. If US protectionism leads to sustained shifts in global trade toward alternative hubs, reserve portfolios may adjust gradually in parallel — without a single triggering event, but with cumulative effects over time. From a market perspective, this distinction holds weight. Treasury demand remains deep and resilient, but it is not immutable. Persistent trade fragmentation can slowly reshape the composition of global reserves, subtly reducing marginal demand for US debt even in the absence of overt selling pressure. Such shifts are easy to overlook in the short term, yet increasingly relevant for long-term rate expectations and term premia. The third channel operates through the macro economy: how tariffs affect inflation and growth, and how those effects are ultimately priced into financial markets. Tariffs tend to raise prices directly by increasing import costs and indirectly by expanding domestic firms’ pricing power. At the same time, they can weigh on growth by raising input costs, disrupting supply chains and provoking retaliation. The resulting combination, higher inflation risk alongside weaker or more uncertain growth, is precisely the configuration that markets associate with elevated macro risk rather than a straightforward demand slowdown. Markets typically express this tension through the yield curve. When investors believe tariffs will push up near-term inflation while clouding the longer-term outlook for growth, productivity and policy stability, longer-dated yields can rise even as growth expectations soften. This reflects the role of term premia. The long end of the curve is not simply a forecast of future short rates; it also embeds compensation for inflation volatility, fiscal uncertainty and policy risk. Recent market behavior reinforces this interpretation. Gold prices have continued to rise even as US yields remain elevated, signaling that higher yields are no longer being read as a clean indicator of safety. Instead, both gold prices and long-term Treasury yields appear to be responding to the same underlying force: a rise in uncertainty and risk premia. When yields increase because investors demand additional compensation for fiscal, geopolitical and policy risk — rather than because growth prospects are improving — the opportunity cost of holding gold becomes less binding. In that sense, gold is not competing with Treasuries on yield, but reacting to doubts about their reliability as the world’s unquestioned safe asset. Geopolitical shocks can accelerate this dynamic. Recent US military actions involving Venezuela briefly pushed gold prices higher, not because they altered global trade flows in a material way, but because they reinforced perceptions of geopolitical fragility layered on top of trade and fiscal uncertainty. Such episodes matter less for their direct economic impact than for what they reveal about market psychology: When policy and geopolitical risks stack, investors demand protection that sits outside sovereign balance sheets. This framework helps explain why JP Morgan’s bullish outlook for gold remains intact even without aggressive Federal Reserve (or Fed) easing. As long as term premia stay elevated, central banks continue to diversify reserves and geopolitical flashpoints remain unresolved, higher US yields do not suppress gold prices. Instead, they reinforce incentives to diversify away from US financial assets altogether. In that sense, gold’s rise toward $5,000 per ounce by late 2026 would not represent an anomaly driven by temporary fear, but a new equilibrium consistent with a more fragmented and risk-conscious global financial system. The implications extend beyond gold. The same uncertainty that lifts demand for alternative stores of value also pushes up term premia in the Treasury market. Long-term yields rise not in anticipation of stronger growth, but as compensation for volatility and unpredictability. That repricing feeds directly into higher borrowing costs across the economy, tightening financial conditions even when the underlying trade shock itself appears manageable. For households and firms, this channel is where trade policy becomes tangible. The ten-year Treasury yield anchors borrowing costs across the economy, including mortgage rates, auto loans and corporate financing. If tariffs contribute to persistently higher term premia, it results in a durable tightening of financial conditions, often outweighing any localized employment gains associated with reshoring or import substitution. Higher yields also feed back into public finances. Rising interest rates increase government debt service costs, tightening the fiscal constraint and reinforcing deficit dynamics over time. What begins as a trade policy shock can therefore reappear as a budgetary one, amplifying longer-term sustainability concerns. Globally, higher US yields tend to transmit tighter financial conditions abroad through capital flows and exchange rate pressures, increasing stress in more vulnerable economies. In that sense, the macro consequences of tariffs are not confined to domestic prices or output; they propagate through global financial channels. For these reasons, Treasury yields are not merely an economic statistic. They are a strategic price — summarizing how trade policy, inflation risk, fiscal dynamics and global financial conditions intersect in real time. The industry stories from the tariff era are familiar by now: lawyers building compliance playbooks, factories booming in Vietnam, Mexico benefiting from trade diversion, grocery importers cancelling shipments, governments accelerating rare earth strategies. Together, they reinforce the comforting saying that trade behaves like water: Block one channel and it simply flows around the obstacle. That metaphor is only half true. Trade does reroute. The world does not stop trading because one country raises tariffs. But rerouting is not costless. It can be inflationary, as supply chains move to higher-cost locations. It can lower productivity by fragmenting production networks built for efficiency. It can shift bargaining power across firms, workers and countries. And most importantly for markets, it raises uncertainty. In financial markets, uncertainty comes with a price. In the Treasury market, it appears as a higher term premium — the extra return investors demand to hold long-dated US debt when the economic and policy outlook feels less predictable. That premium does not stay in the bond market. It is transmitted directly into mortgage rates, corporate financing costs and global capital flows. Because US Treasuries are the benchmark asset of the global financial system, changes in their pricing ripple outward. What begins as a trade policy shock can become a broad tightening of financial conditions, shaping investment decisions at home and exporting stress abroad. This is where trade policy becomes strategic. As economists Emmanuel Farhi and Matteo Maggiori argue in their model of the international monetary system, the global role of US debt rests on credibility — the belief that American public liabilities are safe, liquid and insulated from short-term political shocks. That credibility allows the United States to borrow cheaply and at scale. Paradoxically, a policy framed as strengthening national power, if mishandled, can weaken the foundation of that power. Tariffs may redirect trade. But if they also raise uncertainty and risk premia, they can quietly erode the credibility and attractiveness of US debt — the asset on which American economic power ultimately rests. The trade war has not broken global commerce but redirected it. Firms and countries are adapting quickly — routing around tariffs, shifting production footprints, building new compliance strategies and rebalancing trade relationships. That adaptability is real and will likely persist. But adaptation carries costs, and the most important costs may not appear on a customs receipt. They may appear as a higher term premium in the Treasury market — a subtle repricing of US policy uncertainty that raises borrowing costs for households, businesses and the federal government itself. This year and beyond, the most strategic way to think about tariffs is as a variable that interacts with Treasury supply, Treasury demand and the Fed’s inflation calculus. A trade policy that treats the Treasury market as an afterthought risks turning a tariff shock into a bond shock.

Title: Coinbase CEO Shares 6 Takeaways From WEF Davos 2026 – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-ceo-shares-six-takeaways-from-wef-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T12:00:39Z

While Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao made the headlines following his interview at the just-concluded World Economic Forum, where he called a Bitcoin supercycle in 2026, his crypto counterpart and Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, has come forward with feedback from the global event held in Davos, Switzerland. In a January 24 post on the social media platform X, Armstrong shared a few key “themes and takeaways” from the latest edition of WEF. After admitting that the conference offered a productive time of meeting people one-on-one, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the major focus was on pushing crypto adoption globally. Starting his list of takeaways, Armstrong highlighted that everyone was talking about tokenization, which is beginning to expand to every asset class in the world. The crypto leader said to expect some major progress in the tokenization sector in 2026, especially as the Fortune 500 business leaders continuously lean in. Secondly, the Coinbase CEO shared that crypto legislation and the CLARITY Act were another area of focus, as the government of the day looks to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. According to Armstrong, most of the bank CEOs he met at the WEF in the past week are actually pro-crypto. Armstrong wrote on X: One CEO of a top 10 global bank told me crypto is their number one priority, and they view it as existential. Furthermore, the Coinbase CEO lauded the Trump administration as the most crypto-forward government in the world at the moment. Armstrong acknowledged their progress with the crypto market structure, stating that these clear rules are crucial for global competitiveness and will put money back in people’s pockets. In what seemed like a cheeky tone, Armstrong mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) topics didn’t come up throughout the forum. According to the crypto founder, the week felt productive, as it centered around real, global progress — all thanks to BlackRock CEO and new WEF co-chair Larry Fink. The Coinbase leader touted crypto and AI (artificial intelligence) as the most talked-about technologies in today’s world. Highlighting their compatibility, Armstrong stated that AI agents will eventually default to using stablecoins for payments, as they cannot be KYC’d like human beings. Finally, Armstrong revealed that the Coinbase, Circle, and Bermuda partnership to build a fully on-chain economy was announced at WEF Davos 2026. “Excited to make progress on this and create a compelling case study for other nations to follow,” the crypto CEO concluded. As of this writing, the global cryptocurrency market has a total capitalization of $3.086 trillion, with Bitcoin retaining its spot as the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

January 25, 2026 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz Avert your eyes! My Sunday morning look at incompetency, corruption and policy failures: • I’ve Covered Police Abuse for 20 Years. What ICE Is Doing Is Different. There were no promises of an impartial investigation. There was no regret or remorse. There was little empathy for her family — for her parents, her partner or the children she left behind. From the moment the world learned about her death, the administration pronounced the shooting not only justified but an act of heroism worthy of praise and celebration. (New York Times) • We Are Witnessing the Self-Immolation of a Superpower: With Donald Trump’s actions in Greenland, Minneapolis, and Venezuela, a foreign enemy could not invent a better chain of events to wreck the standing of the United States. (Wired) see also America vs. the World: President Trump wants to return to the 19th century’s international order. He will leave America less prosperous—and the whole world less secure. (The Atlantic) see also This Is the End: Putinism abroad always morphs into Putinism at home. And we chose this path. Why? Because something-something the price of eggs. (The Bulwark) • The rich are powering spending, with the U.S. economy in a danger zone: The health of the economy increasingly depends on rich people spending money, a new analysis of government data finds. That puts the U.S. in a fragile place because consumer spending drives growth — so the entire economy is now relying on a smaller number of people to keep things afloat. (Axios) • When Chicago pawned its parking meters: The deal Chicago made would go down as one of the most notorious miscalculations in the history of city government. It would call into question what the government is even supposed to do, and become a textbook case on the potential pitfalls of privatization. (NPR) • They’ve bought themselves a Congress: Coinbase calls the shots in the Senate; former New York City Mayor Eric Adams faces rug pull allegations, and a crypto executive is breaking up with Trump. (Citation Needed) • Inside Bari Weiss’s Hostile Takeover of CBS News: The network’s new editor-in-chief has championed a press free from élite bias, while aligning herself with a billionaire class more willing than ever to indulge Donald Trump. (New Yorker) • How Donald Trump Has Transformed ICE: A former D.H.S. oversight official on what, legally, the agency can and can’t do—and the accountability mechanisms that have been “gutted beyond recognition.” (New Yorker) see also “ICE 101″ — How Trump changed ICE and CBP into a fascist secret police: ICE and CBP are fatally flawed products of the post-9/11 War on Terror — now Trump has weaponized those very flaws to occupy America. (Doomsday Scenario) • DOGE staffer signed deal to share Social Security data with election deniers: In an extraordinary court filing, “NOTICE OF CORRECTIONS TO THE RECORD,” government lawyers representing the SSA revealed that in March 2025, a DOGE staffer signed an agreement to share the private data of Americans with a “political advocacy group” seeking to “overturn election results in certain States.” WTF? (Popular Information) • Rejecting Decades of Science, Vaccine Panel Chair Says Polio and Other Shots Should Be Optional: Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who leads the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said a person’s right to refuse a vaccine outweighed concerns about illness or death from infectious diseases. (New York Times) see also The Quiet Misogyny of RFK Jr.’s War on Science: The burdens of so many of these proposals fall disproportionately on women, and moms in particular. (Slate) • A Year Inside Kash Patel’s F.B.I. Forty-five current and former employees on the changes they say are undermining the agency and making America less safe.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $1.33 Billion Outflow In 2026 See-Saw Performance
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-1-33-billion-outflow-see-saw/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T06:00:06Z

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs continue to witness a volatile start to 2026, with back-to-back weeks showing sharply contrasting performance. After netting a staggering $1.42 billion in weekly netflows on January 16, market momentum soon swung the opposite way in line with a Bitcoin decline, forcing a net outflow of $1.33 billion over the last week. A similar phenomenon was seen in the first two weeks of the year, after an initial net deposit of $458.77 million by January 2 was followed by a net outflow of $681.01 million by January 9. This investor behavior suggests a highly reactive market with little long-term confidence. In analyzing the most recent wave of withdrawals in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market, data from SoSoValue shows that the fourth trading week of January recorded no single day with a positive netflow. The heaviest outflows totaled $708.71 million on January 21, followed by the smallest daily outflow of $32.11 million on January 22. Looking at individual funds, BlackRock’s IBIT, the market leader, suffered the largest net outflows valued at $537.49 million. As usual, Fidelity’s FBTC ranks a close second with redemptions surpassing deposits by $451.50 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with heavy net outflows also included Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which suffered losses estimated at $172.09 million, $66.25 million, and $76.19 million, respectively. Meanwhile, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also experienced net outflows between $6 million and $11 million. Notably, Grayscale’s BTC, Invesco’s BTCO, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI recorded the least activity with zero netflows. At press time, total net assets for the Bitcoin Spot ETFs stand at $115.88 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for over 54% of these holdings, as the undisputed market leader. Meanwhile, total cumulative net inflow is presently valued at $56.49 billion. Related Reading: Monero, Zcash, And Dash Prohibited In India Amid Money-Laundering Crackdown According to more data from SoSoValue, the Ethereum Spot ETFs also witnessed massive levels of redemptions in the last trading week, resulting in a net outflow of $611.17 million. Similar to its Bitcoin counterpart, the BlackRock ETHA also produced the largest net withdrawals valued at $431.50 million. Presently, the total net assets for the Ethereum Spot ETFs are valued at $17.70 billion, representing 4.99% of Ethereum’s market cap. Meanwhile, the cumulative total net inflow is valued at $12.30 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of analysts believe Ethereum’s current price action is being misunderstood. Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem. Speaking of staking, BitMine Technologies recently amped up its ETH staking to over $5.71 billion worth of Ethereum. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the firm has staked an additional 171,264, worth $503.2 million, pushing its total stake to over 1.94 million ETH.

Title: $7 Trillion Player Is Moving Into Bitcoin, Can This Trigger A Surge To $200,000?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/7-trillion-player-eye-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T00:30:06Z

Swiss banking giant UBS, with assets under management (AuM) of up to $7 trillion, is set to launch Bitcoin trading for some of its clients. This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley, in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients, although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Amazon braces for another major round of layoffs, 14,000 jobs at risk

MYNORTHWEST NEWS Jan 22, 2026, 10:19 PM | Updated: 10:23 pm A sign for an Amazon Go retail store is seen at the Amazon.com Inc. headquarters. (Photo: David Ryder, Getty Images) (Photo: David Ryder, Getty Images) BY MYNORTHWEST STAFF MyNorthwest.com Amazon is expected to undergo another round of layoffs next week, according to an exclusive report from Reuters, in an effort to trim its workforce by approximately 30,000 employees. This is considered the next round of layoffs that first occurred in October, two sources who asked not to be identified told Reuters. During the October round of layoffs, 14,000 employees were laid off. The second round, which can begin as early as Tuesday, is expected to affect roughly the same number of employees. Included in the layoffs are jobs within the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology departments. MyNorthwest has reached out to Amazon for comment. In October, Amazon cut approximately 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. According to a letter to employees from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, those laid off would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said he anticipated that generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce over the next few years. Amazon is investing $10 billion toward building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 began, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio, and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. The 14,000 jobs cut in October were the biggest wave of layoffs since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs over a two-month period. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week, but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower.

Title: XRP Ledger Enters The AI Era As Ripple Merges Two Mega Trends

The XRP Ledger has entered a new phase of innovation as Ripple integrates to bring together two of the most powerful technology trends shaping the global economy. Long known for its speed, low transaction costs, and enterprise-grade reliability, the Ledger is now expanding beyond payments to data-driven and automated financial applications. By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement.

Ripple AI-powered systems continuously process large volumes of payment data in real time, allowing financial institutions to make dynamic decisions on the most effective payment paths. BlackRock is now using Ripple’s RLUSD as collateral, which is extremely bullish for XRP. JackTheRippler revealed that the altcoin is being positioned as the future infrastructure, which is being built with the potential to hit over $10,000 per coin. With the REAL token launching on January 26th, trillions in global capital could flood into the XRP Ledger. According to JackTheRippler, some projections suggest up to $800 billion could flow into the REAL token on XRP Ledger, potentially sparking a powerful supply shock. The rise of the phoenix XRP is here. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull highlighted that Caroline Pham isn’t just another name in crypto. Pham played a role in pushing utility regulation into the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), helping shift policy toward real-world use cases. Currently, she is at MoonPlay and posting about the phoenix on X. Related Reading: How Donald Trump’s Latest Crypto Move Will Boost Demand For XRP Years ago, Brad Garlinghouse drew that same phoenix, and it became one of the biggest pieces of XRP lore. While the market chased narratives, Ripple has been building institutional-grade crypto products for years. Meanwhile, the token, RLUSD, and the XRP Ledger are now live operating, and recognized among the most compliant blockchain assets in the crypto world. This is the same asset that survived the SEC’s biggest regulatory battles in crypto history, and is now on the other side with legal clarity, growing integration, and increasing relevance to government infrastructure in its favor. Xfinancebull concluded that Caroline has helped clear the regulatory path, Brad and Ripple built what actually runs on that path, and they have been aligning all along, which is how the real adoption happens.

UFC makes Paramount Plus debut with much-anticipated match When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. UFC 324 live streams will see the much-anticipated Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett match in the main event slot at the T-Mobile Arena, as the two battle it out in Las Vegas for the interim Lightweight Championship in current no. 1 Ilia Topuria's absence – and there's a sneaky way to watch UFC 324 for free. Gaethje has been here before, taking the interim title six years ago at UFC 249. He's tasted defeat three times since that night in Jacksonville, and this might be his last shot at UFC gold. Pimblett, on the other hand, is a star in the rise and the Brit has yet to lose in the organization since his 2021 debut. Can he now add a championship to his vast popularity around the world? This weekend's main card also sees two of UFC's best bantamweights – Sean O'Malley and Song Yadong – return to the Octagon after long layoffs to stake their claim to challenge for Petr Yan's recently re-acquired title. While Natália Silva vs Rose Namajunas headlines the women's action. With Paramount Plus picking up the coverage for the first time in the US, here's where to watch UFC 324 live streams online and from anywhere with a VPN. Exclusive US coverage of the UFC 324 main card is on Paramount Plus. It's being headlined by Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett, which is expected to start at around 11pm ET / 8pm PT. Plans start from only $8.99 a month with the Paramount Plus Essential Plan, or upgrade to Premium for $13.99 a month (see below for more details). You can also get a Paramount Plus trial with Walmart+ as with this sneaky freebie-hacking trick we found. While Paramount Plus will show UFC 324 in its entirety, you can also watch the Early Prelims with the UFC Fight Pass. Traveling outside of the US? Use a VPN to watch Paramount Plus from abroad while you're away from home. Upgrade to Paramount Plus Premium A Paramount Plus Premium subscription gives you access to UFC events, Champions League soccer, 40,000 episodes & movies on demand without ads, Showtime content, and live streams of everything CBS has to offer. Plus, you'll get to watch selected shows and sports in glorious 4K. Go Premium for $13.99 a month or $140 for the whole year This is handy piece of software that can make your device appear as if it's back in your home country, thereby letting you unlock your usual service. The best VPN right now? We recommend NordVPN – it does everything and comes with a 70% discount. 🟩 NordVPN – get the world's best VPNNot having a VPN is like leaving your front door wide open in a busy city – anyone can walk right in and take a peek. TechRadar regularly reviews all the biggest and best VPN providers and NordVPN is our #1 choice. ✅ 70% Off Today✅ 3 Extra Months Free✅ Unlocks Paramount Plus Get NordVPN and stream UFC 324 from anywhere. Using a VPN is incredibly simple: 1. Install the VPN of your choice. As we've said, NordVPN is our favourite. 2. Choose the location you wish to connect to in the VPN app. For instance, if you're visiting the UK and want to view your usual US service, you'd select a United States-based server from the list. 3. Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to your usual local streaming service and watch the UFC. TNT Sports Box Office has exclusive broadcast rights to UFC 324 in the UK, with the PPV rate set at £19.99. Once ordered, you can watch the event through your choice of Discovery+, Sky, Amazon Prime Video, EE TV or Virgin Media. The main card action is set to begin at 2am GMT on Sunday morning. UFC Fight Pass subscribers can also watch the Prelims and Early Prelims there. If you're abroad whilst the fight is on, a VPN like NordVPN can help you to access your home streaming services from anywhere. There are a host of pay-per-view providers offering a UFC 324 live stream in Canada. You can head to the likes of Sportsnet, Bell or the UFC Fight Pass to watch the whole event, where the PPV price is set at $69.99. Prelims will also be shown on Sportsnet and TVA Sports. North of the border from the US? You can use NordVPN to watch your Paramount Plus subscription like you were back at home. Sunday's Main Card at UFC 324 will be available on PPV in Australia, setting you back AU$59.95 from Foxtel Main Event or Kayo Sports Main Event. That means you can live stream UFC 324 via your web browser and devices like Android, iOS, Samsung TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Telstra TV and Chromecast. You can also catch all the Prelims via Paramount+ and Network 10. Downloading a VPN will help you access your subscriptions from anywhere if you're abroad when the fight is on. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to watch UFC 324 for free. It's on Paramount Plus in the US, which no longer carries a free trial. And it's on PPV in many other countries around the world. The UFC 324 Main Card is scheduled to begin at 9pm ET / 6pm ET on Saturday, January 24. That's 2am GMT or 1pm AEDT in the UK and Australia on Sunday, January 25. Before that, the Early Prelims start at 5pm ET / 2pm PT / 10pm GMT and the Prelims at 7pm PT / 4pm PT / 12am GMT. Yes. Most broadcasters have streaming services that you can access through mobile apps or via your phone's browser – Paramount Plus, Discovery+ and Kayo Sports all have mobile apps, for example. You can also stay up-to-date with the latest UFC news and plays on the official social media channels on X (@ufc), Instagram (@ufc), Facebook (UFC) TikTok (@ufc) and YouTube (@ufc).

Accurate. --Elon Musk✓ @elonmusk Video Transcript You know, we always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large developed countries that have xenophobic immigration policies, they don't allow anybody to come in, shrinking unemployment, excuse me, shrinking demographics, these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology. And if the promise, I didn't say it's going to happen, but if the promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will, we'll be able to elevate the standard of living of countries, the standard of living of individuals, even with shrinking populations. And so the paradigm of negative population growth is going to be changing. And the social problems that one will have in substituting humans for machines is going to be far easier in those countries that have declining populations. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

Title: Bitcoin price to hit $180,000 if it overcomes this hurdle, analyst says
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-to-180000-if-one-thing-does-not-happen/
Time Published: 2026-01-24T17:51:24Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link Fears of quantum computing breaking Bitcoin’s encryption continue to plague Bitcoin investors. In fact, Eliezer Ndinga, global head of research at 21Shares, reckons that unless developers address the concern, Bitcoin won’t enjoy a rally anytime soon. But if developers act? It’s clear, blue skies. “If we get past the quantum threat, then Bitcoin can go to $180,000,” Ndinga told DL News. For now, however, “it’s a cloud in the air.” Every day more market watchers are cropping up and labelling quantum computing Bitcoin’s most pressing threat. Adding to Ndinga, Sergio Ermotti, CEO of Swiss investment bank UBS, said that Bitcoin needs to prove itself able to overcome quantum computing. Ray Dalio and BlackRock have made similar comments. They aren’t the only ones, however. Just last week, Christopher Wood, of Jefferies Group, removed Bitcoin from his long-standing portfolio recommendation. Instead, he’s urging investors to double down on gold and gold-mining stocks. “In the world of institutional allocation, virtually everyone I have talked to is quietly concerned about Bitcoin,” Nic Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, previously told DL News. Of late, Bitcoin developers and the broader community are finding themselves fighting over a vulnerability that hadn’t been taken seriously. Why are investors so fearful now? Because advances in quantum computing are coming at a rapid pace, and if the technology falls into the wrong hands, it could potentially break Bitcoin’s entire encryption model. Researchers at Chaincode Labs discovered that 20% to 50% of all Bitcoin could be stolen by actors using quantum computers. We’re talking about $400 billion to $900 billion that could be lost — including Satoshi Nakamoto’s alleged 1 million Bitcoin stash. In an interview with DL News, the first thing that Ndinga said was that quantum computing is a real threat. “The challenge is that we’re drowning in information but starving for a reason,” Ndinga said. “Crypto has to get past its teenage years and address this seriously.” When asked to rate the quantum threat on a scale of one to ten, Ndinga broke it down into two dimensions: timing and magnitude. “On magnitude, you’re talking about potentially 50% of all Bitcoin at risk,” he said. “On timing, it’s harder to pin down. We could be talking about a couple of years or a couple of decades.” That uncertainty is exactly what’s creating headwinds for institutional investors, according to Ndinga. And unless he acknowledges the vulnerability, he’ll lose credibility among investors. “I won’t be taken seriously if I don’t talk about quantum computing,” he said. While institutional concern mounts, there are Bitcoin developers working on solutions — although progress is slow. One of the proposals is BIP 360, authored by developers Hunter Beast and Ethan Heilman, and podcaster Isabel Foxen Duke. “Nearly everyone has been very grateful that we are taking the problem seriously,” Beast told DL News. “Our whole motto is: prepared, not scared.” Rather than forcing a sudden network-wide upgrade, BIP 360 would introduce a new type of Bitcoin address that allows users to voluntarily move funds into quantum-resistant protections, reducing long-term exposure without breaking existing wallets, the Lightning Network, or Layer-2 systems. BIP 360 is now into its second year of development, and according to Beast, it remains one of the most widely-discussed draft BIPs in Bitcoin’s history. That means little, however, since the notoriously lethargic Bitcoin Investment Proposal process means activation could still be years away. Beast acknowledged the urgency but cautioned against rushing. “We must remain thoughtful and diligent, while not rushing a half-baked solution,” he said. “Fortunately, the general consensus is that we still have time.” Pedro Solimano is a markets correspondent based in Buenos Aires.

Poll Results: Leinster to win their 10th straight (57) Connacht to do it (8) Connacht to do it Leinster to win their 10th straight Vote Caolin Blade returns at scrum-half in a timely boost for Connacht after his five-week layoff. Blade’s return following a five-week layoff is one of just three changes made by head coach Stuart Lancaster. Out-half Josh Ioane is named outside Blade, while Dylan Tierney-Martin comes in at hooker in place of the injured Dave Heffernan. Connacht have over 850 caps worth of experience to call upon from the bench with Bundee Aki, Jack Carty and Denis Buckley all named among the replacements. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Meanwhile, Niall Smyth is set to make his Leinster debut as Leo Cullen navigates a tricky period of injuries among his tightheads. Smyth, who won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup with Blackrock in 2024, partners Jack Boyle and Gus McCarthy in the front row. Harry Byrne starts at out-half once again, while captain Caelan Doris is set to win his 100th Leinster cap. 15. Sam Gilbert 14. Shane Jennings 13. Harry West 12. Cathal Forde 11. Finn Treacy 10.

Ruben Moloney Referee: Eoghan Cross (IRFU) Just over five minutes to go until kick-off in Galway. The last time the sides met, only last month, Leinster were runaway winners in the end — but Connacht were excellent in the first half of that game at the Aviva. Imbued with home advantage and the sense of occasion in a new-look Dexcom Stadium, let’s see if this one is more competitive for 80. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Fantastic performance on the pitch pre-game, with all 26 Connacht clubs represented. Ballina man Caelan Doris leads Leinster onto the pitch to a fairly warm reception. And now here come Connacht to some serious noise! Dexcom Stadium is HOPPING. And it looks absolutely fantastic. Here we go! 1′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Harry Byrne gets us underway at The Sportsground! Taken by Cathal Forde and Connacht exit through Caolin Blade. A little bit of argy-bargy before the first lineout. Brilliant! 6′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Billy Bohan wins a scrum pen on Leinster debutant Niall Smyth and Connacht get a lineout on the Leinster 22′, but Josh Murphy spills it forward at the front. Leinster exit through Fintan Gunne, who booms it to touch on halfway. Then a half-break by Gus McCarthy who snatches one from Blade’s hands — and Leinster eventually win a penalty deep in Connacht territory as they impede Leinster at lineout time. 8′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Fintan Gunne! The scrum-half crashes over after a sharp Leinster start in attack. Byrne converts for 7-0, and there’s a further double blow for Connacht: Cathal Forde and Sam Illo are gone off, replaced by Bundee Aki Jack Aungier respectively. Not sure if either of those were HIAS — will try to keep you posted. 11′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Dylan Tierney-Martin! Connacht respond immediately! Ferocious Leinster defence, phase after phase, but Tierney-Martin burrows over with a brilliant close-range finish. That’s a serious reaction by the hosts, and Sam Gilbert chips over the afters. He’s well over 90% from the tee since arriving at Connacht — I think he’s missed only one kick?! Seven each in Galway! 15′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: First chorus of ‘The Fields’ as Eoghan Cross sets up a scrum after some brilliant Connacht defence forced a Leinster error on midfield. And in the game’s second scrum, Connacht win their second scrum penalty. This time it’s Sam Illo on Jack Boyle. Connacht lineout outside the Leinster 22′. 16′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Alex Soroka gets hands on Connacht ball in a ruck just outside the Leinster 22′ and referee Cross pings Connacht for side entry. Leinster lineout just inside the Connacht half — but Doris knocks it on on halfway. 20′ – CON 7-7 LEIN:Play stopped with Jack Boyle down, appearing to hold his calf. Andy Farrell will be holding his breath here — but Ireland’s loosehead injury crisis looks set to deepen. Stretcher coming on. Ah, Jeayyysus. Poor Boyle! That’s a massive blow to Ireland ahead of the Six Nations. 23′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Boyle is replaced by Jerry Cahir. And Billy Bohan immediately wins another penalty on Smyth. Meanwhile, Sam Illo and Cathal Forde are both back on the field having passed their HIAs. Connacht back to their starting side. The hosts then win a further penalty as Lowe infringes in a ruck. Gilbert chips over three points from close range and Connacht lead for the first time! 26′ – CON 10-7 LEIN: Leinster attempting to play with tempo but another attack in the Connacht half breaks down as Gunne tries to feed the intended decoy in Doris but passes it forward. Leinster win a scrum pen, though, as Illo is pinged for not driving straight. Harry Byrne does what Gilbert did seconds earlier and pops over the easy three points. 29′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: A madcap passage of play leads to a Gunne chip through, which dribbles into touch deep inside the Connacht 22′. Connacht lose their second straight lineout — and Leinster are knocking on the door! Penalty advantage to the visitors also. 31′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: Connacht scramble well but concede two penalties in the process. Leinster will take three points once more from close range — surprising considering Connacht are on an official warning now. 32′ – CON 10-13 LEIN: Shane Jennings wins the restart — he’s been excellent in the air once again — and Connacht wind up earning a penalty outside the Leinster 22′ as Will Connors impedes Blade on the floor at the base of a ruck. Connacht will take a shot at goal, this one from left of centre. And Sam Gilbert does what Sam Gilbert does: we’re level once more! 36′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Cian Prendergast catches Snyman with a seatbelt tackle just inside the Connacht 10′. Advantage comes to nothing and Leinster go to touch — lineout just inside the home 22′. 37′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Sean Jansen melts Gus McCarthy off the Leinster lineout and forces the knock-on. Dexcom Stadium goes nuts! What a hit. It was borderline high but the TMO has checked it in the background and can’t find any head contact. Connacht scrum inside their own 22′. Terrifically enjoyable half if far from free-flowing! Vicious, pulsating stuff. Ireland will be sweating after Jack Boyle was stretchered off for the visitors. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Connacht on top in the scrum, where they lead 3-1 on penalties. But where it matters, it’s 13-13 following first-half tries by Fintan Gunne and Dylan Tierney-Martin, with the rest of the points coming from the respective boots of Harry Byrne and Sam Gilbert. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Catch you shortly! 41′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Back underway at Dexcom! A big 40 minutes ahead on what’s been a superb occasion so far. 45′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: A really open, loose start to the second half! Connacht have a scrum well inside the Leinster half after Ciarán Frawley knocked on during an attempted rip. The hosts almost got around the Leinster blitz there — but still savage defence by the eastern province! Alex Soroka, meanwhile, looks like he’s going off for a HIA. 47′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Superb carry by Cathal Forde and he makes serious yardage deep into the Leinster 22′! Connacht go very close and Leinster concede the pen. Advantage comes to nothing, so Connacht go again with the tap. Paul Boyle reaches for the line but Leinster hold him up! Unreal defence by debutant Niall Smyth who had a tough first half! 48′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Harry West! What a score! Magic, magic, magic Connacht! The outstanding Sean Jansen and Finn Treacy combine and West collects the offload on the inside to score, pretty much under the sticks. Handbags afterwards and officials getting involved but the try will be good! Gilbert converts and Connacht lead! 51′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Sublime line-break by Fintan Gunne and he finds Snyman in support! The huge lock takes it close but Cian Prendergast wins the jackal penalty on the scramble and The Sportsground erupts again. What a piece of attack and defence by each side. This is cracker. 54′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster have a penalty advantage inside the Connacht half — and now a penalty as Sam Gilbert and co. stop James Lowe and Ciarán Frawley down Leinster’s left. There’ll be a Leinster lineout deep in Connacht territory shortly, but Rónan Kelleher is just getting a bit of treatment. He looks alright. 56′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Connacht defend their line! Sean Jansen — man of the match by a wide margin to this point — wallops Scott Penny in contact and forces another knock-on. Connacht will get the scrum on their own 5′. The Fields of Athenry reverberates around Dexcom once again. 57′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster win the scrum penalty on the Connacht 5′! 57′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! RG Snyman! The visitors tap and go and after a first effort by Charlie Tector, RG Snyman breaches the whitewash and dots down! Harry Byrne brings us level again. What a final quarter we have in store. 59′ – CON 20-20 LEIN: Leinster’s tempo is starting to give Connacht big problems. 60′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Charlie Tector! That’s inexcusable defence by Connacht, to be honest. Off first phase, Tector runs through Tierney-Martin and Aungier and goes right under the sticks from just outside the Connacht 22′. Leinster have turned this game on its head: they lead 27-20! 64′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Connacht win a scrum pen near halfway. Jack Carty gives them a lineout up towards the Leinster 22′. 66′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Another Connacht pen just outside the 22′ — Tector not rolling away — and Connacht take the three points. Gilbert brings the gap down to four as the rain begins to descend from the heavens over Galway again. 69′ – CON 23-27 LEIN: Nice grubber down the left by James Lowe and Leinster get a five-metre scrum after an error in judgement by Finn Treacy! The Connacht wing clips the ball with his instep ahead of the try-line and then dots it down. Leinster can kill it here. 70′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Ciarán Frawley against his future employers! That should do it! Leinster win a penalty advantage and eventually cross in the left-hand corner through the Connacht-bound Frawley, who just about gathers Harry Byrne’s delayed pass to score. Byrne converts from the left-hand touchline and Leinster lead by 11 with just under 10 minutes to go. That’s also the bonus point secured by Leinster. 72′ – CON 23-34 LEIN: Luke McGrath pins Connacht back with a beautiful box-kick over the top which rolls into touch near the Connacht 5′. Leinster have turned the screw here. That’ll do it: a special occasion for Connacht but they just about ran out of gas and, unfortunately for them, leave with nothing. Leinster take maximum points after another second-half surge against the Westerners, but that was a super game. Thanks for joining us. Keep an eye on The 42 for Murray Kinsella’s report and reaction.

Title: Aave Price Structure Hinges On Crucial $145 Level — Here’s How

As the crypto market suffered a widespread decline, Aave (AAVE) prices dipped by nearly 10%, reaching a local bottom around $153. Presently, the altcoin is trading within a range of $155-$160, but an emerging chart pattern indicates an impending price breakout. In an X post on January 23, popular market expert Ali Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AAVEUSD 4-hour chart, showing the altcoin is approaching a critical market juncture. Notably, a key support zone of $144 sits at the base of a broader descending structure that has defined AAVE’s price action since last year. Martinez’s analysis shows that AAVE is trading within a falling wedge formation, characterized by a series of lower highs capped by a descending trendline and relatively stable support near the $145 region. This price formation often represents a period of consolidation following sustained downside pressure, as sellers gradually lose momentum while buyers defend a key floor. For context, since topping out above the $350 level earlier in the cycle, AAVE has experienced a steady corrective move, with price stepping down through multiple horizontal levels near $240, $200, and $162. The loss of these zones shifted short-term momentum firmly in favor of sellers, making the current support range even more important. At present, AAVE is trading in the mid $150s, leaving limited room before a direct retest of the $144.93 support. However, this level has already acted as a demand zone multiple times during the current downtrend, reinforcing its significance. According to Martinez’s analysis, a clean break below $145 could force an accelerated downside move, with the next major support area set around $125. In that scenario, price acceptance below the wedge structure would likely confirm a continuation of the broader bearish trend. Conversely, holding the $145 support may provide the conditions for a technical rebound. A successful defense of this level, combined with a break above the descending trendline, could allow AAVE to reclaim higher resistance zones around $162 and potentially $200 over time. While such a move would not immediately invalidate the larger corrective structure, it would suggest improving market balance and decreased selling pressure. At press time, Aave trades at $156.99, reflecting a decline of 0.76% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is up by 6.07% and valued at $362.59 million. With price compressing toward the apex of the falling wedge, traders should expect increased volatility in the coming AAVE trading sessions. For now, the price moves at $144.93 as a pivotal inflection point for determining the next directional move.

Title: Brex and The Pros and Cons of Hubristic Fundraising

Time Published: 2026-01-24T15:18:47Z

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Fundraising Capital One just announced it’s acquiring Brex for $5.15 billion. An incredible, top 0.1% “exit” in less than 10 years from a category creator that created massive wealth and opportunities. A huge win. But also … less than half of Brex’s $12.3 billion valuation from October 2022. Should anyone care? Many are seeing is a failure vs Ramp, a measured success at best. But … why? I don’t think most people commenting on this actually understand what they’re reacting to. What they’re really feeling—even if they can’t articulate it—is the consequences of hubristic fundraising. And we should probably talk about it. Because hubristic fundraising is back. In a big way. It was back big time in 2025 and is back even bigger time in 2026. Let me define it simply: Hubristic fundraising is when you raise at a valuation so aggressive, with terms so favorable, with a narrative so bold, that you are essentially betting the entire future of your company on hitting an extraordinary outcome. It’s not just “raising a lot of money.” Plenty of companies raise hundreds of millions without hubris. Hubristic fundraising is when you: These deals can work out. It will work out for Databricks, Anthropic, etc. But at least as of when I write this, there are so very few $30B+ IPOs or exits. And that’s what Brex was promising. ElevenLabs, Harvey, Replit/Lovable, Cursor etc. are promising even more. Brex checked all these boxes. In 2021 and 2022, they raised at valuations that implied they would not just win corporate cards and expense management—they would dominate financial services for startups, then enterprises, then… everyone, apparently. Stupidest behavior I've seen on @brexHQ getting acquired by @CapitalOne for $5.15B: – Saying Brex "lost"– Mocking Brex for the outcome– Claiming investors lost money If losing means starting a business that gets sold for over $5B in 9 years, where both founders make hundreds… — JC Bahr-de Stefano (@jbahrdestefano) January 23, 2026 Let’s remember what 2021 looked like. Zero interest rates. SPACs everywhere. Tiger Global doing deals in 48 hours. Multiples that would make a 1999 VC blush. Brex raised $300 million at a $12.3 billion valuation in October 2022—technically 2022, but really the tail end of the 2021 madness before rates spiked and everything crashed. At that valuation, with maybe $200-250M in revenue at the time, Brex was being valued at 50x+ revenue. For a low gross margin corporate card and expense management company. In a market with Ramp, Mercury, Airbase, Navan, and others all competing furiously. Was that valuation justified by fundamentals? No. Was it justified by the fundraising environment and competitive dynamics of the moment? Absolutely. And that’s the trap of hubristic fundraising. In the moment, it feels not just rational but necessary. Hubristic fundraising works. At least for a while. And sometimes forever. When you’re the $12 billion company and your competitor is the $3 billion company, who do the Stanford MBAs and Google PMs want to join? The big number wins. The paper gains look better. The press coverage is better. The LinkedIn flex is better. Brex recruited absolute killers in 2021-2022. Engineers from Stripe. Execs from everywhere. One of the best sales teams ever under Sam Blond. That was partly product and vision—but it was also the massive valuation signaling “this is the winner.” This one is circular but real. Raise at a huge valuation, and suddenly more investors want in. FOMO is the most powerful force in venture capital. The $12.3B valuation wasn’t a barrier to raising more—it was a magnet for investors who wanted to be part of “the next big thing.” Enterprise customers want to work with winners. When Brex was valued at $12B and their competitor was valued at $2B, which one do more conservative customers feel comfortable signing a multi-year deal with? The big number creates legitimacy. It signals staying power. Every funding round becomes news. Every executive hire becomes news. You’re always in the conversation. That awareness compounds. When you’re raising at $12B and your competitor just raised at $1.5B, you are sending a message: we are going to outspend you on everything. Sales. Marketing. R&D. Acquisitions. Some competitors will give up. Others will make mistakes trying to keep up. Ramp didn’t give up. But many others did. Now for the dark side. This is the big one. And it’s what I think people are actually reacting to with Brex without realizing it. When you raise at a hubristic valuation, you attract employees, investors, and partners who are there for the outcome, not the mission. They’re there because they did the math on their equity and saw an IPO at $25B+ and early retirement. That’s fine when everything is going up and to the right. But the moment you hit turbulence—and every company hits turbulence—those mercenaries disappear. They have no patience for struggle. They didn’t sign up for hard mode. They signed up for paper gains. Brex went through brutal layoffs in 2024. Lost 20% of the company. Massive executive turnover. Struggled with burn. Had to do a full “Brex 3.0” turnaround that CEO Pedro Franceschi admirably pulled off. But where were the fans during that turnaround? Where were all the people celebrating Brex’s dominance in 2021? Gone. Because they were never fans. They were mercenaries betting on an outcome, not a company. Brex just sold for $5.15 billion. In cash and stock. To a major bank. Creating liquidity for everyone. Is that a failure? We’re already seeing this play out in real-time in AI. Look at Windsurf. Windsurf (formerly Codeium) was one of the hottest AI coding startups. They had $82 million in ARR with enterprise revenue doubling quarterly. OpenAI offered $3 billion to acquire them. When that deal fell apart, Google paid $2.4 billion in a reverse acqui-hire for the CEO, co-founder, and 40 senior staff. Cognition then scooped up the remaining assets—the product, IP, 210 employees, and the entire $82M ARR business—for a reported $250 million. Total value captured: roughly $2.65 billion. And yet? The narrative in Silicon Valley was that Windsurf “sold too cheap.” SaaStr literally published “Did Windsurf Sell Too Cheap?” The deal was framed as a cautionary tale, a fire sale, a disappointment. Think about that. A company with $82 million ARR that didn’t exist three years ago returned $2.65 billion to stakeholders. In any other era, that’s a legendary outcome. But when Cursor is valued at $29.3 billion? When Lovable hits $6.6 billion with $200 million ARR? Suddenly $2.65 billion for $82 million ARR feels like leaving money on the table. That’s hubristic fundraising distorting reality. The benchmarks have become so warped that even massive wins feel like losses. For Ribbit Capital, who led the Series A, this is a monster return. For employees who joined early, this is life-changing money. For the customers using the product, nothing changes except they get the backing of a major financial institution. But because the peak valuation was $12.3B, the narrative is “Brex failed.” They got acquired at a “steep discount.” They “crashed.” This is insane. A $5B+ exit is an incredible outcome for any company. But hubristic fundraising creates hubristic expectations. And anything short of those expectations feels like failure—even when it objectively isn’t. When you’ve raised at $12B, you can’t think about $5B exits. You can’t consider acqui-hires or smaller strategic deals. Every decision has to be oriented around justifying that massive valuation. This leads to over-expansion, over-hiring, and over-spending. Brex’s $17 million/month burn in Q4 2023 was a direct consequence of trying to grow into a $12B valuation. For Brex to have “succeeded” by the mercenary definition, they probably needed to IPO at $20B+ or get acquired for $15B+. In the fintech market of 2023-2025. With rising rates. With competitors like Ramp breathing down their neck. That’s an almost impossible bar. And when you don’t clear it, everyone who joined for the outcome—and only the outcome—writes you off. Here’s the thing that should concern everyone: we’re doing this again. And in the Age of AI, we’re doing it at a scale that makes 2021 look quaint. Look at Ramp. In 2025 alone, they went from $13B to $16B to $22.5B to $32B. Four funding rounds in one year. Nearly tripling their valuation in twelve months. Is Ramp a great company? Of course. They hit $1B+ in ARR in record time. They’re cash flow positive. They’ve executed brilliantly. But four rounds in one year? A $32B valuation for an expense management company? This is 2021 fundraising playbook all over again. Except now, in AI, it’s 2021 on steroids. Let me share some numbers that should make your head spin. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion in a seed round. Not Series A. Not Series B. A seed round. At a $12 billion valuation. Before shipping a product. The former OpenAI CTO walks out the door and six months later has a company valued higher than Brex just sold for. And it gets crazier. Bloomberg reported Thinking Machines is now in discussions to raise additional funding at a $50 billion valuation. Even with their CTO having just quit with several other top team members to go back to OpenAI. That would be a 4x markup in less than a year. For a company that just launched its first product in October. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised over $1 billion for his AI safety startup. The former OpenAI Chief Scientist hasn’t shipped anything public yet. But billions? Sure, here you go. Harvey, the legal AI company, went from $3B to $5B to $8B across three funding rounds in 2025 alone. They raised $760 million in a single year. They 2.7x’d their valuation in ten months. For an AI tool that helps lawyers do due diligence faster. ElevenLabs went from $1.1B (January 2024) to $3.3B (January 2025) to $6.6B (September 2025). That’s 6x in less than two years. A voice synthesis company is now worth more than Brex sold for. Lovable, the Swedish “vibe coding” startup, went from $1.8B in July to $6.6B in December. They 3.5x’d in five months. They’re barely a year old. Cursor went from under $10B to $29.3B in a single year. They raised $2.3B in their Series D. That’s not a funding round—that’s an entire unicorn in a single check. We are now regularly seeing what would have been considered absurd even in 2021: billion-dollar seed rounds, valuations that exceed Brex’s exit for companies that haven’t shipped products, and 3-4x markups in less than a year. Is this driven by real innovation? In many cases, yes. AI is genuinely transformative. Is this also hubristic? Also yes. The same dynamics apply, just amplified. These valuations require these companies to not just succeed but to dominate. They require AI to transform every industry exactly as promised, on exactly the timeline investors are betting on. They require no major regulatory setbacks, no compute shortages, no technical plateaus. And they’re attracting the same mercenaries—talent, capital, and partners who are there for the paper gains, not the mission. Some of these companies will hit their numbers and the valuations will prove justified. ElevenLabs has real revenue. Harvey has real customers. Cursor has $1B ARR. The AI revolution is real. But many won’t hit their numbers. And when they don’t—when the inevitable correction comes—we’ll see the same pattern: mercenaries leaving, narratives turning, “failures” that are actually $3-5B exits, founders blamed for outcomes that were structurally locked in the moment they took hubristic valuations. The difference this time? The numbers are bigger. The falls will be harder. And the schadenfreude will be even more intense. When Thinking Machines is worth $50B and comes up short of expectations, no one will remember that Mira Murati built something real. They’ll call it a failure because it wasn’t worth $100B. When Harvey can’t grow into an $8B valuation fast enough, no one will remember they serve half of the top law firms in America. They’ll say legal AI was overhyped. That’s how hubristic fundraising works. The mercenaries don’t remember the mission. They only remember the paper. For many founders, especially in AI, hubristic fundraising isn’t really a choice. It’s a survival imperative at the very top. The war for AI talent is unlike anything we’ve seen before. Meta is offering $1 billion+ packages to poach researchers. OpenAI is clawing back co-founders from startups that raised $2 billion seed rounds. Google paid $2.4 billion just to acqui-hire 40 people from Windsurf. If you’re an AI founder and you don’t raise at an aggressive valuation, what happens? Your competitor raises at $10B. They can now offer engineers equity packages worth $50M on paper. Your $2B valuation offers $10M packages. You lose the talent war before it starts. Your competitor has $500M in the bank to buy GPUs. You have $50M. You can’t train competitive models. You fall behind on capabilities. Your competitor’s valuation signals “winner” to enterprise customers. Your valuation signals “risky bet.” You lose deals to perception, not product. In many cases, it might be almost irresponsible not to take the hubristic path. The founders who stayed disciplined, who raised at “reasonable” valuations, who prioritized sustainable growth—many of them got steamrolled by competitors who didn’t. So I’m not here to tell founders to avoid hubristic fundraising. In the current AI environment, that might be asking them to bring a knife to a gunfight. Hubristic fundraising narrows your exit options. Not always financially—Brex proved you can still do a “down exit” and create real liquidity. But it narrows what success means for your stakeholders, your employees, your company narrative, and frankly, for your own psychology. When you raise at $12B, a $5B exit isn’t a win. It’s a disappointment. When you raise at $29B, anything less than a $50B+ IPO feels like failure. When your employees joined expecting a $100B outcome, a $10B exit means they’re doing mental math on what could have been. The mercenaries don’t just leave when things go badly. They leave when things go less well than the paper said they would. You can raise hubristically and still build a great company. Brex did. But you need to go in with eyes open about who you’re attracting, what expectations you’re setting, and how the narrative will be written if you come up even a little short. Because the siren call is seductive. The capital, the talent, the press, the gravity—it all feels like winning. And sometimes it is winning. But sometimes it’s just setting yourself up for a “failure” that would have been a triumph at any other valuation. Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras built something real. They went from Stanford dropouts to a $5B+ exit in under 8 years. They served thousands of companies, moved billions of dollars, and built technology that Capital One clearly values. The “failure” narrative says more about our broken expectations than about Brex. But there is a lesson here for founders considering hubristic fundraising—especially the AI founders raising at $10B, $20B, $50B valuations right now: Know who you’re attracting. The capital, talent, and attention that comes with a huge valuation comes with strings attached. Those strings are expectations. And when expectations get too disconnected from reality, you’ll eventually find yourself surrounded by people who were only ever there for the paper. Missionaries stay through the turnaround. Mercenaries don’t. Brex survived their turnaround and found a soft landing. Many companies in the next few years won’t be so fortunate. The question for every founder raising in this frothy AI market—whether you’re building fintech or AI B2B or foundation models—is simple: are you building a company or a casino bet? Are you really, honestly building a $100B generational company? And who exactly is sitting at your table? Because when the cards turn—and they always turn—you’ll find out fast who was really on your team. Just ask Brex. They built a real company, executed a real turnaround, and achieved a real exit. And half the internet is calling it a failure because the number wasn’t big enough. That’s the price of hubristic fundraising. Powerful? Yes. Dangerous? Also yes. Choose your investors, your employees, and your expectations wisely. The mercenaries won’t be there when you need them most.

Title: A Ghost is Haunting Davos! The WEF Summit
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/ghost-haunting-davos/5913196
Time Published: 2026-01-24T12:52:19Z

The 2026 Davos Summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) will undoubtedly go down in history. Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of the First Cold War with the victory of the United States, I believe the Davos Summit, which began on Monday, is declaring the end of American hegemony. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. The World Economic Forum shouldn’t be taken lightly. Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a student of Kissinger who was a former lawyer for Rockefeller, this foundation has been renowned for shaping the course of the capitalist world for 50 years. Note: The WEF’s founding date coincides with the year the US dollar was removed from the gold standard. Image: Brende in 2023 (Public Domain) At this year’s summit, Borge Brende, a low-profile Norwegian right-wing politician who has taken over the seat of the now-retired Klaus Schwab, is attempting to keep the foundation afloat; Even if he says, “The World Economic Forum isn’t about responding to current events. It’s about orchestrating the right conditions to move forward,” it’s all in vain. There’s great chaos at the top level. The culprit is Emperor Trump, who, like a bull in a china shop, is destroying everything in the Western establishment. Trump is actually feigning madness, but he knows perfectly well that his country is in a terrible situation. Its total debt has reached $40 trillion, and for the first time in history, its annual interest payments exceed its military spending by one trillion dollars. To address this, Trump has increased the Pentagon budget to $1.5 trillion by 2026. What Trump is doing, continuing with “Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Greenland, Canada,” is like a powerful opponent overturning the table after losing the game. In my opinion, Trump is playing the role of a madman to prevent the inevitable collapse of the US. He probably doesn’t need to act that much, given his nature. As the spoiled and useless child of a wealthy contractor whose father was a Jewish lobbyist, nonsense and perversion are in his blood. But the bitter truth is emerging at the annual meeting of finance capital in Davos. The Western world is accepting defeat. For example, what did Larry Fink, the famous CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, say? “Global elites have lost the public’s trust and are currently facing ‘deep institutional distrust.’ If the WEF wants to be useful in the future, it must regain that trust.” Fink is referring to the Plandemic and the Great Reset scenarios. And of course, he’s describing the horrific income inequality in the world and the savagery of neoliberalism, or finance capital, that ran rampant after 1980. He’s practically confessing the sins of capitalism’s as a grey cardinal! “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the greatest wealth in history has been created, but this money has gone into the pockets of a tiny minority, enough to disrupt social peace. No society can sustain such an unjust distribution for long; eventually, the system will crack.” The End of White-Collar Workers: “Just as globalization hit the factory worker, Artificial Intelligence will now do the same to office workers, lawyers, and analysts. I’m not talking about the future, I’m talking about today!” You’d think he was about to sing the international anthem! But Fink, burning with rage as gold, silver, and copper soared while stock markets and the dollar crashed, wasn’t alone. The announcement of the collapse of the West’s “rules-based order” was made by the US’s immediate neighbor. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a speech that was at least as important, perhaps even more so, than Fink’s: “We knew the narrative of a rules-based international order was a lie. We knew that the most powerful actors would exempt themselves when it suited them. But this construct was convenient.” Carney also admitted that he had accepted American hegemony because it suited the purposes of his government. But now the system had broken down. The former central banker-turned-prime minister alluded to Vaclav Havel’s famous story of the greengrocer. In the story, a greengrocer in the Soviet Union hangs a sign in his shop that reads “Workers of the world unite,” even though he doesn’t believe it. But one day he decides not to conform and takes it down; this spreads, and communism collapses! “This fiction was useful. That’s why we put the sign up in the window. We are not in a transition period, but in the midst of a rupture. We are aware of what is happening and we are determined to act accordingly. We know that a rupture requires more than just conformity. It requires honestly accepting the world as it is. We are taking the sign down.” This was a response to Trump’s “initiation of illegality” and the very announcement of the specter haunting Davos: the collective acceptance by the West of the end of US hegemony. Like Fink and Carney, Belgian Prime Minister (right wing-conservative) Bart De Wever stated: “On Wednesday, together with King Philippe of Belgium, we will meet with Trump. But this will have a different character than we planned. The message we will probably have to give is: You are crossing red lines here. Either we stand together or we are divided; if we are divided, it will be the end of 80 years of Atlanticism, a real era will close. And you know, as Gramsci said: “While the old is dying, the new is not yet born, now is the time of monsters. It is up to him (Trump) to decide whether he will be a monster or not, yes or no?” The Italian communist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, like the famous Czech anti-communist Vaclav Havel, was declaring the end of the Second Cold War and the defeat of the US long after his death (through the mouths of the most ardent capitalists). While all this was happening, the EU announced it was canceling its trade agreement with the US. The US was offering Denmark $700 billion to buy Greenland (including a one-time payment of one million dollars to each Greenland citizen to accept US citizenship), and Iran was preparing for what was likely an imminent US-Israeli attack. At Davos, the club of the wealthy where the future of the world and capitalism was discussed, the familiar rhetoric of global warming was also shelved. In fact, it would become clear at this summit that the chemicals sprayed into the air under the pretext of global warming were not a conspiracy theory. Journalist James O’Keefe secretly filmed at the World Economic Forum, recording elites confessing to things long dismissed as “conspiracy theories.” World Economic Forum in casual conversations with O’Keefe, the elite openly admitted that chemicals were being sprayed into the atmosphere and even agricultural areas to cool the planet. One company executive acknowledged that many of these operations were being carried out quietly and behind closed doors by the US military; “A large part of the work is actually done by the (US) military. They do it constantly, and it’s actually quite cheap.” Those lines we saw in the sky were indeed chemicals dropped from planes! In short, the end of Pax Americana was announced in Davos, and the ghost of reality began to howl in the Swiss Alps. The panic among the bosses shows that the world has now reached a turning point. Whether good or bad… Note: Meanwhile, China and Russia seem to be enjoying the taste of winning without doing much. What the Chinese delegation said in Davos suggests that Western leaders (like Mark Carney) will soon be heading to China. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said in Davos: “The world cannot return to the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak.” “China is ready to be not only the world’s factory, but also the world’s market,” he said. However, when Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, there was no one to greet him. There was no official welcome. No delegation was present. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: How Jane Fraser's 'star recruits' are helping Citi push ahead

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Citi has largely put the dog days of its multiyear transformation behind it, and CEO Jane Fraser signaled a shift from remediation to competition. The next step is cultural. In a memo to employees last week, Fraser told Citi's more than 200,000 workers that "the bar is raised" and that it was time to ditch bad habits. When Fraser took over as Citi's chief executive in 2021, the bank was under intense scrutiny — bogged down by regulatory pressure, dated and weak technology, and investor doubts about whether it could still compete with Wall Street's most established names. Five years in, the stock is up about 40% over the past year and more than 80% over the past five — signs that investors are increasingly confident the firm has moved past its worst problems. Central to the bank's efforts are three executives she hired to run businesses that are key to Citi's growth: investment banking, wealth management, and technology. Brian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, offered a sports analogy. "If Jane Fraser is the quarterback, you need really strong skill positions — the receivers and running backs — to carry the ball over the goal line. These are the five-star recruits you'd want on that team," he told Business Insider. "They're now on offense." Corporate dealmaker Viswas Raghavan has earned an industry reputation for pushing his people. Andy Sieg is the politically savvy denizen of the white-glove world of money management. And Tim Ryan is the steady hand from consulting, tasked with reinventing the bank's technology backbone. Their rise has fueled some quiet succession chatter, though Fraser has given no indication she is considering stepping aside anytime soon. As her no-nonsense year takes shape, here is how those three executives have fared in reshaping their units and how they're helping enforce her mandate. Title: Executive Vice Chairman and Head of Banking Since Viswas "Vis" Raghavan took over Citi's investment banking business in June 2024, the unit is showing clear signs of momentum. Investment banking fees rose 35% year over year in 2025, with M&A revenues jumping 84%, according to Citi's fourth-quarter results. Fraser highlighted some of the bank's most prominent client wins during the earnings call, including mandate work for Boeing, Pfizer, Nippon Steel, Johnson & Johnson, and private-equity firms Blackstone and TPG. Last year, Citi advised on Nippon Steel's roughly $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, and on Charter Communications' announced nearly $35 billion combination with Cox Communications. As head of banking, he oversees investment banking, corporate banking, and commercial banking — a sprawling remit that puts him at the vanguard of many of Citi's most financially important relationships. Raghavan is known in the industry for his high expectations. A 25-year JPMorgan veteran, Raghavan ran the firm's league table-topping investment banking franchise and oversaw its business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Landing Raghavan's star power was a boon for Citi, Mulberry said. "It absolutely matters who is backing the deal. Having that specific hire, with the confidence he brings" in the eyes of the kinds of clients Citi wants, is a triumph for the bank, he added. His credibility has helped him rebuild Citi's senior dealmaking ranks from rivals — especially JPMorgan. He's lured JPMorgan bankers Drago Rajkovic and Guillermo Baygual to serve as global co-heads of M&A at Citi. Former Goldman Sachs partner David Friedland joined Citi last summer as co-head of North America investment banking. And the Wall Street Journal reported this week that former JPMorgan banker Alex Berkett, an ex-Paramount executive, would join to build Citi's media business. Title: Head of Wealth In a note sent to employees of his division following earnings results last week, Andy Sieg said key focuses for the division would include leading the way in wealth advisory, deepening the integration of wealth offerings through the US retail bank, and incorporating AI into regular, daily workflows. He shared a chart showing Citi Wealth revenue up 22% in two years. And he doubled down on Fraser's empathic message. "For 2026, the bar has been raised," he wrote in the memo, which was viewed by Business Insider and confirmed by a Citi spokesperson. "Jane speaks of scale for the bank; it will be our watchword as well. Strong, sustained organic growth will be ours if we double down on a set of strategic priorities," including fomenting "a culture of ownership, accountability, and innovation," he added. Sieg joined Citi in late 2023 to fix its wealth business. Sieg previously oversaw roughly 25,000 employees at Bank of America, where he had risen to the role of president of Merrill Wealth Management. The bank said wealth revenue grew 14% in 2025, according to fourth-quarter earnings. Mulberry said Citi could rebuild wealth gradually over time, but argued that Sieg's background speeds things up. "I think on the wealth management side, there's a fair argument you could do that organically," he said, "but it helps to have a weighty name that's been successful in gathering assets at a place like Merrill Lynch." Sieg has moved away from the single global private-bank head structure and made targeted hires, including former BlackRock portfolio manager Kate Moore to run the chief investment office and ex-Morgan Stanley executive Dawn Nordberg to deepen ties between wealth and banking. Citi has also added senior private bankers like Clinton Warren, a former JPMorgan private banker, to lead teams in the central US. He has also had notable exits, including longtime private bank chief Ida Liu, who left in early 2025; and Valentín Valderrábano, chief operating officer for global wealth, whose exit was announced this month. He is following Liu to her new employer, HSBC. It's also been reported that Sieg was the subject of an internal investigation into his conduct. A Financial Times report from October raised some questions about how the probe was conducted, but Citi told the FT that it approaches "all internal complaints appropriately by conducting unbiased, thorough, and complete investigations", and noted a "commitment to a workplace where everyone is treated fairly and has equal opportunity to succeed." Title: Head of Technology and Business Enablement Citi is pushing deep into artificial intelligence as it moves out of its long-running cleanup phase. More than 80% of Citi's transformation programs are now at or close to their target state, Fraser said on the latest earnings call. That progress has enabled the bank to shift its focus toward growth and innovation. That next phase is being largely driven by Tim Ryan, who joined Citigroup in 2024 after spending nearly two decades at PwC, most recently as the consulting firm's US chair. Fraser tapped him to run technology and business enablement as Citi worked to move past years repairing outdated systems and addressing regulatory shortcomings. Early on, he was tasked with turning around Citi's substandard data management systems. Last summer, he was named one of the senior executives overseeing Citi's AI strategy. Citi has begun embedding artificial intelligence into core processes across the firm — from know-your-customer reviews to loan underwriting — starting with more than 50 of its largest and most complex workflows. Employees in 84 countries have already used the bank's proprietary AI tools tens of millions of times with adoption exceeding 70% across the workflow. According to the bank's third-quarter earnings report last year, Citi used generative AI to conduct one million automated code reviews, saving approximately 100,000 hours per week across its developer population. In the fall, Ryan wrote on LinkedIn that Citi had rolled out prompt training to help workers get more out of the tech, and cheered the bank's plans to rev the engine on agentic AI. But competition is rife. The broader finance industry is being rapidly reshaped by AI, with powerhouse firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan spending billions to supercharge their workforces. The fight to secure top AI talent has intensified. Citi has spent years defined by baggage from its past that it's been under pressure to fix. Now, it has the rare chance to define what it wants to be. Fraser wants her staff to know there's no time to lose. She concluded her memo with a clear directive: "Let's get it done." Jump to

January 24, 2026 6:55am by Barry Ritholtz The weekend is here! Pour yourself a mug of Danish Blend coffee, grab a seat outside, and get ready for our longer-form weekend reads: • Netflix’s $82.7 billion rags-to-riches story: How the DVD-by-mail company swallowed Hollywood. It’s a story so good it could have been a screenplay. In 2000, Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph sat down across from John Antioco, then CEO of video rental giant Blockbuster, and pitched him on acquiring their still unprofitable DVD-by-mail startup, Netflix, which at the time had around 300,000 subscribers. But when they told him their price—$50 million and the chance to develop and run Blockbuster’s online rental business—Antioco balked. By 2010, Blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy, and Netflix had stormed Hollywood with its entertainment streaming service. (Fortune) • Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and the Reading Unlock: One Buffett lesson I’ll share with my kid: read, read, read. (SatPost by Trung Phan) • The Multidisciplinary Approach to Thinking. Using a true multidisciplinary understanding of things, Peter identifies two often overlooked, parabolic “Big Ideas”: 1) Mirrored Reciprocation (go positive and go first) and 2) Compound Interest (being constant). A great “Life Hack” is to simply combine these two into one basic approach to living your life: “Go positive and go first, and be constant in doing it.” (Farnam Street) • The Crisis Whisperer: how Adam Tooze makes sense of our bewildering age: Whether it’s the financial crash, the climate emergency or the breakdown of the international order, historian Adam Tooze has become the go-to guide to the radical new world we’ve entered. (The Guardian) • The Shape of Time: In the 19th century, the linear idea of time became dominant, forever changing how those in the West experience the world. (Aeon) • GLP-1s And Your Brain: The Surprising Impact On Addiction, Anxiety, ADHD, And More: What started out as a medication for diabetes and weight loss is offering something unexpected—and completely life-changing—for many women. (Womens Health) • The Education of the Broligarchy: The same sources that inspired tech moguls to bend matter, minds, and markets to their will may also help explain their foray into other forms of power (Colossus) • Can Congress Still Check the Commander in Chief? Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, discusses Venezuela, NATO and the limits of congressional power as global crises multiply. (Bloomberg) • An exclusive look inside the largest effort ever mounted to keep the Great Barrier Reef alive: Australia is doing absolutely everything to protect its most iconic ecosystem — except, perhaps, the one thing that really matters. (Vox) • Mike Macdonald is a genius, but that’s not the only reason his Seahawks are Super Bowl favorites: The Seahawks are arguably the best team in football because they have elite talent. But everyone in the NFL has talent, especially in the postseason. Marrying that talent with the vision and bringing it to life, Macdonald believes, starts with intent and attitude. That’s their foundation for getting players to play fast and free.

Title: Take a look at the fanciest private jets and government aircraft that took the rich and powerful to Davos

Every time Pete publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. That meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too. Business Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week. On Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents. The majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF. Others landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance. From Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft. On Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s. Throughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase. Gulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views. Business jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower. It's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats. These are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million. Flight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday. Some governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands. Due to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft. Sometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too. Business Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers. The first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one. A handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer. It's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet. According to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail. Flight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday. JetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma. This is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Emmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris. However, it appears he left before Trump's speech. Even the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. "Those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said. "What the hell happened?" Macron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem. A Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed. It costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter. More popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet. Trump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner. However, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it. This week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One. His press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force. The Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year. He flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday. Carney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," he said. The above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday. The Argentine government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," arrived in Zurich on Tuesday. Flight-tracking data showed it departed Buenos Aires on Monday evening, then stopped in the Canary Islands, before heading to Switzerland. The journey took about 15 hours. Jump to

Title: I was laid off from CrowdStrike and used AI to send 800 applications in a month to land my ideal role

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike. I went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon. That's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff. I was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a "great résumé."

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Little did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit. In the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it. At first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked. Instead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called "The Reboot Era," where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences. Even with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, "Should I update my résumé for this role?" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls. LinkedIn "Easy Apply" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked. At first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house. A week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me. Over the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters. With AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast. In total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer. That's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase. AI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person. I think the job market is going in the wrong direction. First, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand. If the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions. None of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back. Jump to

Title: Ethereum Outlook Splits Wall Street as BlackRock Bets on Tokenization While JPMorgan Remains Cautious
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-outlook-splits-wall-street-as-blackrock-bets-on-tokenization-while-jpmorgan-remains-cautious/
Time Published: 2026-01-24T08:11:58Z

Ethereum’s 2026 outlook appears to have split Wall Street giants BlackRock and JPMorgan. While the $14 trillion asset manager BlackRock notes that tokenization might benefit the network, JPMorgan notes that Ethereum is still not out of the woods yet. The diverging opinions come amid a surge in network activity, despite the ETH price stalling amid a bearish trend across the broader market. Earlier this week, BlackRock stated that Ethereum is set to dominate the tokenization industry. The asset manager noted that the network could emerge as the gateway for traditional companies looking to dip their toes into blockchain. According to the head of equity ETFs at the asset management firm, Jay Jacobs, if the number of firms using the Ethereum network to tokenize real-world assets increases, ETH could be on a bullish trajectory. BlackRock also notes that as demand for tokenization increases, trading activity on the network will increase, and so will the issuance of various assets, such as stablecoins. The report comes nearly two years after the asset manager launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The fund currently has a stablecoin market cap of more than $221 billion. Despite BlackRock’s bullish take, the firm’s iShares Ethereum Trust has been bleeding for the last three consecutive days. During this time, the ETF has seen more than $387 million in outflows, a trend that has coincided with a nearly 12% drop in ETH prices over the last week. JPMorgan has taken a cautious outlook on Ethereum, saying that the recent uptick in network activity might not be sustained. According to the banking giant, the factors that previously hampered network usage might still be at play, which could trigger a bearish correction in the future. Analysts at the bank added that the recent surge in activity might be due to the Fusaka upgrade that went live towards the end of 2025. However, historical data shows that these upgrades only improve network activity for a short time before stalling. JPMorgan also notes that user migration from the mainnet to layer two networks could stall activity, making it challenging for the ETH price to sustain an upward trajectory.

Title: AIL preview: Young Munster look to break top-five at home to Terenure

The top five teams in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League have opened up a 10-point gap to the bottom four, adding significant to the clash between Young Munster (28 points) in sixth and third-placed Terenure (32) at Tom Clifford Park, where the visitors last won in 2017. What’s more, Munsters are seeking a second consecutive double over Terenure after a 29-19 win at Lakelands Park in early December. Despite winning just one of their first six matches, it was clear the Cookies’ results were misleading, picking up seven bonus points in those first four defeats. But that win over Terenure sparked a maximum haul of 15 points from their last three games, and this weekend make just two changes to the side that won at Nenagh last time out. Munster and former Connacht and Ireland Sevens winger Andrew Smith returns while Leo Langbridge starts in the backrow. Terenure make one change to the team that ended a three-game losing streak at home to Old Belvedere a fortnight ago, Leinster hooker John McKee returning to the fold as Max Russell reverts to openside after playing for Leinster A in Toulouse last weekend while Ben Blaney is on duty with the Ireland Under-20s. The rest of the top five teams will be favourites to win, although the same was true in early December when UCD produced their best performance of the season to beat Lansdowne 43-38. The students’ make two changes for the return meeting in Belfield, Leinster academy and Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam winner James Culhane coming in at number eight and Thomas Quinn at scrumhalf. Lansdowne make four changes; Harry O’Riordan at inside centre, Jack Matthews and Stephen Madigan in the halfback line, and Harry van Eeden at eight. Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley is also among the replacements after a length injury lay-off. Leaders Clontarf (42 points), seeking a 10th successive win, are unchanged at home to Nenagh, who have lost all 10 games this season, while second-placed St Marys (37) make just one change for the visit of seventh-place Ballynahinch (21). Cork Con (fourth, 32) take their four-game winning run to Old Belvedere for a first meeting at Ollie Campbell Park since 2016. The 1B leaders Old Wesley go to Queens, while the 2A and 2B unbeaten duo of MU Barnhall and Galwegians continue their push for promotion at home to Greystones and Navan respectively. Division 1A: Clontarf v Nenagh Ormond, Castle Avenue; Old Belvedere v Cork Constitution, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Lansdowne, Belfield; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Lakelands Park (3pm).

Title: Gonna be golden: join the flight to gold and other precious metals
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2026/01/24/gonna-be-golden-join-the-flight-to-gold-and-other-precious-metals/

Amid persistent geopolitical tensions rise in various parts of the world, precious metals such as gold and silver continue to see strong price growth. “The price of silver and gold has risen greatly in the past 60 days, mainly due to what’s going on in the world, from Greenland to the Middle East to Ukraine,” says John Weldon of Weldon Auctioneers in Cows Lane, Temple Bar, Dublin. Earlier this week, pure silver ingot was on the market for about €2.60 per gramme, compared with €1.39 per gramme in mid-November 2025. “People and banks move cash funds into the safety of silver and gold, not only to guard as an inflation hedge, but also to have a tangible asset,” Weldon says. John Weldon Auctioneers will be selling a commemorative set of silver ingots celebrating 1,000 years of the British monarchy from AD 973 to 1973, at their next auction on Tuesday, January 27th, at 2pm. Weldon says potential purchasers of this walnut-cased set of 50 silver ingots (each of which has a portrait and scene of a British monarch), will be more interested in the gramme weight of the silver rather than the historic significance of the item. The combined weight of the collection is about 3,300g. Although one would imagine that such a collection would sell better in the UK than in Ireland, Weldon says Irish owners have found that post-Brexit import duties have made it much less attractive for Irish owners to sell items of significant historic British interest there. The 1973 limited edition set made by John Pinches in London has an estimate of €5,000-€8,000, with the upper figure representing a little under the market price for silver (which stood at €2.57 per gramme earlier this week). Weldon says gold sovereign coins are another way of storing value. The auction includes three gold sovereign coins with guides of €700-€800 each, and a Canadian silver coin dated 2018 with a guide price of €400-€700. If predictions about people spending less time on their smartphones comes to pass, older-style time pieces such as alarm clocks and watches may well come back into vogue. Watches feature prominently in both Adams Blackrock online auction on January 28th at 7pm, and the aforementioned John Weldon in-person and live online auction on January 27th at 2pm. Elena McCrory of Adams Blackrock says Omega, Rolex, Patek Philippe, Longines and Raymond Weil watches are always in demand. A Rolex GMT-Master II Oyster-Perpetual Date man’s stainless steel wristwatch (€8,000-€9,000), and a Rolex Oyster 18-carat yellow gold diamond woman’s wristwatch (€6,000-€7,000) are included in the auction. Meanwhile, an 18-carat gold Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a white face and roman numeral dial (€9,500-€11,500) and an 18-carat Cartier Tank Française Chronograph wristwatch (€5,000-€6,000) are among the watches for sale at Weldon’s auction. The latter includes three sub-dials that track seconds, minutes and hours for anyone in need of such exact measurements for sporting or other pursuits. The Weldon auction also has a stainless steel Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a guide price of €3,000-€4,000. Most guide prices for watches at auction are substantially below the retail price of an equivalent watch. Moving on to matters much more mechanical, Wilsons Auctions in Belfast is holding a timed online auction of vintage tractors from Wednesday, January 28th, at 2pm, to Friday, January 30th. Collected over 60 years by Ronnie Deering of Newtownards, Co Down, the John Deere, Case, Chamberlin and Hanomag tractors date from 1918 to 1969 and were sourced in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. David Deering, son of Ronnie and Margaret Deering (who also ran Ballycastle House B&B for a number of years), has fond memories of participating in road runs, agricultural shows and vintage tractor shows over the years. Mount Stewart and Rosemount Estate in Greyabbey, Co Down, and Shane’s Castle, Co Antrim, were among the most popular local venues for such events. At least two of the Deering tractors for sale – a 1922 Case 12/20 Crossmotor tractor and a 1949 Chamberlin tractor – that were used in the Cooley Vintage Festival in 2007. At that event, more than 4,500 tractors helped set the Guinness World Record for the most veteran tractors ploughing simultaneously. Ronnie Deering, who worked for the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, bought some of his collection in Western Australia when visiting family there. Now in his 80s, he is ready to sell 12 of them, while the family retains eight or nine others, alongside vintage cars for future generations of the Deering family. “Myself and my father have restored many of these tractors over the years and we built an insulated shed to store them,” says David Deering, who expects strong interest in the vintage tractors from collectors here as well as abroad. Viewing takes place at the Deering residence (BT222AL) on Monday, January 26th, 10am-5pm. jwa.ie, adamsblackrock.ie, wilsonsauctions.com Estimate €500-€800 Hammer price €3,000 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €800-€1,200 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €400-€600 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €600-€1,000 Hammer price €1,800 Auction house Adam’s Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Only select stores though OP might need that in title. 1 out of 6 stores around me has it and that doesn't allow pick up so no deal for me Rooster Rolls are absolutely top tier fast food. Real chicken, not tenders. Two of them would hit the spot All I buy there, ..Just wish they didn't microwave the f out of em. I'm a 8 beers and 0.25 vodka atm and the rooster roll is one of gods greatest creations Haha, had just ordered 4 rooster rolls, 2 for dinner, and 2 for lunch at work tomorrow. Truly the best. After i placed the first order, i was unable to get the same deal again? How were you able to place 2 orders for the same deal? I really like the pineapple fritters and colesaw also This comes and goes often, but gosh it’s terrible food. Soggy rolls with some blender chicken. The two posts above literally could not be any different if they tried. My personal opinion red rooster has better quality than the beef burger fast food joints trying their hands on chicken as well as better quality than kfc 100%. KFC at it's best is superb, but I don't find them consistent. Red Rooster is just such a great consistent option in my humble opinion $9 delivery is a killer Free with uber one because it's technically over the $20 threshold. But they still get you for like a 1.20 service fee Most of the Red Rooster outlets I see are empty, or hardly anyone is inside. Wonder how they make a profit or how they survive. My local dosen't even have tables for eat in- just counter seating. Most of their business is from drive through. Instead of disparaging the great rooter, instead support them Anyone found a store that allows pickup? Yeah there should be many wasnt able to use the offer for pick up orders though There’s no rooster roll in the menu, wtf? A red rooster store delisted the rolls AFTER I took advantage of this LOL. Every time I click the banner the rolls are missing from the menu. I've now switched to another red rooster store and the rolls now show up… So funny when Uber does deals for stores and the stores refuse to play ball. Ordered Rooster Rolls from my local store today for lunch. Unfortunately, I found that the amount of chicken provided was roughly a quarter of what is standard or advertised. It was essentially a bread roll with very little filling, which made for a very poor experience and poor value for money. Very disappointed. Don't know if anyone else had the same experience. definitely tell them. a rooster roll should be filled up properly All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

Title: After A Snake-Like 2025, Is The Bitcoin Price Ready to Break Out In 2026?

Full Content:
The bitcoin price twisted and turned through a tough 2025 — but historical cycles, investor sentiment, and market signals suggest a stronger 2026 may be ahead. We had high hopes for the bitcoin price in 2025. It was supposed to be the crescendo of the four-year cycle, the most bullish setup in recent memory. It was the year after the halving, the ETFs had just been approved, a new president was elected, with the promise of the money printer roaring back to life. Everything looked primed for a Q4 blow-off top, and instead of a new life in Monaco, all you got was this lousy article. What follows is my interpretation of the events of 2025 and my outlook for 2026. I’m not a trader, not an analyst, and like you, I’ve been outperforming professional funds for years, by simply stacking Sats, of course. I’m more of a “fix the money, fix the world” kinda guy, but like everyone else, it’s hard to ignore Bitcoin’s price movements, which I think of as the game of “Snakes and Ladders”. In the game of Snakes and Ladders, momentum drives us forward, but it can also provide a false sense of confidence. You can be one roll away from victory, only to land on a snake that sends you sliding back ten places. As much as hopium dictates that we pray for the price to go ‘up and to the right’, markets rarely oblige. Switching from the board to the chart, price action is played on a board of global liquidity and market sentiment. When sentiment is low or liquidity dries up, no amount of good news can sustain momentum. We simply crab sideways or find a snake that slides us down into further despair. On the other hand, when liquidity floods the system, we often find the ladders that shoot us through resistance levels. For most of 2025, we were stuck playing the former, while dreaming of the “ladder”. So let’s take this time to review 2025 from the perspective of hindsight, as foresight proved to be of little benefit. If there is a phrase that defines the Bitcoin market of 2025, it is exactly that: a Year of Snakes and precious few ladders. Interestingly, and unbeknownst to me, 2025 was indeed the year of the snake according to the 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle, starting January 29, 2025, and ending February 16, 2026. We began the year with the kind of euphoria that usually marks a cycle top. The halving was behind us, and the political stars had aligned perfectly. Google trends showed search queries were soaring. In fact, the year kicked off with a quiet but massive victory before the political fireworks even started: FASB fair value accounting rules took effect on January 1st, finally allowing companies to report bitcoin profits rather than just losses. Then came the main event. We witnessed the inauguration of a “Bitcoin President.” Gary Gensler departed, leaving behind a legacy that, in hindsight, was perhaps less villainous than we assumed, and Ross Ulbricht walked free within 48 hours. With the new administration came a few allies: Paul Atkins took over the SEC and Mike Selig the CFTC, securing a pro-crypto cabinet. The financial plumbing was finally completed. The ETFs were fully operational, options trading on IBIT were unleashed, and it quickly became clear that Michael Saylor was not about to let Larry Fink steal his thunder. MicroStrategy went on a $25 billion buying spree, 100x what they bought in 2020, and the corporate treasury list exploded from 60 companies to nearly 200. By October, the engines were well and truly revving. We hit the All-Time High on October 6th, ready to punch the accelerator for the glorious Q4 end-of-cycle run. Instead, we shifted the gear into reverse and slid all the way down to $80,000. First, we got our knickers in a twist over the “Knots vs. Core” drama. Then came the Binance incident, where the snake manifested itself as a “technical issue” at precisely the wrong time, and right as Gold broke out. We essentially got rug-pulled by a glitch. The issue of October 10th likely created added sell pressure through forced liquidations, whilst also triggering the 4-year cycle sellers who have been trained to sell Q4 of the 4th year. Few understood the gravity of it at the time, though I tip my hat to Jesse Olson for calling it early. Then the FUD machine was turned on. First, it targeted MicroStrategy with threats of MSCI exclusion; it didn’t help sentiment that its mNAV has been dropping all year. Then it pivoted back to Bitcoin with the return of the “quantum attack” narrative. While the headlines swirled, the bitcoin price became stuck in purgatory, range-bound between $84,000 and $95,000 and trapped by options traders, even though the handcuffs had theoretically been taken off IBIT options earlier in the year. Bitcoin was having an Austin Powers moment, while Peter Schiff enjoyed his first day out in the sun since high school. Bless him. While some fear 2026 will bring the hangover of a post-cycle bear market, I, like countless other optimists believe otherwise. If 2025 was the year of snakes, 2026 is the year we finally climb a few ladders. The setup is favourable. We have a Bitcoin-ish president, who’s hungry to fire up the printing press, we’ve a developing multipolar world, where the process of game theory should be heating up, there’s a $7 trillion debt wall to be paid, the old guard are positioned, the regulation stranglehold has been loosened, the cowboys (FTX, Terra-Luna, etc.) are gone, gold and silver have both had their runs, and Bitcoin’s supposed to follow next, or so we hope. Not to mention, the tax year is done, and new budgets have been allocated to fund managers and businesses alike. FASB fair value accounting is now live, smoothing the runway for corporate balance sheets. Michael Saylor is still buying with the relentless intensity of a man who understands math better than Archimedes. Even the “MSCI FUD” was defeated early, so credit to George and the Bitcoin for Corporations team for that victory. At the point in time as the price is beginning to climb higher, the bears are finally showing signs of exhaustion, that’s according to James Check and countless others. By far the most significant headwind Bitcoin faced in 2025 was the relentless onslaught of coins sold by long-term holders. That pressure looks to finally be ending. On November 1st, approximately 67% of the Realised Cap was invested above $95k. The last two months have seen a massive supply redistribution occur, with that metric declining to 47%. Over the last 30 days, around 80% of the coins which have transacted came from higher prices. This is the definition of capitulation. The weak hands who bought the top have flushed out, and new buyers have stepped in with a lower and stronger cost basis. Incidentally, the Year of the Snake officially ends on February 16, 2026, to be followed by a horse, which as we all know has the ability to outrun any bull. This coincides almost perfectly with the monthly CME Futures expiry on February 27th. The shedding of a snake’s skin happens right before the growth returns. Really, who can truly say they know? What we do know is that the four-year cycle is no longer connected to the halvings or the presidential cycles in the way we once thought, and the halvings are less likely to have an effect going forward, as the new coins distributed are a lower percentage of supply, and the miners are supported by huge funds which can help them weather any potential death spiral.We have not seen a Pi Cycle top signal, the 200 week moving average has not crossed the prior cycle top, the MVRV score is just 1.3, the Puell multiple is just .99, we’ve not had a considerable drawdown, and we’re still at the bottom of the range of almost every metric imaginable. For those of you who are old enough to remember the KitKat ad from the 90’s, “the 4 year cycle is not dead, it was just takin’ a break.” As the 4-year cycle is a purely Liquidity Based Cycle, it can be measured by proxy using the ISM Manufacturing PMI, a qualitative index sourced from purchasing managers in the manufacturing industry. I give credit to Raoul Pal for highlighting this metric; he was the first I observed to point out that bitcoin is a “Liquidity” asset rather than a “Halving” asset. Bitcoin, as the highest-beta risk asset in existence, responds to shifts in global risk appetite with greater force and speed than any other asset class. The PMI tracks the business cycle, and it has been in contraction for nearly two years. The current PMI at 47.9 signals ongoing contraction, but ISM projections indicate a 4.4% revenue growth for manufacturing in 2026, crossing 50 in Q2 as Trump’s policies kick in. The bitcoin price should follow. When the ISM PMI is below 50, we’re generally in a bear market, and we’ve been that way for over two years now. The bull markets have historically topped out between 55 and 65. The question remains, when is the business cycle going to see an upturn? TechDev is of the view that it’s happening very soon, as the bullish divergence reversal momentum is decidedly building. The $9 Trillion Debt Question The US government has to address the $9 trillion debt wall that’s due to mature this year. But the nuance is in how they do it. President Trump has made it clear he intends to build a “Dream Military” for 2027 and is pushing for a budget increase to $1.5 trillion. When you combine that with the $4.1 trillion of debt maturing in 2026 and the standard annual deficit, the US Treasury faces a $9 trillion liquidity gap, and a further $7.4 trillion before 2028. Does the US have to print all $9 trillion? No. And through this lens, the recent geopolitical moves make sense. Trump didn’t only capture Maduro for a photo-op; he has likely taken control over 303B barrels of reserves and is enforcing USD oil sales, creating artificial dollar demand and easing the liquidity gap by $2-3T annually. Can he cover the gap via a mix of tariffs (that Americans actually pay for!), Petro-Dollar demand, and the inevitable monetization of the rest by the Federal Reserve? I guess he’ll have to. With Jerome Powell expected to leave his chair in May, the path will be cleared to give the printer engines a whir. There’s another $5 – $10 tr due globally in 2026, and the same again in 2027. So the fed chair won’t be without company. The four-year cycle OGs may be stepping aside, but the Liquidity Cycle is just gearing up, and Bitcoin, as Raoul Pal has long argued, remains the ultimate liquidity barometer. Samuel Benner’s famous 19th-century forecasting chart (first published in 1875), maps long-term cycles of panics (“A” years), booms/high prices (“B” years), and depressions/low prices (“C” years). Interestingly, 2026 falls squarely in one of Benner’s “B” years, which is a period of “Good Times, High Prices and the time to sell Stocks and values of all kinds.” The chart places 2026 right alongside previous boom years like 2016, 2007, 1999, and 1989, suggesting we are entering a structurally favorable window for risk assets. How Long Will The Next Money Printing Last? Prediction: 18–24 months Why: History shows that once the dam gates open, it takes roughly two years to stabilize and reflate. If the official aggressive printing phase begins in late 2025 (as the liquidity uptick and Benner timeline imply, and as M2 shows), it will likely run strong through mid-2027. Prediction: ~$9–$10 trillion in the U.S. Treasury debt is maturing in 2026 alone (about one-third of outstanding marketable debt) and a further $5 – $10 tr globally. Why: As discussed above, the maturity walls for 2026 are nearly double what we faced during the COVID crisis. Yellen extended the pain by leaning on short-term issuance back then, but come hell or high water, that debt has to be paid or refinanced—the money will arrive from somewhere. Because of this, we can expect a new wave of inflation, the 70’s and 80’s have a story to tell about that! Prediction: $250,000 Why: During that $5 trillion COVID expansion, BTC rallied roughly 20x from the $3k–$4k lows to $69k. With the potential for double that liquidity entering the system this cycle, the upside is significant even if diminishing returns apply. From our $16k effective low, a conservative 10x to 12x multiple lands us in the $160k to $200k range as a base case. However, models suggest we could push higher. PlanC’s quantile model points toward $300k+ by the end of 2026, and Giovanni Santostasi’s Power Law projects a peak potentially around $210k early on, with room to stretch as high as $600k in outlier scenarios. But hey, I was expecting +$200k last cycle too. Oh, if the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act moves out of the committee, and if the U.S. Treasury officially starts side-stacking alongside MicroStrategy, all bets are off the table. Prediction: Late 2026 to mid-2027 The Logic: Bitcoin historically tops out 12–18 months after the liquidity expansion enters its “mania” phase. If the ISM Manufacturing PMI crosses back above 50 in early 2026, the perfect storm should unfold throughout 2026, setting up a blow-off top, potentially in the first half of 2027. Bitcoin is unlikely to go straight up, nothing ever does. We’ll almost certainly encounter a few snakes along the way: sharp corrections, regulatory noise, profit-taking, or some form of shenanigans. But the ladders are built, ready and waiting. The Year of the Snake is coming to an end, just ahead of the February 27 CME futures expiry, our potential ignition point, right before the anticipated PMI uptick in Q2. 2025 was a year of snakes and sideways pain, with long-term holders finally capitulated and weak hands flushed out. Now, with a wall of liquidity heading our way, 2026 looks like the ladder we’ve been waiting for. The horse year is coming, so stack and secure accordingly. Good luck.

Larry Fink, president and CEO of investment firm BlackRock, interviewed Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX at the World Economic forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. They spoke about everything from AI to robotics to Mars, and Musk offered a vision of the future that’s coming more quickly than you might think. Here’s an excerpt of their conversation: Larry Fink: So you’re presently building on AI, on robotics, on space, on energy, all at the same time. When you look across those efforts, what do they have in common from an engineering standpoint? Elon Musk: Well, they’re all very difficult technology challenges, but the overall goal of my companies is to maximize the future of civilization, like basically maximize the probability that civilization has a great future, and to expand consciousness beyond Earth. So if you take SpaceX, for example, that SpaceX is about advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend. Life and consciousness beyond Earth, to the Moon, to Mars, eventually to other star systems. And I think we should always view consciousness, life as we know it, as precarious and delicate. Because to the best of our knowledge, we don’t know of life anywhere else. You know, I’m often asked, are there aliens among us? And I’ll say that I am one, but . . . We have 9,000 satellites up there. And not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spaceship. So I’m like, I don’t know. Bottom line is, I think we need to assume. Life and consciousness is extremely rare, and it might only be us. And if that’s the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished, because the way I view it is, the image in my mind of a tiny candle in a vast darkness, tiny candle of consciousness, that could easily go out. And that’s why it’s important to make life multi-planetary, such that if there is a natural disaster or a man-made disaster on Earth, that consciousness continues. That’s the purpose of SpaceX. Tesla is obviously about sustainable technology and . . . And also, at this point, we’ve sort of added to our mission sustainable abundance. So with robotics and AI. This is really the path to abundance for all. People often talk about solving global poverty, or essentially, how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? I think the only way to do this is AI and robotics, which doesn’t mean that it is without its issues. I mean, we need to be very careful with AI. We need to be very careful with robotics. We don’t want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. You know, “Terminator.” But if you have ubiquitous AI that is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy, an expansion of the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent. Fink: How can that be created? How can it broaden the global economy? Musk: In the benign scenario of the future . . . there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is that there’ll be more robots than people. Fink: But how do you then have human purpose? Musk: Yeah, I mean, you know, nothing’s perfect, but I mean it is a necessary, like you can’t have both. You can’t have work that has to be done and amazing abundance for all. . . . But if you have billions of humanoid robots, and I think there will be, I think everyone on Earth is going to have one and going to want one. Because who wouldn’t want a robot to, assuming it’s very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets? If you have elderly parents, a lot of friends might have elderly parent, so it’s very difficult to take care them. Yeah, it’s expensive and they just aren’t enough young people to take care of the old people. So if you had a robot that could take care of and protect an elderly parent, I think that would be great. That would be an amazing thing to have. And I think we will have those things. So overall, I’m very optimistic about the future. I think we’re headed for a future of amazing abundance, which is very cool, and definitely we are in the most interesting time in history. Fink: So in the future that you talk about, the AI models, autonomous machines, rockets, depends on massive increases of compute, massive increases in energy, expensive energy, manufacturing scale. What are the bottlenecks to get there? Musk: I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power. It’s just, right, it’s energy. I mean, we’re seeing the rate of AI chip production increase exponentially, but the rate of electricity being brought online is negligible, 10%, 4% a year, max. It’s clear that we’re very soon, maybe even later this year, we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on. Except for China, China’s growth in electricity is tremendous. They’re building 100 gigawatts of nuclear as we speak. Actually, solar is the biggest thing in China. . . . China, just in solar, can do half of US electricity output per year. Solar is by far the biggest source of energy. And that’s why one of the things we’ll be doing with SpaceX within a few years is launching solar-powered AI satellites because the space is really the source of immense power, and then you don’t need to take up any room on Earth. There’s so much room in space, and you can scale to hundreds of terawatts a year. Fink: You and I have had these conversations before, but why don’t you tell the audience what would it take for the United States and what type of geography would it take to have that solar field to electrify the United States? And why aren’t we doing it? Musk: Yeah, so, I mean, I guess a rough way to think about it is 100 miles by 100 miles, I’ll call it 160 kilometers by 160 kilometers of solar is enough to power the entire United States. Yeah, 100 mile by 100 mile areas is, I mean, you could take basically a small corner of Utah. Nevada. Nevada, New Mexico. Obviously, you wouldn’t want it all in one place. But it is a very small percentage of the area of the US to generate all of the electricity that the US uses. And the same is true, actually, for Europe. You could take a small part. You can take. Relatively unpopulated areas of say Spain and Sicily and generate all of the electricity power that Europe needs. Fink: So why don’t you think that there’s a movement toward that here and in the United States? Musk: Unfortunately, in the US, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high. And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high because China makes almost all the solar . . . We obviously don’t control the US tariff policy. But for other countries, China makes solar cells that are incredibly low cost. Fink: I know you’re going to be having a couple of big announcements on robotics and what it can do. I mean, when I went to the factory, you showed me those robots. You talked about billions of robots, but how quickly can they be deployed in a manufacturing setting? How quickly can it be utilized and be functional and create that abundance that you talked about? Musk: Well, humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. I think we do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory. Probably later this year, by the end of this year I think they’ll be doing more complex tasks. But still deployed in an industrial environment. And probably sometime next year, I’d say that by the end of next year I think we’d be selling humanoid robots to the public. That’s when we are confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you’d like. Fink: You’re already seeing that in Tesla cars, the software changes that you’re doing. And what is it, every quarter now a software change that upgrades the ability of the robot within the car? Musk: Yes, the Tesla full self-driving software, we update it sometimes once a week and recently some of the insurance companies have said that it is actually so safe, Tesla full-self driving is so safe that they’re offering customers half-price insurance if they use has the force of driving in the car. Fink: And that can be monitored by the insurance company? Is that part of the agreement? Musk: Yeah. But I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla’s rolled out a sort of robot taxi service in a few cities and will be very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US. And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe hopefully next month. Fink: Really, that quickly. Musk: And then. Maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully. Fink: I want to move to space, because historically, space is very capital-intensive. It’s historically been done by governments. Obviously, SpaceX changed the whole model. But we’ve seen it slow to scale, and now I’m starting to see it ramping up in what you’re doing and other things.

Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Musk: Well, the key breakthrough, the major breakthrough that SpaceX is hoping to achieve this year is full reusability. So no one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket, which is very important for the cost of access to space. We’ve achieved partial reusability with Falcon 9 by landing the booster stage. We’ve now landed the booster over 500 times. But we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage sort of burns up on reentry for Falcon 9. So, and the cost of that is equivalent to a small to medium sized jet. But with Starship, which is a giant rocket, it’s the largest flying machine ever made. Fink: That’s a rocket that you’re using for the idea of going to Mars, right? Musk: Yeah, Mars and the moon, as well as for high volume satellite stuff. So Starship, hopefully this year we should prove full reusability for Starship which will be a profound invention because the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. It’s the same sort of economic difference that you would expect between, say, a reusable aircraft and a non-reusable aircraft. Like if you have to throw your aircraft away after every flight, that would be a very expensive flight. But if you only have to refuel, then it’s the cost of the fuel. And so that’s really the fundamental breakthrough that gets the cost-of-access to space. Below the cost of freight on aircraft. Under $100 a pound type of thing easily. So it makes putting large satellites into space very cheap. And then when you have solar in space, you get five times more effectiveness, maybe even more than that, than solar on the ground. Because it’s always sunny. You don’t have a day-night cycle or seasonality or weather. And you get about 30% more power in space because you don’t have atmospheric attenuation of the power. Any given solar panel will do five times more energy and space than on the ground. Fink: Is there any capacity in doing that and then taking that power and bringing it back to Earth? Is there a way of doing that or are you just taking that power and utilizing it for the needs, like building AI data centers in space? Musk: It’s a no-brainer for building AI, solar-powered AI data centers in space . . . It is also very cold in space, if you’re in the shadow. So you just have, you have solar panels facing the sun and then a radiator that’s pointed away from the sun. So it has no sun incidence and then it just cooling, it’s just a very efficient cooling system. Net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that will be true within two years, maybe three, three at the latest. Fink: So looking 10 or 20 years out, how would you describe success with AI or space technology, and where do you see it? Are you more certain what’s going to happen the next three years, or five or 10? Musk: I don’t know what’s going to happen in 10 years, but the rate at which AI is progressing, I think we’ve . . . We might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year. And I would say no later than next year. And then probably by 2030 or 2031, call it five years from now, AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively. Fink: Do you see yourself ever going to Mars in your lifetime? Musk: I’ve asked it a few times, like do I want to, you know, die on Mars? And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact. Fink: Elon, thank you. Any last words? Musk: Well, I think generally, I mean my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future. Good. And generally, for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right. Advertisement

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes. The company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October. In the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed. The focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous "two-pizza rule," originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group. As the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. One meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption "how we feed two pizza teams." Another image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption "did someone say 2 pizza team?" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land. "I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal," one employee wrote in the Slack channel. "Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage." Others wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered "reasonably sized." "I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas," another employee wrote. The pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes. One riffed on the rumored timing, splashing "JANUARY 27TH" over the scene from "The Shining" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and "AWS" over his face. Another meme used the "panik/kalm" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words "Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble. Other posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: "able to login," "mail and Slack works," and "no random HR meeting in calendar." Another simply captured the vibe in all caps: "I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask." Amazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees. Have a tip?

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Essay by Eric Worrall “Even after 3 or 5 years more innovation?” “It’s against physics”. NOW – Honeywell CEO says solar power cannot produce cement or steel, "They are very energy-intensive… It's physics… Renewables remain in the mix, but it cannot bring the amount of joules we need to produce this infrastructure which is required in the world." pic.twitter.com/n4zz8KIfjp Anti-renewable blasphemy in the Davos World Economic Forum, the citadel of globalism. The moment when someone tells the emperor he has no clothes. The video is well worth watching, once they get over their momentary shock the quiet part is being spoken aloud, all the panelists nodded and agreed. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, also trashed renewables in Davos 2024 (first published JoNova); The words are out now, and cannot be unspoken. For the last decade I’ve spent writing for WUWT myself and I think many of us have viewed BlackRock as an adversary, and big tech as hypocrites, all cynical exploiters promoting renewables and backing green politicians at the expense of ordinary people. But the money train has left the renewable station. Banks and big tech follow the money, and with subsidies and political goodwill for renewables on the wane, renewables are increasingly uninvestable. Now that Fortune 500 CEOs like Vimal Kapur “I’m an engineer by trade” are speaking out, now big bankers like Larry Fink are happy to throw renewables under a bus, now that President Trump is trashing renewables and cancelling climate treaties, it might seem the battle is won. Not everyone is onboard with the end of renewables. Some big European organisations are heavily invested in renewables, and stand to loose big time if the renewable subsidy hose dries up. Top business leaders issue an expletive-laced message on the green backlash PUBLISHED THU, JAN 22 20262:29 AM ESTUPDATED THU, JAN 22 20268:05 AM EST Sam Meredith@IN/SAMUELMEREDITH@SMEREDITH19 KEY POINTS Top business leaders this week delivered an expletive-laden plea in defense of climate action, describing the backlash to Europe’s green transition as an “aberration.” In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Allianz CEO Oliver Bäte said he disagreed with the suggestion that it may just be a matter of time before net zero is dismissed in Europe, saying short-term thinking on this issue is “bulls—.” Asked about political leaders backtracking on their much-vaunted European Green New Deal and Norway’s oil fund reportedly defending a push from companies to water down their climate goals, Bäte said anyone who has children “will have to worry” about the planet’s future. “It’s an aberration that short-term people are saying that,” Bäte told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Tuesday. “I think it’s about doing it intelligently. And by the way, the role model here is China, they are going to be the leader both in terms of renewable and cost of energy.” … There is one important big player, mentioned in the article above, which wants to see the Western world remain committed to self destructive renewables. ‘Subservient to China’: Net zero warning at Davos as Trump slams the policy, Chinese vice-premier defends renewables America’s shock verdict at Davos has put Australia’s energy future in doubt. And China is at the centre of it all. Harrison ChristianJanuary 23, 2026 – 9:20AM Globalisation wasn’t the only policy to cop extraordinary criticism at Davos — another was net zero. … Donald Trump went even further than Lutnick in his remarks to the forum on Wednesday local time. … “One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing. “China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China. China’s very smart — they make them, they sell them for a fortune, they sell them to the stupid people that buy them.” In the end, it was Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng who advocated strongly for renewables at the forum. “China has put in place the world’s largest renewable energy system and the most complete new-energy industrial chain,” he said in his address. “We invite enterprises from all over the world to embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition, and work closely with China in such areas as green infrastructure, green energy, green minerals and green finance, and jointly create a green and prosperous future.” China makes the vast majority of renewable technology. It also installs more renewable energy capacity than the rest of the world combined, though it remains by far the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. … China, which uses vast and growing amounts of coal to manufacture renewables while maintaining a sham of going green, stands to lose 10s, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars if the world cancels Net Zero. They are using every influence lever they can pull to try to ensure global Net Zero remains on track. China doesn’t seem to care if Net Zero wrecks the global economy, so long as China ends up on top. Perhaps they hope a broken world would be easy pickings for China’s greedy elites. With President Trump strides the world stage, trampling green sacred cows, and some CEOs championing energy sanity, it is easy to think the battle is over. But China is patient, their culture champions the long game. China are doing everything in their power to replace the USA as the global superpower. The measure of their vast influence is the number of Western politicians and leading business figures who still champion green energy and the Chinese way, both within and outside the United States. If President Trump’s successor is not equal to the challenge of continuing the Trump energy abundance agenda, and companies like BlackRock start manoeuvring for trillions of dollars of re-instated green subsidies, 2029 will feel like 2021 all over again. “China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China. China’s very smart — they make them, they sell them for a fortune, they sell them to the stupid people that buy them.” This is a “they are eating the dogs” level lie. Reality just doesn’t matter in trumpland. You seem smart. How can you believe China is going green, when they are still expanding coal capacity? At what point will the penny drop that China is fooling you with a Potemkin village style green sham, while their industrial economy breaks new coal consumption records every other year? How much did their electricity production from coal grew last year? How much of their overall demand growth was covered by renewables? They can expand their capacity all they want when their capacity factor goes down. Let’s wait and see how it looks next year. China’s coal electricity production went up last year of record (2024, Coal fired supply increase 6.1% on year, to cover hydropower shortage). Since renewable generation has increased every year for at least the past decade, you would think even with the hydro down, coal usage would have been stable. Fwiw, demand growth in 2024 was approx.6.5%. Fwiw^2, nuclear had a growth rate of about 7% that same year in China. All the extra added nameplate wind/solar capacity appears to have done…. Last year was 2025 Clearly stated, “last year of record”. But comprehension was never your strong point, was it? CREA/GEM ‘China Coal Power’ August 2025 “Coal remains deeply embedded in the power system with little public discussion of its phase down or eventual exit.” “Coal power continues to expand in absolute capacity terms and remains structurally protected. Current institutions continue to lock in coal’s position” “Coal construction and commissioned projects remain high with no clear signs of slowing. 21GW commissioned in the first half of 2025, the highest first half total since 2016. Full year additions expected to exceed 80GW. Construction starts and restarts reached 46GW, equal to the entire coal capacity of S Korea” “Renewables equal 60% of installed capacity compared to 34% for coal but there is a widening disconnect between capacity growth and actual power production” “Faced with constraints in grid flexibility and market mechanisms Local Authorities have largely defaulted to coal power as the fastest and most controllable way to secure dispatchable capacity” “Only 1GW retired in the first half of 2025……Current efforts are focused on life extensions and retrofitting. Coal exits are politically marginal and institutionally unsupported. BEIJING – China’s coal output rose to a record in 2025, statistics bureau data showed on Monday, as lower domestic prices prompted buyers to cut imports and rebuild stockpiles with cheaper local supply, although the rise was limited by regulator efforts to curb production growth. Production in 2025 reached 4.83-billion metric tons, up 1.2% from 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. More ample domestic supply – a reversal from the coal and power shortages China experienced a few years ago – also encouraged power plants to source better quality coal, said Peng Chengyao, head of APAC power and renewables research at S&P Global Energy. In H1 2025, 21 gigawatts (GW) of coal power were commissioned, the highest amount in the first half of the year since 2016, with projections for the full year exceeding 80 GW. This increase in commissions follows on the tail of the 2022-2023 coal power permitting surge that saw two new coal projects permitted per week, on average, totalling more than 100 GW of coal power approved per year. This trend will likely continue into 2026 and 2027 I asked about the power generated from coal (Twh), not their domestic production or their added capacity… And you were answered, lie spewing moron. Why are you asking? Just provide the details and make your point. “How much did their electricity production from coal grew last year? How much of their overall demand growth was covered by renewables?” NB : I am translating “Renewables” to equal “Wind + Solar (only)” here. I had no idea how China’s electricity generation was split for calender year 2025 when first reading your post … but being a curious fellow with (way) too much spare time on my hands I went looking for some actual data on the Wibbly Wobbly Web … I eventually ended up at the following site, which has monthly “data” up to November 2025 : https://lowcarbonpower.org/region/People's_Republic_of_China/sources Extracting the 21 lines starting with “CN,”People’s Republic of China”,…” — plus the header line with the date information — from their (just over 3 MB) CSV file allowed me to generate a “quick and dirty” spreadsheet plot, which is attached to the end of this post. . Notes – It looks like “Coal” generation levelled off on a “12-month rolling sum” basis during 2025, it neither increased nor decreased. – How much the “Coal” and “Renewable” (nominal / nameplate / baseplate) capacity numbers changed during 2025 is a completely separate issue. – “Renewables” — AKA “Wind + Solar” — has indeed steadily increasing both in absolute and percentage terms since (at least) 2019, but it is nowhere near overtaking “Coal”, let alone (completely) replacing it in China’s electricity mix. – Just because “demand growth” may have been “covered by renewables” in 2025 doesn’t mean all of the CO2 emissions from “Coal” electricity generation are going to drop to “Net Zero” anytime soon (“carbon neutrality before 2060“, according to China’s latest NDC). If wind and solar are so cheap, why would China build new coal plants? Because wind and solar can’t build themselves? 😎 you have obviously never been in China. I have been to every large city there. In winter it can be anything from -15 in Bejing to -30 in the north. It was snowing in Afshan when we were there, and Harbin was just a HUGE SMOG of burning coal. Coal is used for heating and electricity generation in China and with the EVs and heat-pumps+no wind or solar (cos of the smog and windless nightsm etc) they just need more and more electricity from all forms of reliable fossil fuels. And of course the Chinese Communist Party is above bribing parts of The Green Blob to favor Chinese interests. And if you believe that, I have a surefire investment in voodoo acupuncture for you. China energy.. Wind and solar are basically a very small afterthought.. You haven’t spent much time in China, have you? Drown it in soy sauce, and everything tastes the same. Just like snake tastes like chicken, crocodile tastes like chicken, lizards taste like chicken, etc etc. And now the chicken doesn’t taste like chicken. 😉 I was in China a decade, or so, ago, visiting auto plants. At one, we were given lunch in the same cafeteria as the workers. The only item on the menu was some kind of stew. It had a meat of some sort it. It tasted like nothing I had ever eaten before, and certainly not like chicken. I quietly covered my plate with a napkin and ate nothing there at all. I never found out what it was and didn’t ask. I thought it likely was dog. It takes about 3 weeks to get used to Soylent Green. It may well have been cat. It could have been cats or bats (from Wuhan). Actually none of those taste like chicken, and yes, I do know. The Chinese term for dog meat translates to “sweet meat.” I was talking about that: Trump repeats baseless claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets Those re not baseless claims, it was happening and still is, also eating cats and wild geese caught in parks and on ponds/creeks. But hey! Just lie some more, liar, its all you got. All of this has been debunked. Your lies endanger people that are a hard working part of their communities. Hope you are proud of yourself. Haitians are fine people- like everyone else- all most of us want is that if they come to America, it’s done legally. Actually, no. The Haitians Biden Admin fast tracked into America are the ones who f*cked up what government Haiti had and stole every penny the Clinton Foundation didn’t steal. Same with Somalians Biden and Obama Admins prioritized into America. Democrat Party stands with their fellow America hating criminals worldwide. I am, because you keep proving yourself to nothing more than a liar. Good job, buddy. Yes, you are a massive liar. We already know that. They are eating dogs – in China and Haiti. Your holy cows are someone elses food. That’s something you western white fagots can’t even imagine let alone fathom. Kim Iverson ( Vietnamese origin) had some funny jokes about Vietnamese people eating dogs in the USA. The fact that you are such a corrupt hypocrite does not change reality. It is an exaggeration. Trump’s public speech usually loose and hyperbolic. Most people understand that. When will you learn? Very nice Eric. It is a lie that CO2 can cause catastrophic runaway global warming. It is a lie that we must stop using fossil fuels. It is a lie that wind and solar can replace fossil fuels. People give China far too much credit, the only reason they are behaving the way they are is because they are considered a developing country rather than a developed country. They have nothing to lose by net zero and everything to gain. Every nation needs to adopt policies that are best for them without demanding welfare from the developed countries. It is that simple. The renewable backlash will only gain steam going forward. Now that it’s OK to question CC people will start listening to its’ facts and follies. The media will have no choice but to get on board with the ‘new’ narrative or risk losing their already dwindling audience. Ho hum another day another Great Leap Forward with triple somersault and full pike- Shared solar: Labor’s “free power” plan to have daily cap to stop abuse by EV and home battery owners Minister Bowen was naturally uber excited to ejaculate the wonder of free power from the sun whereas the pesky trogs hanging it all together were busy reminding him to do no macro harm as usual with gushing ministerial pronouncements. Particularly as middleclassville had concentrated all the subsidised Teslas solar panels and the latest in massive home batteries in their leafy burbs leaving a paucity of same in struggletown and the mortgagee nappy valleys. That’s hilarious 🙂 Male privilege- The rational capability to suffer life’s universal vicissitudes without blaming other various genders and sundry identifiers. Male privilege = build 99% of everything you can see in a picture of any town. Pay for it with way higher job related injury and mortality rates, while all the lazy unproductive people with liberal arts spit at you from their moral high ground and while the Ladies get the well paid administrative jobs. I still have to see my 1st female roofer,street or bridge constructer or at least a vintage photo of a female building a skyscraper. Solar panels on home rooftops is said to cost 3-4x more than having panels in a grid scale solar farm But in order to get grid scale solar 24/7 you need 3x more panels than equivalent base load fossil fuel (i) supply when sun is shining (ii) supply the batteries needed for the supply when its dark (iii) supply the system when its low sun or cloudy (iv) cost of the battery storage Theres goes the cheap energy when this the infrastructure required . Its much worse when the power needed isnt a sunny part of the country. Solar is like fast food- its only cheap when you need while out and about, not when its for 3 meals a day So, what you are saying is solar is a failure. Should have just opened with that. But he provided the analysis – full marks. Vastly better than the oh so sensitive arm waving. “Top business leaders issue an expletive-laced message” Practical interpretation: technical team could not provide slides with good numbers. Yes. It’s just like you can’t make a cake with dog turds. It’s cooking. It’s fine to leave them “in the mix” though. You will hardly even notice them after a while. If President Trump’s successor is not equal to the challenge of continuing the Trump energy abundance agenda, and companies like BlackRock start manoeuvring for trillions of dollars of re-instated green subsidies a Democrat, 2029 will feel like 2021 all over again. Will at least the autopen be solar powered to make some sort of difference? sarc I loved it when Trump told the Stupid People at Davos that only Stupid People buy windmills! All the Stupid People who buy windmills were sitting in the audience. I love his blunt language. It’s long over due. The ultimate reality check. 😎 He learned a lot about politics his first term but he’s still NOT a politician. That’s a good thing! “… and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China.” Well? Did find a collapsing bridge, and a bunch of collapsing buildings. They make buildings with “tofu dregs”. And a collapsing dam? Well, at this point it is just sorta mobile-ish. But you can find solar “farms” that cover entire mountain sides- up and over the top- for which I see no environmentalists complaining about loss of habitat, loss of biodiversity, loss of “green space”, loss of soil protection, etc. But it’s all for “The Cause” so it’s OK. Mr Kapur? You are SOOOO canceled. Now more invitations to hobnob with the glitterati. And I hope you don’t have teenage daughters, they are going to be SOOOO cross with you for embarrassing them by actually telling the truth. 😉 When the CEO said “I’m an engineer” it was clear that he knew it was worth mentioning. That’s why he said it. He knew that technical knowledge distinguished himself from (most) business leaders attending from Europe. Our business leaders rise through finance, law or (worst of all) sales. They just don’t understand the physical limitations that their industries are constrained by. It’s one of the reasons why Europe’s economy has fallen behind the USA and Asia since China joined the WTO. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Title: Friday, January 23. Russia’s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2026/01/23/friday-january-23-russias-war-on-ukraine-news-and-information-from-ukraine/

Full Content:
ByKatya Soldak, Forbes Staff. Dispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,430 Zelenskyy Rebukes Europe At Davos January 23, the final day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, brought Ukraine neither breakthroughs nor fresh commitments from allies, only bold statements. The most important moment for Kyiv was a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders described the hour-long meeting as “constructive.” Afterwards, Trump emphasized that the war must stop; meanwhile, Zelenskyy, whose arrival in Davos remained in doubt until the last moment due to the acute energy crisis in Kyiv — caused by Russia’s bombing the energy and heating infructrtucture on the coldest week of the winter — used the meeting to underline Ukraine’s need for air-defense missiles to shield its battered energy system. The talks generated no agreements on postwar economic recovery or security arrangements that had been under discussion in recent weeks, as they were clouded by Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about Greenland. Meanwhile, media outlets had expected Ukraine and the U.S. to sign a plan worth possibly billions of dollars, but the agreement was put on hold. Zelenskyy later delivered a pointed speech in Davos, aimed at Europe. In blunt language, he warned that Europe’s internal divisions were a strategic weakness, accusing European allies of failing to “take the lead in defending freedom.” He called Europe a “fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers” that seemed “lost” as it tried to induce Trump to force Russia to end the war. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America’s focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost,” Zelenskyy said. After his speech, Zelenskyy presented estimates of Russian military losses. According to cited figures, Russian monthly casualties have doubled over the past year, to about 36,000. Zelenskyy attributed the increase in casualties to the effectiveness of Ukrainian drones, a priority of Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. Russia’s cumulative losses, he claimed, now surpass 1.2 million personnel, roughly a fifth of which have occurred since last June. The Kremlin, however, effectively absorbs these losses through monthly conscription of 40,000-43,000 troops. Zelenskyy also announced a trilateral meeting involving Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the first such meeting in years, to be held in the United Arab Emirates on January 23. Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine In Davos The annual Ukrainian Breakfast in Davos, hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, centered this year on Ukraine’s EU integration and reconstruction. The January 22 discussion brought together European leaders, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A special guest at the Ukrainian Breakfast was Steve Witkoff, US Special Envoy to the Middle East, and the US negotiator on the Ukraine peace process. He shared updates on the progress in peace negotiations: “I think that we have made a lot of progress,” he said, “We spent the whole dinner last night talking about the upward trajectory for the Ukrainian economy and financial system... The President (Trump) talked about a tariff-free zone for Ukraine, that I think will be game-changing, and you’ll see the industry moving into that area,” he added that he’s headed to Moscow later that day to continue the negotiations with Putin and his government. A recurring theme was how to push Russia toward a peace settlement on terms acceptable to Kyiv. Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe and the U.S. might soon converge on a peace plan for Ukraine. In his opinion, however, it was questionable whether Moscow would accept such a plan, and the war would end only if accompanied by further military support for Ukraine. The debate over using frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's postwar reconstruction, estimated to cost roughly $524 billion, exposed divisions among European countries. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, a skeptic of direct confiscation and fearful of legal action from the Kremlin, reiterated that any such disposition must comply with international law. Still, he acknowledged that Russian assets should play a role in rebuilding Ukraine once a peace settlement is reached. Regarding Ukraine’s European track, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Taras Kachka expressed the opinion that Kyiv would be fully integrated into the EU energy market by 2027, even without formal membership. EU Commissioner Marta Kos supported that assessment, noting that Ukraine has completed most of the reforms required for accession. Nonetheless, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Ukraine’s path to the EU would take several years. Speakers also highlighted Ukraine’s role in defense innovation, particularly in drone warfare. Even with generous reconstruction funds, however, Ukraine’s success is not guaranteed. Referring to what he described as well-designed reforms, Larry Fink said that “Ukraine’s future will depend on whether it can establish strong governance … and integrate itself more deeply into the European and global capital markets.” A January 21 panel, “The Role of the United States in the World,” examined Europe’s security amid shifting U.S. priorities. Former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg shared optimism for future negotiations but warned against trading Ukrainian territory for a ceasefire. He argued time favors Ukraine if it can withstand winter, and that Europe, with U.S. support, could deter Moscow. Russian Attacks Russia launched a sweeping attack overnight on January 20. Although Ukraine's Air Force reported intercepting 27 missiles and 315 drones out of 342 projectiles, the mega-strike, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, left half of Kyiv without electricity amid bitter cold. Zelenskyy said the attack employed “updated tactics” and included missiles produced this year. The strikes came just days after Ukraine received a new batch of air-defense missiles, which, Zelenskyy said, limited the damage. In addition, Ukrainian officials reported at least 14 civilians killed and nearly 80 more wounded in Russian strikes in the previous three days in the Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Title: 'We're going to let VR be what it is and what it does great,' says Meta execs regarding Quest changes

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth went on a series of interviews this week, detailing what's next for Meta Quest headsets, VR gaming, and the company's quest for the Metaverse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In a move that will have lots of Meta Quest gamers screaming "HALLELUJAH," Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth announced that the company would be paring back its investments into the VR version of Horizon Worlds, a Roblox-like metaverse, and focusing its efforts on smartphone gamers, instead. Meta is even removing Horizon Feed from headsets starting with the next Meta Quest software update, v85. Bosworth went on several interviews this week at Davos, a World Economic Forum summit, detailing Meta's next steps for its Reality Labs division. Last week, Meta laid off 1,500 Reality Labs staff and announced the closure of most of its first-party development studios without any official announcement, causing speculation that the company was done with VR. Bosworth told Axios, "we had this integrated concept of where Horizon and VR were the same thing....That is a real challenging piece of work to land. There's lots of people who put this headset on for different reasons. You want to support all those different use cases. The lack of focus comes at the expense of user experience and a great expense at development cost." Nearly two years ago, Meta made moves to more deeply integrate Meta Quest headsets with the company's Horizon Worlds metaverse. The Meta Quest store became the Meta Horizon store, and free-to-play Horizon Worlds content was prominently placed in front of users instead of more traditional gaming content. The result was a substantial decline in game sales on the Quest, backed up by tons of developer data to prove it. Many on social media are saying the changes are too little, too late. Several development studios have announced closures lately, some citing broader challenges across the video game market, while others have attributed them specifically to the VR market. Even developers of games that regularly stay in the top-20 best-sellers have announced layoffs. Allegedly, more are also on the way. "We're going to let VR be what it is and what it does great," Bosworth continued. "We're going to focus a lot more on the third-party content library and ecosystem that has developed there." But according to several interviews I conducted after Meta's studio closures on January 13, 2026, Meta let go of several staff who worked with third-party developers and reduced funding to programs like Oculus Publishing. Bosworth wasn't asked about this topic in either of the Davos interviews, but has so far failed to comment publicly when asked on social media. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Heath's interview with Bosworth revealed that Meta is "still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we (Meta) hoped." We saw this trend begin in mid-2025, although the Christmas holiday period saw the Meta Quest outsell even the Nintendo Switch 2 on Amazon. Even with that success and the success of several new games, Meta looks to be shifting priorities away from first-party development. As Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, said on social media, "Oculus had a strong internal mandate to NOT be Nintendo and instead build things that build the ecosystem. Returning to that is good." "This is not a disaster," Palmer followed up with. Meta "still employs the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude. Nobody else is even close."

Title: Ethereum Emerges As Likely Candidate In BlackRock Tokenization Vision – Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have pointed toward the need for a single, unified blockchain for tokenized markets, and have intensified the focus on platforms capable of handling institutional-scale liquidity, compliance, and settlement. With its long track record in smart contracts, extensive developer ecosystem, and growing role in regulated financial products, Ethereum is now emerging as the most likely candidate to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized capital markets. In an X post, the Ethereum Daily shared a video in which BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made it clear that tokenization is necessary. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Fink said the financial system must move rapidly toward digitization, adding that a single, common blockchain could reduce corruption and improve transparency across the global markets. While Fink did not name a specific network, the most plausible candidate could be ETH, based on BlackRock’s own initiatives and public statements that emphasized the role of ETH in asset tokenization. The firm has consistently highlighted ETH as a core platform for its on-chain strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its BUIDL tokenized money market fund directly on ETH, a product that has already grown to over $2 billion in total value locked. “There’s no second best,” Ethereum Daily noted. In the staking space, Bitmine has turned Ethereum staking into a multi-billion-dollar business. An analyst known as Milk Road has revealed that the company now has 1.83 million ETH staked, worth roughly $6 million at current prices, and plans to scale that figure toward 4.2 million ETH over time. Over the past months, Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) has accounted for nearly 50% of all new ETH entering the staking queue. Staking at this scale is important because it removes ETH from the liquid supply and locks it into long-term infrastructure rather than keeping it for short-term trading. When one player is willing to commit billions of dollars worth of ETH to staking, it reflects confidence in ETH’s future economic prospects. A lower liquid supply, combined with sustained network demand, will create structural pressure over time. Analyst Milk Road has also highlighted that Ethereum is holding near a critical support zone around $3,000, hovering just above the lower boundary of its long-term rising structure, an area that has acted as a stress test for ETH throughout the cycle. Historically, when ETH drifts into this area, the market will need to decide whether the weakness is temporary or structural. The $2,750 level remains the key line because it has repeatedly stopped downside pressure after macro-driven or narrative-driven pullbacks, making it a reliable floor for the broader trend. As long as ETH holds above that level, the broader multi-year uptrend will remain intact. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets.

Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly.

Title: The System Is Starting To Crack – Home Prices Plummet As Silver Hits $100 And Gold Closes In On $5,000

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? There are all sorts of signs that the relentless pressure that has been causing an enormous amount of stress on our financial system is starting to break things. Do you remember how bad things got in 2008 and 2009 when home prices fell dramatically? Well, as you will see below, it is beginning to happen again. Meanwhile, the price of silver and the price of gold both just keep setting brand new record high after brand new record high. That is music to the ears of many of my readers, but for large financial institutions that are holding enormous short positions that has the potential to be absolutely catastrophic. I think that we will be shocked by how violently things start to break loose in the financial system in the months ahead. For decades, those that pull the financial strings in the western world were able to keep the price of silver and the price of gold within ranges that they considered to be acceptable. But now everything has changed. A year ago, nobody was predicting that the price of silver would hit $100 and the price of gold would nearly reach $5,000 in just 12 months. But that is precisely what has occurred… Silver prices rose above $100 an ounce ​for the first time ever on Friday, while gold hit another record en route ‌to $5,000/oz as investors pile into safe-haven assets amid geopolitical turmoil and on expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts. The price of silver is up more than 200 percent over the past year. When there are swings of this magnitude, there are really big winners and really big losers. I think that the identities of the really big losers will start to be revealed soon, and this will shock the financial world to the core. In previous articles, I have gone over many of the reasons why the price of silver has been skyrocketing. But there is one more theory that I wanted to throw out there today. Zero Hedge is reporting that demand in China is “off the charts”, and not too long ago the Chinese implemented severe restrictions on silver exports. Could it be possible that China is purposely attempting to destabilize the western financial system? The Chinese know that there are very large institutions that have massive short positions, and if they can force those institutions to fail that would cause enormous chaos in the U.S. and Europe. If that really is their motive, that would explain a lot. It is very interesting that silver has hit $100 at the exact same moment when gold is almost reaching the $5,000 milestone. Both of those marks are key psychological thresholds, and nobody is quite sure what is going to happen next… Gold approaching $5,000 and silver approaching $100 represent more than incremental price advances. These levels function as psychological thresholds where attention concentrates, behavior changes, and market structure briefly dominates narrative. In market terms, these prices act as an event horizon. The concept is borrowed deliberately. In physics, the event horizon marks the point beyond which outcomes are no longer observable in advance. In trading, it marks the price level that forces participation. Opinions polarize, positioning compresses, and conviction gives way to reaction. These numbers draw in new participants on both sides of the market. Buyers include momentum participants who believe higher prices are inevitable, as well as short positions forced to cover under pressure. Sellers include long holders who have never experienced these prices and view the opportunity to monetize as both rational and psychologically satisfying. Selling silver at $100 or gold at $5,000 carries narrative weight regardless of future direction. Some are convinced that these key psychological thresholds will propel gold and silver to new heights. Others are convinced that these thresholds will act as “ceilings” and gold and silver will start bouncing in the other direction. We shall see what happens. As I write this, the price of silver has just hit $102. I am looking at that number and I can see that it is real, but I am still having a hard time believing it. It is truly difficult to comprehend the pace at which things are now changing. As precious metals soar, home prices all over the United States are starting to fall precipitously… Florida, Texas and California are now firmly at the center of America’s housing crash – accounting for 12 of the 14 major metro areas where home prices are falling. The sharpest drop was recorded in Dallas, TX, where median sale prices slid 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Florida’s once-red-hot housing market is also cracking, with prices falling in Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. California has four declining metros as well, including Oakland, with the second-biggest drop of 5.6 percent, San Jose, Sacramento and Los Angeles. On the one hand, this is good news because home prices had become wildly unaffordable. But on the other hand, if home prices fall too rapidly that will be a very bad thing. Let’s not forget what happened during 2008 and 2009. When housing prices crashed, millions of mortgages were suddenly underwater and foreclosures went through the roof. In previous articles, I have talked about the fact that the number of foreclosures was way up last year. If we are on the leading edge of another giant tsunami of foreclosures, that will be absolutely disastrous for our banking system. Meanwhile, pending home sales just dropped “to the lowest level for any December on record”… Pending home sales, which track the number of contracts signed in December, plunged by 9.3% seasonally adjusted from November, to the lowest level for any December on record in the data by the National Association of Realtors, which goes back to 2010. Compared to December 2010, during the Housing Bust, pending sales were down by 21.5%. The market is now well into its fourth year of the collapse in transactions, and there has simply been no improvement. That is a really bad sign. Unfortunately, demand is likely to continue to be weak for quite some time because we continue to see mass layoffs all over the nation. For example, Amazon is gearing up for another round of layoffs which could end up being the largest in the entire history of the company… Amazon is planning to cut thousands of jobs as part of a broader push to eliminate nearly 10% of its corporate workforce, according to Reuters. After initially cutting roughly 14,000 white-collar jobs in October, Amazon is expected to launch a second round of layoffs impacting a similar number of employees, with an overall target of about 30,000 jobs, although the scope may change, according to two sources cited by Reuters. If fully realized, the cuts would amount to the largest layoffs in Amazon’s history, surpassing the roughly 27,000 jobs the company cut in 2022. So many good paying jobs are being lost. And this is the worst time since the Great Recession to find a new good paying job. In so many ways, it is starting to feel like 2008 all over again. Earlier today, I heard from a reader that explained that my articles really resonate with him because of what he has been going through. That meant a lot to me. I know that so many of you are really struggling right now. I want you to know that it isn’t your fault. Decades of incredibly bad decisions by our leaders have brought us to this point, and now the entire system is starting to fail. We should have fundamentally transformed the system after the Great Recession, but we didn’t. Instead, our leaders chose to inflate all of the old bubbles even larger than before, and now we have a colossal mess on our hands.

Title: Business Leaders Suddenly Fearful as Anger Surges Over AI Replacing Human Jobs

By Joe Wilkins Published Jan 23, 2026 3:02 PM EST It’s an agonizing time for the labor market in the US, where unemployment is on the rise and wages are stagnant. Though there’s raging debate over what degree of blame AI holds for the sorry state of the job market, one thing’s for sure:workers are growing increasingly furious with the tech, which they perceive as undercutting what little job security they had. Business leaders, as a result, are becoming anxious about the blowback — even as they rhapsodize about the coming AI revolution. At the World Monetary Fund summit at Davos, for instance, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva launched into a talk on AI by calling it a “major factor for economic growth.” “We see potential to up of 0.8 percent boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,” she fretted. Her anxious comments come after a year of dramatic layoffs and hiring slowdowns, in which major firms have often pointed at AI. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, for example, said in September that he’d cut 4,000 customer support jobs because he “needs less heads” thanks to automation. In October, Amazon initiated its largest round of layoffs ever, slashing 14,000 office jobs while citing AI as a major factor. It should come as no surprise to those same business leaders that John Q. Public is growing increasingly angry over the narrative that AI is taking its jobs. In its Global Talent Trends 2026 report flagged by CNBC, the analytics firm Mercer found that shop-floor concerns about AI-fueled job loss have surged from 28 percent in 2024 to 40 percent in 2026. The firm’s research also found that 62 percent of employees feel their leaders underestimate the psychological and emotional impact of AI. And why shouldn’t they? Executives have spent the last year bragging about the supposed AI revolution, rhetoric they’ve used to game enough investment dollars to fundamentally alter the US economy. Workers, in turn, shouldn’t be blamed for taking their lead — though in today’s economy, it seems they’re the only ones expected to pay the price.

Title: These Two Charts Sum Up the AI Stock Rally in 2026

Artificial intelligence is once again fueling a scorching tech stock rally, but the rising tide is notably not lifting all boats. Shares of companies making memory and data storage devices soared in the first weeks of 2026, fueled by a shortage of the hardware essential to training and running AI models. Sandisk (SNDK) stock has doubled in value in less than a month, while Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) have each gained more than 30%. They’ve been joined by semi caps, the firms whose products enable the design and fabrication of the chips powering the AI revolution. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) stock was up more than 25% as of Thursday's close, followed closely behind by Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC), each up nearly 20%. The AI rally has been the driving force behind the stock market for more than three years. But the AI trade has repeatedly shape-shifted, with investors bidding up certain sub-sectors and industries as new bottlenecks in the AI infrastructure buildout emerge. Then there’s Intel (INTC), one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Wall Street is betting that investments by the federal government and AI king-maker Nvidia (NVDA) will help the storied chipmaker turn things around after years of trouble. The stock plummeted on Friday after the company issued a disappointing outlook for the current quarter, reminding investors that the turnaround they seek will be “a multiyear journey,” in the words of CEO Lip-Bu Tan. On the flip side are software stocks, beaten down by concerns that artificial intelligence is more threat than opportunity at the moment. Software giants like Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE) and Salesforce (CRM) are among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. Investors are worried AI-native start-ups are poised to take share from enterprise software incumbents whose deployment of AI agents has moved slower than expected. AI is also seen as a threat to the seat-based pricing model that helps make software-as-a-service companies stable and profitable. Investors are also down on software stocks because most of the industry isn't profiting from AI nearly as much as "pick-and-shovel-makers" like Nvidia—at least not yet. Software executives can attribute small profit margin gains to AI-driven efficiency, but investors are more excited to hear Micron say its high-bandwidth memory chips are sold out through this year because of AI demand. Digital marketing software company Applovin (APP) is one of the few exceptions. The stock soared more than 700% in 2024 and doubled in value last year, because of strong revenue and earnings growth that executives attribute to its AI-powered platforms. (Several short-sellers attribute the meteoric growth to shady practices.) Applovin stock's previous gains are a big reason it's the S&P 500’s worst performer this year. Investors have taken some very profitable chips off the table amid a slump driven by software pessimism and, earlier this week, more allegations Applovin's platforms facilitate illegal activity. The stock was down 22% heading into Friday’s session.

Title: Amazon May Announce Thousands of Corporate Job Cuts Next Week

Amazon is reportedly preparing to announce thousands of corporate job cuts next week, Reuters is reporting today. The company already laid off 14,000 corporate employees in late October, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hinted at the time that more job cuts would be coming due to “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Reuters previously reported in October that Amazon was planning to get rid of 30,000 corporate workers in total, and this new round of layoffs is expected to affect AWS, retail, and HR units. Amazon had already laid off 27,000 employees at the beginning of 2023 to adjust to the post-pandemic era. “Jobs in the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was unclear. The people cautioned that the details of Amazon’s plans could change,” the Reuters report reads. Amazon currently employs over 1.55 million employees worldwide, with approximately 350,000 corporate jobs before the first round of layoffs was announced in October. As Jassy previously said, Amazon is all-in on generative AI and agents, and the exec encouraged employees to “use and experiment with AI whenever you can” and learn “how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: Wall Street braced for a private credit meltdown. The risk of one is rising

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/23/2026 10:38:52 AM PST by Presbyterian Reporter The sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight. Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making “garbage loans” and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit. While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven’t lifted completely. Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital , as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR , still trade well below their recent highs. The rise of private credit Private credit is “lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it’s growing really fast, which doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC.

The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making “garbage loans” and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit. While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven’t lifted completely. Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital , as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR , still trade well below their recent highs. The rise of private credit Private credit is “lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it’s growing really fast, which doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector’s competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes. After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said.

While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven’t lifted completely. Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital , as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR , still trade well below their recent highs. The rise of private credit Private credit is “lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it’s growing really fast, which doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector’s competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes. After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector’s competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes. After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.

Title: The AI Energy Supercycle: Striving to Secure 24/7 Power Infrastructure

January 23, 2026 13:35 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity-Insider.com News Commentary – The global push for Artificial Intelligence is colliding with a considerable physical bottleneck: the power grid is struggling to keep up with data centers' explosive demand[1]. As facilities transform from passive consumers into active energy partners, the market appears to be shifting focus toward assets that can deliver reliable, around-the-clock baseload power. With the U.S. government committing billions to revive domestic uranium enrichment to fuel both current reactors and next-generation modular systems[2], the industry is seeing an unusual wave of activity as institutional capital is beginning to flow toward the companies anchoring this new energy foundation, including Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), NANO Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE), and Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF). While renewable energy capacity continues to expand globally, the intermittent nature of wind and solar means they currently have trouble powering the high-performance AI superclusters that require constant, firm energy. This reality has turned energy security into a strategic mandate, with new policy frameworks appearing to treat the nuclear fuel supply chain as vital national infrastructure rather than just another commodity. Consequently, the industry seems to be entering a systemic re-rating phase as the Western world races to secure the physical assets required to help power a digital-first economy. Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) recently announced a pending merger with uranium miner Eagle Energy Metals, a next-generation nuclear energy company with the largest mineable, measured and indicted U.S. uranium deposit. Following the announcement, Eagle Energy Metals announced that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because following the SPAC merger, the company is heading toward a NASDAQ listing, subject to customary closing conditions, under the ticker symbol NUCL. Notably, the team orchestrating this transaction is the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy Metals holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and seeking to quadruple U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds rights to exclusive Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) have announced an agreement supporting development of a 1.2 GW nuclear power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to supply clean energy for Meta's regional data centers including its AI supercluster in New Albany. The agreement provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and fund project advancement for Oklo's Aurora powerhouse deployment on 206 acres of land formerly owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. "Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality," said Jacob DeWitte, CEO of Oklo. "Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward." According to the company, pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. "Our agreement with Oklo enables the development of 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear energy in Southern Ohio, supporting Meta's operations in the region—including our AI supercluster in New Albany," said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta Platforms. "By investing in baseload nuclear energy, we're helping build a resilient and sustainable future for our communities." The scalable powerhouse facility plans to expand incrementally to deliver the full 1.2 GW target by 2034, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs. NANO Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE) announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Ameresco to explore deploying its advanced modular microreactor technologies on federal and commercial sites across the United States. The collaboration will evaluate potential pathways for siting, development, construction, licensing, operation, and eventual decommissioning of NANO Nuclear's nuclear modular microreactors including KRONOS MMR, ZEUS and LOKI MMR systems. "This MOU marks another milestone for NANO Nuclear as we continue to build customer demand for our approach to delivering reliable, modular nuclear microreactor energy systems in support of the United States' energy transition," said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear. "Working alongside Ameresco, a leading U.S. publicly traded energy infrastructure company, gives us the opportunity to test our advanced, patented microreactor technologies against real-world requirements at scale, across both federal and commercial levels." Following comprehensive assessment of regulatory and financial considerations, stakeholder engagement, site suitability and utility interconnections, Ameresco and NANO Nuclear expect to enter specific agreements under which Ameresco would lead engineering, procurement and construction activities for sites using NANO Nuclear's systems. The companies plan to coordinate on government funding and available incentives as the initial assessment advances. Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) announced updates on advancements for its RapidSX™ rare earth element separation technology commercialization and its USD$22.4 million U.S. Department of War Other Transaction Agreement through the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Orlando. Ucore reported that, since December 2023, it has completed approximately 5,700 hours of REE processing with tonnes of heavy mixed rare earth oxides in an automated 24-hour per day commercial production environment at its Kingston, Ontario Commercialization and Demonstration Facility, dedicated to transitioning the RapidSX™ technology to its under-construction Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria. "The nearly two years of CDF demonstration work undertaken by Ucore has been done with deliberate coordination with the Louisiana SMC production roll-out pathway," said Mike Schrider, P.E., VP and COO of Ucore. "The result is a technically proven and de-risked commercialization pathway to commence heavy rare earth processing in Louisiana in 2026." The company has produced multiple rare earth element groups and products including TbDy, Tb, and Dy, demonstrating 2 to 4 times faster throughput over conventional solvent extraction methods. Full commercial-scale Louisiana SMC work is underway for the installation of RapidSX™ Machine #1 in mid-2026.

Image: Amazon Amazon is reportedly set to launch a second round of job cuts next week as it works toward a goal of trimming 30,000 corporate employees. According to a report from Reuters, this new wave could begin as early as Tuesday and is expected to be similar in scale to the 14,000 white-collar roles eliminated this past October. Sources familiar with the matter say the reductions will likely impact units including Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and human resources. The total reduction represents nearly 10 per cent of the company’s corporate workforce. While Amazon employs over 1.5 million people, the majority work in fulfillment centres and were not targeted in this specific round of cuts. While internal documents previously tied the October cuts to the power of artificial intelligence, CEO Andy Jassy later suggested the move was about fixing company culture. Jassy told analysts that the firm had developed too many layers of bureaucracy and management. Despite this, Jassy has noted that AI efficiencies will likely continue to shrink the corporate headcount over time as routine tasks become automated. This downsizing marks the largest layoff period in the company’s three-decade history, exceeding the 27,000 jobs cut in 2022. For those let go in the previous wave, a 90-day grace period on the payroll is scheduled to expire this Monday.

Title: The great power gap: Billionaires are 4,000 times more likely to hold office than you are, and Oxfam warns it’s ruining democracy

There’s not just a K-shaped economy of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. This K shape of diverging paths extends to politics, a new report found, and experts warn it’s threatening democracy as a result. According to Oxfam International’s “Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power” report this week, a billionaire boom has coincided with the rise of the richest exerting political influence, with billionaires 4,000 times more likely to hold office than less wealthy people globally. And if those billionaires aren’t running for office, they’re pouring money into campaigns. Per Oxfam, one in six dollars spent by all U.S. candidates, parties, and committees in the 2024 elections came from 100 billionaire families. The majority of Americans are already concerned the Trump administration will benefit the rich more than ordinary people. A CBS/YouGov poll conducted in December found 65% of respondents believed Trump’s policies favored the wealthy, while 12% believed they favored the middle class, and 1% said his policies favor the poor. According to Nabil Ahmed, Oxfam America’s senior director of economic justice, the rise of billionaires’ participation in politics not only empowers the ultrawealthy few to pursue their agendas; it disempowers everyday people from feeling like their votes or campaign contributions matter. “There is way too much power that is being held in the hands of way too few right now, and that undercuts people’s economic freedom, political freedom, and it also fundamentally undermines the value of one’s participation in the political system,” Ahmed told Fortune. “We actually do face a moment in which there is a fundamental choice between oligarchy and democracy.” The United States is experiencing this reckoning now, the Oxfam report suggested, as powerful figures mix money, business, and policy in service of their own interests. Watchdogs have criticized the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial for its significant overseas investments—as well as the launch of its own memecoin and mining operations—claiming they represent conflicts of interest. The president, with a $6.8 billion net worth, added $1.4 billion in digital assets to his family’s wealth in the first year of his second term, a Bloomberg analysis this week found. “The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fortune in a statement. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has explicitly proclaimed intentions to influence lawmakers to help Trump. Musk donated at least $132 million to the 2024 election bid of Trump and his GOP allies. He’s back at it for the 2026 midterm election and funneled $10 million this week to the campaign of Kentucky Republican Nate Morris, a pro-Trump candidate bidding to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell following his retirement, Axios reported. In addition to swaying elections, wealth may also be tipping the scales in court. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published this month and led by Columbia Business School economist Andrea Prat found pro-wealth policies and actions are correlated with judicial outcomes. In 1953, Democratic and Republican Supreme Court appointees had statistically indistinguishable rulings on matters regarding wealth, the study found. By 2022, Republican justices voted in favor of cases benefitting the wealthy 70% of the time compared to 35% of the time for Democratic justices. “There’s an American tradition and there’s an American tension” in reckoning with how the U.S. government and private sector have both enabled and prevented the growth of wealth and wealth disparities, Ahmed said. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink called out this tension earlier this week, saying in his opening remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the AI boom resembled a period of concentrated wealth not seen since the Cold War’s end, which sparked a surge of globalization. Without intervention, Fink warned, global tech companies could recreate these dynamics, seeing their own wealth increase at the expense of white-collar workers and the professional class. “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more wealth has been created than in any time prior in human history, but in advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,” Fink said. “Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data and owners of infrastructure.” “The open question: What happens to everyone else if AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers?” he added. Oxfam has advocated for a slew of policy changes to curb the political power of the wealthy, including the regulation of lobbies and campaign financing, as well as imposing wealth taxes to reduce the political and economic powers of the superrich. These solutions are proving challenging to implement. California’s proposed wealth tax, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on all assets of state residents with a $1 billion or greater net worth, has drawn criticisms from even more politically progressive figures. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has opposed the potential ballot measure, saying it would cause billionaires with vital resources to leave the state, as illustrated by the exodus of Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Others have suggested that because many billionaires are actually cash poor, holding most of their wealth in illiquid assets, the ultrawealthy get away with paying few taxes even when they are implemented. Edward Gellis Fox and Zachary Liscow, law professors from the University of Michigan and Yale University, respectively, argued the solution to the “billionaire borrowing loophole” is to tax the proceeds of wealth so that borrowing funds is treated like income. “Our nation faces concerningly high wealth and income inequality, and strong revenue needs,” they wrote in a 2024 paper. “Closing the borrowing loophole on the super wealthy would combat both challenges and raise more than $100 billion in a highly progressive and reasonably efficient way.”

Title: Davos Elites No Longer Pretending Their Globalist Shindig Helps Anyone But Themselves

Globalist elites at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, appeared to change their tune from pretending to want to improve the world to simply benefiting themselves. World leaders, including President Donald Trump, gathered for the WEF on Wednesday, which claims that it is “committed to improving the state of the world.” However, The New York Times’ newsletter, “The World,” pointed out on Thursday that elites and CEOs are abandoning this approach to benefit themselves financially. “All the former buzzwords — social justice, sustainability — have gone.” (RELATED: Trump Yanks Canada Invite To Board Of Peace After Davos Clash) It appeared to many that Larry Fink of BlackRock, who is the co-chair of the WEF, was more interested in making this a business conference. “‘Committed to improving the state of the world’ has mostly disappeared from view,” the Times said. 🚨 GLOBALISM JUST DIED IN DAVOS Howard Lutnick just walked into the lion’s den — and told the World Economic Forum exactly what they didn’t want to hear. “Globalism has failed.” Not whispered.Not softened. Declared — on their own stage. He dismantled the entire WEF doctrine… pic.twitter.com/PUzOe0XK7e — Jim Ferguson (@JimFergusonUK) January 21, 2026 Fink was a strong advocate for green energy and has pushed for environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). In 2023, he announced that he would ditch the term, “ESG,” because of its political connotations. The CEOs of Visa, JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, Cisco and other large companies were present for the gathering of world leaders, according to PBS News. The event was the first to be held without Klaus Schwab, the founder of the WEF. He resigned as chairman in April 2025 after The Wall Street Journal reported allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination against a pregnant employee, age-based firings and research manipulation. The WEF previously used buzzwords such as “social justice” and “sustainability,” though they backed away from using these terms at this year’s gathering. Several attendees attended lavish dinners and parties instead of conducting business or diplomacy meetings. Companies such as Palantir and Meta hosted invite-only dinners, receptions and cocktail hours and outspent traditional corporate participants. Borge Brende, the president and CEO of the WEF, said that the event is not “about responding to current events,” but rather creating “the right conditions that enable us to move forward.” Trump also told the business executives at the event that he has made them much richer, PBS News reported. “I don’t even ask anybody how you’re doing now,” Trump said. “It’s like everybody is making so much money.” All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Things are looking up for a small Italian eyewear company after French President Emmanuel Macron sported its shades at the World Economic Forum this week. Shares of iVision Tech (IVN), which has a market cap of around €20 million ($23.5 million), are up 65% this week, with much of that gain coming on Friday after photos of Macron began circulating showing him wearing the aviator-style sunglasses. Throughout the highly-publicized event in Davos, Switzerland this week, Macron wore a pair of glasses from Maison Henry Jullien, a French company owned by iVision Tech. The latter is based in Milan and listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Macron has been wearing glasses since January 15 due to a broken blood vessel in his eye, which makes his eye appear red. The 48-year-old French leader said the optical problem is "totally benign." The glasses — Maison Henry Jullien's Pacific S 01 model — aren't cheap. The company's site lists them at €659 ($774). Still, interest in the glasses is soaring. The firm said it had to set up a temporary webpage for the Macron-preferred model due to heavy traffic.

"To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model." Speaking with Reuters, iVision Tech CEO Stefano Fulchir said Macron's high-profile appearance in the glasses "certainly created ‌a wow effect on the stock." Macron wore the glasses during a panel with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in a solo speech, and around the Swiss town during the week. It's unclear what caused Macron's eye condition. In his more than hourlong speech in Davos, President Donald Trump himself wondered aloud about it. "I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said. "What the hell happened?"

Title: Gates Foundation plans to give away $9 billion in 2026 to prepare for the 2045 closure while slashing hundreds of jobs

Conventional wisdom tells us all good things must come to an end. And that’s what the Gates Foundation is preparing for. Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates told Fortune first about their plans to shutter their $86 billion charitable foundation in 2045. (French Gates is no longer part of the foundation, having stepped down in 2024 from her role following the couple’s divorce. She now runs her own foundation, Pivotal Philanthropies, focused on gender equality and global health.) This year, the Gates Foundation will spend a record $9 billion and cut as many as 500 staff jobs during the next five years as the world’s largest private foundation plans to shutter. The foundation’s motivation for its move is to accelerate giving to global health, poverty, and education, helping beneficiaries take ambitious bets now rather than maintaining operations indefinitely. These moves underscore how one of the defining philanthropic institutions of this century is reconfiguring for its sunsetting era. The Gates Foundation’s move to spend down raises questions about who will fill their proverbial shoes. Perhaps it will be a figure like MacKenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has donated $26 billion to thousands of organizations in just the past five years. The Gates Foundation’s board approved the largest budget in its 25-year history at $9 billion, a decision coming less than a year after Gates said the institution would close its doors by Dec. 31, 2045, and spend down roughly $200 billion over two decades. As part of The Giving Pledge, Gates has promised to give away about 99% of his fortune, calling the accelerated timeline a response to “pressing” global problems that can’t wait for traditional giving procedures. The foundation has already distributed more than $100 billion since its inception, becoming a dominant funder in global health, vaccines, and antipoverty work, and an outsized player in U.S. K-12 education. The board also approved the foundation’s recommendation to increase the budgets of several programs for this year, ranging from women’s health to AI in U.S. education. To hit its 2045 deadline while increasing its grantmaking, the Gates Foundation will cut up to 500 of its roughly 2,375 staff positions by 2030—about 20% of its headcount—through attrition and layoffs, according to a Jan. 14 press release. The board also approved a cap on operating costs, limiting overhead such as salaries, infrastructure, facilities, and travel to no more than $1.25 billion, or roughly 14% of the total budget. “While progress is possible, it remains fragile, and delivering on our mandate requires a commitment to move forward with transparency for our employees and partners and disciplined stewardship of the foundation’s finite resources,” Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, said in a statement. He added that the reductions will be gradual and reviewed annually, rather than a one-time wave, as the organization shifts more dollars from operations into grants. Gates’ decision to sunset the foundation firmly places it in the “time-limited” camp, which is starting to gain traction among other modern mega-donors who argue that hoarding capital in perpetuity doesn’t work in today’s society. One other example is Scott, who has already donated $26 billion since 2020 to thousands of charities and has repeatedly helped organizations facing federal funding cuts. In 2025, Scott issued three lifelines to organizations in the aftermath of federal funding cuts, including a $45 million gift to The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ youth crisis organization. “This historic donation from MacKenzie Scott comes at a time when The Trevor Project has never needed it more,” Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, said in a statement shared with Fortune. “LGBTQ+ youth in the U.S. are facing a growing mental health crisis, and the resources they have for support continue to be politicized and jeopardized.” In 2025, Scott also made a $60 million donation to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy just as the Trump administration moved to slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an organization Americans rely on for help during and after hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, and floods. Scott also donated $80 million to historically Black college Howard University—a gift that came at an “opportune time,” helping the HBCU weather a federal government shutdown that delayed annual appropriations supporting student success, research, and hospital donations. Scott is also a prime example of someone in the billionaire class who is actively attempting to share as much of her wealth as possible instead of holding on to it forever. For nonprofits focused on global health and development, the Gates announcement is a double-edged sword. It means more money will be dispersed in the near term, but it also sets a firm expiration date on one of the organizations they rely on the most. Many of the foundation’s biggest bets—from vaccines and disease eradication to agricultural innovation—often require long lead times and coordination with governments and other organizations. This raises the question of what happens after 2045. As the Gates Foundation continues its 20-year shutdown process, pressure will grow on peers, like tech billionaires and next-gen heirs, to either step in to help or face questions of why they’re not doing enough. French Gates recently said there’s more the ultrawealthy can do. While more than 250 of the world’s wealthiest have signed the pledge, many have so far failed to live up to it. “Have they given enough? No,” French Gates said in an interview with Wired published in December. “We’re trying to demonstrate for them: Go big. You can go big, you can go bold.”

With just over 20 days into 2026, several companies are already planning job cuts. Major companies, including Amazon, aim to cut thousands of corporate jobs across various divisions, potentially marking its largest layoffs yet. Ericsson plans to eliminate 1,600 jobs in Sweden to stay competitive, while FedEx will cut 500 jobs in France but also create new positions. Citigroup and BlackRock have announced significant layoffs. Here's a list of companies planning layoffs recently — E-commerce giant Amazon is set to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week as part of its workforce reduction strategy, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two people familiar with the matter. These layoffs, possibly the company's largest, are expected to affect white-collar roles across divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video, and retail. However, the report indicated that the plans might change. Telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson, earlier this month, announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at maintaining the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. The company expects to continue laying off employees as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Reuters quoted Ekholm during a post-earnings call. On Friday, US parcel delivery company FedEx announced a strategic overhaul of its French domestic operations, including a plan to cut up to 500 jobs and invest about 78 million euros ($91.58 million). FedEx plans to streamline its internal structure by cutting its station count from 103 to 86. This move aims to simplify the distribution network and eliminate unnecessary infrastructure across the country. Although job cuts are part of the plan, the reorganisation is also expected to create over 770 new full-time and part-time roles. FedEx stated that employees affected by layoffs would be given priority consideration for these new positions. Banking giant Citigroup is expected to lay off approximately 1,000 employees this month as CEO Jane Fraser aims to reduce costs and boost returns. The current round of job cuts at Citigroup is part of the company's plan, which was announced two years ago, to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, according to a Bloomberg report citing people aware of the development. The Metropolitan Opera of New York announced a round of layoffs on Tuesday as it struggles financially, despite having implemented other significant cost-cutting measures over the past five years, according to a report by The New York Times. Met announced additional cost-cutting measures, including salary reductions for its highest-paid employees and delaying a new production scheduled for the upcoming season. According to the report, the opera house will reduce its administrative staff by 22, decreasing the total from 284 to approximately 262, which is about 10% of the division's workforce. BlackRock earlier this month said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, Bloomberg reported. According to a report citing people familiar with the development, BlackRock will lay off about 1% of its workforce, or about 250 employees across divisions.

Title: Czech arms maker CSG soars on trading debut

Czechoslovak Group's shares rose as much as 32% in their Amsterdam debut, pushing its market capitalisation to more than €30 billion following a record fundraising for a defence company listing. CSG, seeking to tap into a surge in military spending, sold 30 million new shares and up to 122 million existing shares, including an over-allotment option, in an initial public offering priced at €25 each, raising up to €3.8 billion. Michael Strnad, the 33-year-old owner of the company, will net just under €3 billion in the deal, including the over-allotment, while the rest of the proceeds will go to the company, CSG said. The offering for up to 15.2% of the company gave CSG an initial market capitalisation of €25 billion. By 9.43 am on Friday, CSG's market value had risen to €31.6 billion with shares trading at €31.60, up 26.4%. They had climbed as high as €33.00 in early trading. Tapping into defence sector boom Investors are piling money into the sector and European governments pledge to ramp up defence spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European defence stocks have touched record highs this year. Strnad told Reuters this month that one of the reasons for the listing was to use stock as potential acquisition currency. Recent acquisitions include its $2.2 billion purchase in 2024 of leading U.S. small ammunition maker Kinetic, owner of brands such as Remington. At current prices, CSG has a larger market capitalisation than Czech utility CEZ, the country's biggest listed company. CSG's key customers include Ukraine and it is one of the world's fastest‑growing defence companies, producing large- and small-calibre ammunition, heavy ground equipment and radar. Order books attracted swift demand If fully exercised, CSG's offering would be the largest Amsterdam listing since KKR Private Equity Investors raised $5 billion in 2006, according to Dealogic. Other large European defence groups, such as Franco-German tankmaker KNDS, are also set to list this year. Order books on the CSG offering were quickly covered on Tuesday, a bookrunner said. Funds managed by Artisan Partners, BlackRock and Al-Rayyan Holdings, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority, have committed to cornerstone the deal with 300 million euros each. Led by Strnad, whose father began trading old Soviet-era military equipment in the 1990s, CSG has built up its order pipeline and said in November that revenue would rise to 7.4–7.6 billion euros this year, from the more than 6.4 billion expected for 2025. It targets a dividend payout of 30%-40% of net profit, payable from 2027. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

The Shareholders Are Hungry: They must feast on livelihoods! And bones! And they demand more! More! More! Amazon is planning to cut thousands more corporate jobs next week, according to a report by Reuters. Back in October, Amazon trimmed 14,000 jobs. The plan, supposedly, has been to cut around 30,000 jobs. Why? Not because of artificial intelligence, or earnings, but "culture," as per CEO Andy Jassy. Too many people? Too much bureaucracy. Sorry, tech brethren. Save the Date: Sound Transit is going to announce when it's going to open its Crosslake Connection and knit together the spine of the 1 line with the east side 2 line. They'll make that announcement at 10 a.m.—which is in the future at the time of this writing. I will update this if I remember. Two Hikers Dead on Mount Rainier: Two backcountry hikers on Mount Rainier were reported missing earlier this week. Rangers found them, both dead, on Wednesday. Timber: A falling tree on Lena Lake Trail in the Olympics hit and killed two women in their 70s. ICE Out Act: Down in Olympia, Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton has introduced a bill that would bar anybody who became an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer during Donald Trump's second term from ever becoming a law enforcement officer in Washington. "I don’t want people that are trained in that culture to come and infiltrate our culture," Simmons said. Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, is the only other sponsor of the bill. The Weather: Another crisp, sunny day. Meanwhile, seemingly everyone else in the country is going to get rocked by a dramatic winter storm. Texas and Oklahoma are preparing for snow! The storm will stretch from the southern Rockies up through New England. You know who is not included in that? Us. It's so lonely in this mild winter. Though, maybe I should be grateful. Dozens of states have issued states of emergency in advance of the oncoming storm. White House Uses AI-altered Photo as Propaganda: The Justice Department arrested demonstrator Nekima Levy Armstrong for the crime of interrupting a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota because of the pastor's alleged ties to ICE. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo of Armstrong's arrest to X. In it, Armstrong looked calm, composed, stoic. Later, the White House posted its own photo showing Armstrong open-mouthed sobbing, tears streaming down her face. The picture was manipulated with generative AI tools. In a response to questions about the doctored photo, Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director for the White House, said, “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.” This is the first example I’ve seen of an American government using AI to meaningfully misrepresent actual events with the intent to deceive the public. We are at Stalinesque levels of propaganda. donmoynihan.substack.com/p/past-the-b...[image or embed] There's a Big Game This Weekend: The Seahawks will play in the NFC Championship game in Seattle on Sunday. As the old adage goes: Fuck the Rams. Minnesota on Strike: The Day of Truth & Freedom general strike is on in Minnesota this Friday. To protest the ICE killing of Renee Good, Minnesotans are participating in a "no work, no school, no shopping" blackout. It's been endorsed by the Minneapolis City Council. Businesses around the state are shutting down in solidarity. The demands of the action are simple: ICE needs to GTFO, Jonathan Ross—the agent who killed Good—needs to be held accountable, Congress needs to stop federal funding for ICE, and there needs to be an investigation into the agency's actions. JD Vance Pins Blames on Minnesota Officials: Vice President, expectant father, and couch lover JD Vance told the press that the one thing that would "lower the temperature" in Minnesota is if local officials cooperated with federal law enforcement by "helping ICE identify and arrest violent criminals so that the operation could be more targeted," as The Guardian reports. In fact, the federal government suspects Minnesota officials are conspiring to impede federal efforts in the state. The US Justice Department subpoenaed local officials like Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week to investigate these conspiring claims. Walz called it "political theater." Good's Autopsy: Renee Good's autopsy—which was commissioned by her family—showed she was shot four times. Once in the forearm, once in the right breast, and once in her head near the left temple. That bullet exited through the right side of her head. She also sustained a graze wound. Why the fuck did that man shoot her at close range four times? Everyone Has a Role in Resistance: A Minnesota man offered up his screen printing talents and studio to help stand up to ICE. You don’t know your role yet maybe, but we are all finding out just what we have to offer. In Minneapolis, one man knew immediately what he could offer and said “Bring me your clothing”.[image or embed] Deuces: Trump has officially pulled the US out of the World Health Organization since the organization is, as he says, "straying from its core mission." That's surely a sign of our country's good health, right? Good News for Brainrot: TikTok finalized a deal to create an American entity, a move that circumvents the national security concerns that threatened a ban of the app. US investors in the new joint venture include Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. President Donald Trump praised the deal, thanked China's President Xi, and said he hopes, "that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok." Hell Is Also Elsewhere: Wildfires are raging in Chile. They've gobbled up record 45,700 hectares of forest which is the equivalent of a 176 square miles. The fires have killed 21 people so far. While firefighters are trying to stop the blazes, people are trying to hurt them. There have been two attacks on firefighting brigades—one of which included gunfire (it's unclear why they were attacked). Plus, arsonists are having a field day. At least 70 people have been arrested for setting or attempting to set new fires this fire season. A Food Review: Have you seen the ads for the new Applebee's cheeseburger sitting open-faced in a pile of cheese? This man has. "The O-M-Cheeseburger, the purest distillate of Americana yet produced." Queer Bait: The straight ex-hockey player brothers behind the hockey podcast "Empty Netters" are in hot water after publicly praising the steamy gay hockey show Heated Rivalry but bashing it in private. Their episodes praising Heated Rivalry have hundreds of thousands of more streams than their regular content. The hosts, realizing the grift at their disposal, started hawking Heated Rivalry t-shirts. Too bad they actually hate the show. A Song for your Friday: Marty Supreme gave me a new appreciation for this song. Sad that the soundtrack was snubbed from the Oscar nominations, but ya can't win 'em all, right? Which is probably one of Marty Supreme's themes. Nathalie Graham has reported on everything from Seattle City Hall to underwater hockey for The Stranger. She likes covering anything she finds fun, weird, or interesting. You can find a lot of that in her column, Play Date. She hates dentists and loves costume parties.

Title: Fear meets resignation in Davos as Trump dominates WEF agenda

Saturday, 24 Jan 2026 U.S. President Donald Trump walks during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2026. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan ‌23 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials rolled through the icy streets of Davos this week, fear and in some cases loathing ‌were mixed with resignation over the administration's way of doing business. While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump's positions ‌on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them. "It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here," said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump's address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. "He was very ‍outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me," Cramer told Reuters. Business leaders were ‍also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they ‌were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment. WEF'S MOST EVENTFUL MEETING? Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most ‍eventful ​meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year's event "A Spirit of Dialogue". Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace,drawing several world leaders to Davos. The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close ⁠to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ‌travelled to Davos. President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Several participants told Reuters ⁠that the annual meeting -- the ‍first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab's departure last year -- had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment. Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda. Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold. Moderators in some sessions ‍appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has ‌opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16. Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room. TRUMP AGENDA LOOMS LARGE Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence. Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a "mixture of geopolitics that can't be ignored". But there had also been "a lot of really interesting dialogue" around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters. The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed ‌Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of. The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at 'Goals House', where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's 'I'm on Fire'. As usual at the parties and meetings around ​Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety. Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town. As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine.

Title: Apple turning to Intel for future iPhone chips, analyst reaffirms

Multiple reports have indicated that Apple is turning to Intel for future iPhone chips. Now, analyst Jeff Pu is out today with a new research note once again affirming an upcoming partnership between the two companies. In December, Pu reported that Intel will start producing chips for Apple’s non-Pro iPhone models starting in 2028. In a research note seen by 9to5Mac today, Pu says that Intel has a “solid external customers pipeline” for 14A, which is the company’s 1.4nm-class process technology. Among the companies in that pipeline are Apple, AMD, and Nvidia. “We reiterate our expectation of potential order-wins such as Apple’s SP SoC and NVDA/AMD’s x86 server chips,” Pu says. Ming-Chi Kuo has also reported that Intel will “begin shipping Apple’s lowest-end M processor as early as 2027.” This would presumably be the base model M7 chip, which could be used in select iPad and Mac models. Under this arrangement, Apple will still develop and design its own iPhone and Mac processors in-house. The difference is that, instead of exclusively using TSMC to manufacture those chips, Intel would come aboard as an additional partner. This is not a return to Intel chips powering the Mac (or the iPhone). What do you think about Apple and Intel reuniting for iPhone and Mac chips? Let us know down in the comments.

by Heide Lazaro Freepik/Reddit Company success should be shared with the entire organization. The following story involves a man working at a small company. The company proudly announced it reached tens of millions in revenue. Because of this, all employees will be getting some sort of “reward.” Read the full story below and find out more. This should be short and sweet. The company I work for proudly announced that it made tens of millions of pounds in revenue this year. We exceeded our revenue goals by millions. We’re a small company with less than 100 employees. This man learned that he and his colleagues will be getting an Amazon gift card. Yesterday, our office manager proudly announced that we’d all be getting a £25 Amazon gift card. I’ve heard of these things happening. I even joked during the revenue announcement that the layoffs would be next. I still didn’t think the ironic skinflint move would happen to me. Wow! What a tempting reward! lol Let’s see how others reacted. We live in a sad, greedy world, says this one. Short and simple. Finally, this one got a blanket and a chocolate. Nothing says “we smashed our goals” quite like a gift card that barely covers lunch. If you liked that story, check out this post about an oblivious CEO who tells a web developer to “act his wage”… and it results in 30% of the workforce being laid off.

When Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs in October, it warned that more layoffs were coming in 2026. According to Reuters, that round is set to begin next week and, once again, will sweep away thousands of jobs. The exact number of job cuts in the latest round is unclear, but sources tell Reuters it could be on par with the last round as part of Amazon’s broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs. Departments expected to take a hit include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Prime Video, human resources, and retail. Although 30,000 represents a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million global workforce, it accounts for 10% of its corporate staff, the report adds. Most other employees work in warehouses and fulfillment centers. In October, CEO Andy Jassy argued that the layoffs weren’t driven by financial struggles or AI development. “It’s culture,” he noted. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, said in a memo to employees that "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and...we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." In a June memo to workers, meanwhile, Jassy warned that generative AI and AI agents would change the way people work at Amazon. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added.

Title: Bitcoin regret is coming for anyone ignoring Coinbase CEO’s 5% rule as banks fight to cap gains

Advisors are building caps, rebalancing rules, and drawdown math while crypto execs sell regret avoidance as the new thesis. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Bloomberg at Davos that investors who don't have at least 5% of their net worth in Bitcoin will “probably be pretty sad” by 2030. Recently, Morgan Stanley's wealth management division published portfolio guidelines capping crypto exposure at 4% maximum for even its most aggressive growth models. Both used “5%” as their anchor. Neither meant the same thing. The post-ETF era didn't just mainstream Bitcoin ownership, it turned position sizing into the new battleground. Financial advisors, wealth managers, and compliance officers now treat roughly 5% as a responsible ceiling for a volatile satellite holding. Meanwhile, crypto executives are trying to reframe that same number as a minimum effective dose. The collision isn't about whether to own Bitcoin. It's about whether 5% means “cap your risk” or “don't miss out.” Multiple mainstream wealth platforms converged on allocation bands clustered under 5% over the past year, driven not by ideology but by portfolio math. Fidelity Institutional's advisor-facing research suggests allocations of 2% to 5%, extending to 7.5% for younger investors under optimistic adoption scenarios. The framing centers on downside containment, as Bitcoin's structural volatility demands position sizing that won't blow up a portfolio during drawdowns. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's October 2025 report gets more granular. It recommends maximum crypto allocations by model: 0% for conservation and income portfolios, 2% for balanced growth, 3% for market growth, and 4% for opportunistic growth. The rationale is explicit risk management, with roughly 55% annualized volatility and potential 70% maximum drawdowns at the 95th percentile. The firm emphasizes quarterly rebalancing to prevent positions from “swelling” silently as Bitcoin rallies, turning a controlled 3% sleeve into an accidental 8% overweight. Bank of America's chief investment officer said in December 2025 that a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets “could be appropriate” for investors comfortable with elevated volatility. A $4.6T wealth machine is turning “execution only” into real advice, and it starts with a tiny-sounding sleeve. BlackRock recommended up to 2% in late 2024, warning that above that threshold “Bitcoin's share of total portfolio risk becomes outsized,” a textbook risk-budget argument. The common thread: Bitcoin gets a seat at the table, but only as much as volatility math permits. The Bitwise and VettaFi 2026 Benchmark Survey, fielded from October through December 2025, shows how this plays out in practice. Among client portfolios with crypto exposure, 83% are allocated to less than 5%. The modal band sits at 2% to 4.99%, capturing 47% of advisors. The industry didn't coordinate on this range through central planning. It emerged from parallel risk calculations across wealth platforms, aimed at defending Bitcoin positions, to compliance committees and nervous clients after drawdowns. Armstrong's exact phrasing matters. He didn't say “5% of your portfolio.” He said, “5% of their net worth.” For many households, those denominators tell wildly different stories. The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances documents that the balance sheet of families in the middle of the net worth distribution is “dominated by housing,” meaning net worth includes large illiquid buckets that never touch brokerage accounts. Consider illustrative math for a household with $2 million in net worth. If investable assets total $800,000, then 5% of net worth equals $100,000, which translates to 12.5% of the liquid portfolio. If investables are $500,000, then the same $100,000 is 20% of the portfolio. At $300,000 in investables, it's 33%. The “quiet implication” of framing Bitcoin as a net worth floor is that it can easily translate into double-digit liquid exposure, far beyond the caps wealth managers are building into their models. This isn't a technicality. It's the difference between “responsible satellite allocation” and “concentrated bet.” Advisors constrained by suitability reviews and model portfolio guardrails can't casually recommend liquid Bitcoin positions of 15% to 25%. However, that's precisely where “5% of net worth” lands for households whose wealth is tied up in real estate, retirement accounts with limited crypto access, or business equity. Advisors are funding crypto by cutting equities and cash, not “play money,” signaling a risk-managed allocation shift. The 5% debate didn't heat up randomly. It emerged because the market structure shifted and the industry moved from “should I?” to “how much?” Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in early 2024 opened access for registered investment advisors and clients who couldn't or wouldn't touch crypto through exchanges or custody solutions. Fidelity explicitly frames the 2024 products as unlocking advisor-client conversations that compliance risk previously shut down. Bank of America's move to have advisors switch from execution-only to recommendation status marks a regime change. Bitcoin went from “we'll let you buy it” to “here's how much we think makes sense.” Institutions build risk budgets, not narratives. Morgan Stanley's emphasis on volatility simulations, drawdown scenarios, and rebalancing schedules reflects career-risk management. The pain for a wealth advisor isn't being wrong about Bitcoin. It's being wrong loudly: allocating 10% to a client portfolio, watching it crash 60%, and trying to explain to compliance why the position exceeded model guidelines. Caps and rebalancing rules are defensive scaffolding that let advisors participate without getting blamed if things go sideways. Meanwhile, executives are selling inevitability. Armstrong's Davos framing is a regret-minimization pitch, not a risk-budget pitch. The subtext: Bitcoin's upside is so asymmetric that the risk of owning too little outweighs the risk of owning too much. That gap widens when institutions finally open the pipes, because the narrative can claim, “The last excuse is gone.” If Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock all offer Bitcoin access, then “I couldn't access it” ceases to be a defense for zero exposure. Armstrong's $1 million by 2030 projection illustrates the math behind aggressive sizing. Bitcoin traded around $89,346.09 as of press time. Reaching $1 million by the end of 2030 implies roughly 63% compound annual growth from here, an 11.2x total return. High upside scenarios mathematically require accepting high variance, which is exactly why chief investment officers talk in caps and rebalancing rules. The gap between 2% ceilings and 5% net worth floors is a gap between institutions managing downside and individuals chasing upside. While gold flirts with $4,900, the BTC/Gold ratio has entered a "trapdoor" that historically precedes a monster mean reversion. As banks and platforms legitimize access through recommended ETF sleeves rather than execution-only workarounds, policy shifts from permissioning to prudence. Morgan Stanley's October report is essentially a blueprint for where “responsible Bitcoin” discourse is heading: volatility-adjusted position limits, model-portfolio integration with explicit caps, and mandatory rebalancing to prevent silent overconcentration. The firm treats crypto like any other high-vol satellite, such as emerging markets equities, commodities, and alternatives, where the default assumption is that unmanaged positions will drift into risk-budget violations. The industry is converging on a sub-5% portfolio norm at the exact moment executives are trying to raise the minimum to 5%. That tension defines the post-ETF era. Distribution is mainstreaming, so the argument moved from ownership to sizing. Advisors can finally add Bitcoin to client portfolios without triggering compliance red flags, but they're doing so with guardrails that crypto maximalists consider cowardly. The denominator problem makes the collision messier. When an executive says “5% of net worth” and an advisor hears “5% of portfolio,” they're describing positions that can differ by a factor of two or three for typical households. The advisor is thinking about risk contribution and drawdown scenarios. The executive is thinking upside capture and regret avoidance. Both are using the same number. Neither is wrong. But they're solving for completely different objectives. The outcome isn't that one side wins. It's that “5%” becomes a Rorschach test, a point of coordination that means whatever the speaker needs it to mean. As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. For wealth managers building model portfolios, it's a ceiling that keeps crypto exposure from dominating total risk. For crypto advocates pitching inevitability, it's a floor that separates the prepared from the regretful. The meme works because it's vague enough to let both sides claim victory while talking past each other.

Title: The Book That Explains the Heritage Foundation Meltdown

Conservatism Stephanie Slade | 1.23.2026 10:35 AM On a Thursday night in December, I got a breathless call from a Heritage Foundation senior scholar. John Malcolm and Jessica Reinsch, the director and a deputy director of the think tank's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, had just been summarily fired. A Heritage spokesman would later accuse Reinsch and Malcolm of conduct inconsistent with the organization's mission and standards and breach of fiduciary duty. Sources close to the situation say they were actually dismissed after their superiors learned they were about to take jobs elsewhere—and realized that they may not be the only ones. A few days later, the bulk of the think tank's economic and legal/constitutional studies teams decamped en masse for Advancing American Freedom (AAF), a nonprofit founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. More resignations would follow. But according to my source on that December night, Heritage President Kevin Roberts and his lieutenants had a message for those who stayed behind: "​​They've been going around the building telling everyone that our whole purpose now is to support and do everything Kevin Roberts wants." While the proximate cause of the ongoing staff exodus is a video Roberts recorded in October defending Tucker Carlson's decision to amplify the white-nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes, the turmoil at Heritage has been brewing for far longer. In fact, Reason has learned, Heritage leadership has been directing employees to read Roberts' 2024 book, which agitates for a "Second American Revolution," and to leave if they can't agree with the positions therein. Scores of board members, employees, and visiting fellows have opted to depart, variously citing antisemitism, misogyny, retaliation against employees who dare to speak up, and an institutional pivot away from free market principles. In conversations with more than a dozen current and former staffers, I repeatedly heard that Roberts' belief that he alone should get to determine all of the think tank's stances has provoked resentment among his own subject matter experts. "The issue is you have the president of an organization committing everybody in it to his position unilaterally," one senior staff member told me in November. "Because Heritage has a one-voice policy, when the president goes out and says Heritage Foundation has this position"—be it support for tariffs or support for Tucker Carlson—"he implicates everybody down the chain, and he makes everybody stand for that." * * * A Heritage statement responding to last month's mass flight to AAF begins with "Our mission is unchanged." Likewise, in a January 1 letter printed in The Wall Street Journal, Heritage Vice President Roger Severino insisted that the think tank has changed tactics but not principles. But multiple recently departed staff members confirm that they were told by superiors to look not to Heritage's official mission statement ("to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense") but to Roberts' book in order to understand the think tank's de facto new direction. The perception was that if they couldn't get behind the ideas in the book, Heritage was not the place for them. "Parts of the building were basically holding Bible studies with it," one former senior scholar quipped. There's nothing controversial about the head of a think tank enumerating his or her views, and indeed, it's a timeworn tradition on the American right for would-be thought leaders to publish books that attempt to define and defend conservatism. But the situation in Roberts' case is complicated by two factors: the aforementioned one-voice policy at Heritage and the contents of this particular book. Dawn's Early Light is a fairly explicit attempt to chart an alternative course for movement conservatism. "If you've read a lot of conservative books or think you have a good sense of the conservative movement," writes then–Sen. J.D. Vance (R–Ohio) in the foreword, "I suspect the pages that follow will be surprising—even jarring." Those pages are replete with scornful references to "wax-museum conservatives" who "don't know what time it is," by which Roberts clearly means the kind of staid Reaganite wonks who care more about hewing to conservative principle than owning the libs—the kind of people, in other words, who have historically populated the institution he leads. Fire and flames are a recurring motif in the book (the original subtitle of which was "Burning Down Washington To Save America" until the publisher apparently thought better of it). The first chapter features a long list of "decadent and rootless" American institutions that Roberts says need to be burned to the ground, including the FBI, The New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, and the Boy Scouts of America. "We're going to (metaphorically) burn down the LA district attorneys office," he says at one point. "We need to (metaphorically) burn down the selective educational institutions that have such a grip on the formation of our elites," he says at another. "​​If an American institution is incompatible with or contemptuous of public prayer," he says in a third place, Roberts "would be hard pressed to believe that it should not simply be burned down for the common good." This inflammatory (pun intended!) imagery is in keeping with Roberts' open embrace of populism and sympathy for the highly aggrieved "New Right." It's also an awkward fit for a conservative movement that has long counseled respect for inherited institutions and expounded the Chestertonian notion that civilizations are hard to build and easy to destroy. But this book was written to be a postliberal broadside in the culture war. It is polemic, not scholarship. * * * To be clear, not everything in Dawn's Early Light is a departure from the past. There's plenty of standard-fare conservatism (China hawkery, support for secure borders and making English the national language). From a civil libertarian perspective, Roberts' antipathy toward the federal bureaucracy and especially the surveillance state is even rather salutary. But there are also a number of record-scratch moments, particularly when it comes to his discussion of economics. In theory, free enterprise and limited government are core Heritage principles, and the think tank was historically a staunch defender of free trade. Roberts' book, on the other hand, comes out swinging against globalization, in which "US firms sought to make profits all over the world by expanding into new markets, sending factories overseas, running money through international tax havens, developing global supply chains, and employing other new strategies," and calls for using "the immense powers of our federal and state governments" for protectionist ends. It also asserts more than once that President Donald Trump "won" the trade war during his first term. Roberts is equally hostile to the modern financialized "sham economy," which he says is guilty of "funneling money to the parasitical enemies of the American way of life." In his view, the goal of the conservative movement should be to return to an economic system that would allow more men to support families on a single income, and he hopes to "restore the proper use of the government" to bring about his favored outcomes. He's comfortable with trade barriers, industrial policy, and the aggressive use of antitrust regulations "to rein in globalist corporatism," he writes. "Especially when it comes to Big Tech and big banks, we need to consider the nuclear option." The book acknowledges that all of this would require "short-tem sacrifices, including higher prices for some consumer goods," but insists the pain will be worth it. To reiterate, these positions are more closely aligned with the New Right than with old-school American conservatism. And that's not only the case with respect to economics. Roberts' foreign policy views are also seen by many former staffers as antithetical to the long-standing posture of the think tank he heads. This is not the first time Roberts has seemed to commit his institution wholesale to a set of ideas that are more at odds than not with the traditional American right. In 2022, he gave a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami in which he startled observers by declaring that he was there "not to invite national conservatives to join our conservative movement but to acknowledge the plain truth that Heritage is already part of yours." Dismayed by the natcons' will-to-power political approach, a person of my acquaintance (who had been hired by Roberts) left a job at Heritage shortly after that speech. Many have followed in the years since, often for similar reasons. * * * All of this would arguably matter less if not for the think tank's practice of barring employees from publicly dissenting from the Heritage party line. "Speaking with one voice is a distinguishing piece of The Heritage Foundation's strategic advantage," its website proclaims. "While other organizations may have experts advocating contradictory points of view, Heritage employees are always rowing in the same direction." The so-called one-voice policy, which dates back to Heritage cofounder Ed Feulner's time at the helm, "has always—for 49 years—been difficult to implement," Roberts told The Dispatch in 2022. "The difficulty is making sure that there is a conversation internally that gets us to a good spot." Over and over again in my conversations with current and former staffers, I heard that intellectual collaboration under Roberts' predecessors has been supplanted by decrees handed down, literally, from the president's office on the eighth floor. "When Ed Feulner was there, we debated these things, and that's how we came to a one-voice policy," a senior policy staffer (who has since resigned) told me in November. "Under Kevin Roberts, it's just whatever Kevin Roberts and his minions decide, without any consultation from the scholars." "Kevin Roberts, in my opinion, has subverted the one-voice policy," another scholar who left last year told me in December. Ideally, "the one-voice policy at Heritage is that everybody gets together, all the substantive experts on an issue, and they hash it out. They come up with their own internal view, and then people agree that they won't, using a Heritage byline, go out and disagree with that position. What Kevin did differently was, basically, that he constrained the Heritage position to not be contrary to what the Trump administration wanted to hear." Lending a certain plausibility to this claim is that Roberts himself announced in a 2024 interview with The New York Times that he sees "institutionalizing Trumpism" as the think tank's role. (A Heritage spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) "I can directly testify to being told that Dr. Roberts has special knowledge that no one else has," which should influence policy conclusions, a former research staffer told me in December. "That's cult-of-personality stuff. That's not what a think tank's supposed to be….There were instances where it was communicated to us in no uncertain terms, either fall in line or here's what happens to people that don't: They end up gone." Faced with such an ultimatum, more and more Heritage staffers have chosen to go elsewhere. The wax-museum conservatives are calling Kevin Roberts' bluff. Start your day with Reason.

Title: Fear meets resignation in Davos as Trump dominates WEF agenda

By Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham and Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials rolled through the icy streets of Davos this week, fear and in some cases loathing were mixed with resignation over the administration’s way of doing business. While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump’s positions on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them. “It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here,” said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump’s address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. “He was very outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me,” Cramer told Reuters. Business leaders were also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment. WEF’S MOST EVENTFUL MEETING? Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most eventful meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year’s event “A Spirit of Dialogue”. Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace, drawing several world leaders to Davos. The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Davos. President Vladimir Putin’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Several participants told Reuters that the annual meeting — the first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab’s departure last year — had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment. Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda. Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold. Moderators in some sessions appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16. Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room. TRUMP AGENDA LOOMS LARGE Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence. Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a “mixture of geopolitics that can’t be ignored”. But there had also been “a lot of really interesting dialogue” around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters. The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of. The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at ‘Goals House’, where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen’s ‘I’m on Fire’. As usual at the parties and meetings around Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety. Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town. As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine. (Reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham, Samia Nakhoul, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Oliver Hirt, Arianne Luthi, Vitalii Yalahuzian, Divya Chowdhury, Mark John and John Revill; Editing by Alexander Smith) Di Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham e Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Svizzera, 23 gennaio (Reuters) - Mentre il presidente Donald Trump e altri alti funzionari statunitensi percorrevano le strade ghiacciate di Davos questa settimana, la paura e in alcuni casi il disgusto si mescolavano alla rassegnazione per il modo di fare affari dell’amministrazione. Mentre molte persone presenti all’evento hanno detto a Reuters di ritenere che alcune delle posizioni di Trump su questioni globali, come la richiesta che l’Europa spenda di più per la propria sicurezza, abbiano un merito, sono rimaste profondamente offese dal modo in cui lui e il suo team le hanno presentate. “È stato un po’ travolgente. È stato un vero e proprio show di Trump”, ha detto Conradin Cramer, capo del governo cantonale della città svizzera di Basilea, dopo il discorso di Trump di mercoledì all’incontro annuale del World Economic Forum. “È stato molto esplicito contro l’Europa, contro i valori europei, e questo mi ha spaventato”, ha detto Cramer alla Reuters. Anche i leader del mondo degli affari erano nervosi, con due banchieri statunitensi che hanno ammesso all’inizio dell’incontro che Trump e il suo team hanno presentato.Due banchieri statunitensi hanno ammesso all’inizio di essere preoccupati per lo sviluppo di una vera e propria guerra commerciale che avrebbe colpito il sentiment delle imprese. L’INCONTRO PIÙ EVENTUALE DELWEF? Diversi partecipanti hanno detto che, secondo alcune misure, questo è stato uno degli incontri più movimentati in cinque decenni di WEF, che ha etichettato l’evento di quest’anno “Uno spirito di dialogo”. Trump ha stretto un accordo sulla Groenlandia a margine con il Segretario Generale della NATO Mark Rutte e ha presieduto alla firma del suo nuovo Consiglio di Pace, attirando a Davos diversi leader mondiali. Il presidente e altri funzionari statunitensi hanno anche detto di essere vicini a un accordo con il governo degli Stati Uniti. Il presidente e altri funzionari statunitensi hanno inoltre dichiarato di essere vicini a un accordo di pace in Ucraina, che è stato messo a fuoco giovedì quando il presidente Volodymyr Zelenskiy si è recato a Davos. Anche l’inviato del presidente Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, ha avuto colloqui con funzionari statunitensi a margine, primo funzionario russo a venire a Davos da quando la Russia ha invaso l’Ucraina nel 2022. Diversi partecipanti hanno detto a Reuters che l’incontro annuale - il primo dopo la partenza del fondatore del WEF Klaus Schwab lo scorso anno - è stato una vittoria per il CEO di BlackRock Larry Fink. Un portavoce ha detto che Schwab non era disponibile per un commento. Fink, che è anche co-presidente del WEF, ha usato la sua influenza per attirare grandi nomi, tra cui il miliardario Elon Musk, che ha fatto il suo debutto a Davos come aggiunta dell’ultimo minuto all’ordine del giorno. Trump ha detto che Fink ha trasformato in oro tutto ciò che ha toccato. I moderatori in alcune sessioni sono sembrati evitare le domande difficili e l’ordine del giorno ha costeggiato in gran parte le questioni che l’amministrazione Trump ha contrastato. Il programma prevedeva quattro sessioni che facevano riferimento al cambiamento climatico, mentre nel 2022 erano 16. Trump ha parlato per più di un’ora, ben oltre il tempo assegnatogli dall’agenda, e quando si è seduto per una sessione moderata di domande e risposte un piccolo ma costante flusso di delegati stava già lasciando la sala. L’AGENDA DI TRUMP SI ALLARGA Diversi partecipanti hanno detto che, nonostante Trump incombesse, a Davos gli affari si sono svolti, con i dirigenti che hanno incontrato clienti e committenti e discusso di questioni che vanno dalla geopolitica e dal commercio alle monete stabili e all’intelligenza artificiale. Francesco Ceccato, CEO di Barclays in Europa, ha detto che l’incontro ha avuto un “mix di geopolitica che non può essere ignorato”. Ma c’è stato anche “un sacco di dialogo davvero interessante” intorno all’IA e a questioni correlate come il rischio di investimento e il fabbisogno energetico, ha detto Ceccato a Reuters. L’agenda di Trump ha permeato molte delle discussioni. Il Segretario al Commercio degli Stati Uniti Howard Lutnick ha suscitato aspre reazioni quando ha attaccato l’Europa durante una cena organizzata da Fink, dalla quale la Presidente della Banca Centrale Europea Christine Lagarde è uscita. La sera successiva, a una cena della Bank of America, Lutnick si è intrattenuto con l’amministratore delegato Brian Moynihan, ha dichiarato una fonte che ha familiarità con l’evento alla “Goals House”, dove il ministro delle Finanze britannico Rachel Reeves ha giocato a scacchi e Marcus Mumford si è esibito dal vivo, con una versione acustica di “I’m on Fire” di Bruce Springsteen. Come di consueto alle feste e agli incontri intorno a Davos, i partecipanti hanno spettegolato e scambiato voci, anche se alcune hanno scatenato l’ansia. All’inizio della settimana è circolata una voce secondo cui le reti di telefonia mobile e internet sarebbero state interrotte all’arrivo di Trump in città. Come poi si è scoperto, sia i telefoni che internet hanno funzionato bene.

Title: Intel stock crashes hard today: why did Intel stock plunge 16% after Q4 2025 earnings despite beating estimates – has INTC collapsed before a potential comeback?

Intel stock ($INTC) suffered a massive 16.20% crash today. The decline wiped out over $30 billion in market value. This happened despite Intel beating Q4 2025 estimates with $13.7 billion in revenue. The company also posted a surprise non-GAAP EPS of $0.15. The real damage came from a weak Q1 2026 outlook. Intel expects revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion. This midpoint is far below the $12.5 billion analysts wanted. Investors were also spooked by a projected breakeven profit for the next quarter.

Friday, 23 Jan 2026 FILE PHOTO: Water vapour rises from residential buildings' autonomous heating systems during a power blackout and freezing temperatures, after critical civil infrastructure was hit by recent Russian missile and drone attacks, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine January 19, 2026. REUTERS/Vladyslav Sodel/File Photo DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine is ‌nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" after months of Russian airstrikes on energy systems and any future ‌peace deal must include a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, the head of ‌Ukraine’s largest private power producer said. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an "energy terror" campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems. The capital ‍Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities ‍say, and Kyiv's mayor urged residents to ‌leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go. "We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on ‍the ​energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?” Ukraine has endured two weeks of ⁠temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he ‌said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities. Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used ⁠in the interests of ‍Ukraine's armed forces. "We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe," Timchenko said. "People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already." He said Ukraine was holding on ‍thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, ‌as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity. DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets. "We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction," he said. U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian ‌plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country. Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and ​missiles, he said. "We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today," he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences.

Title: Trump steals show in Davos with mixed bag of rhetoric, results at elite gathering

US President Donald Trump made a significant impact at the World Economic Forum in Davos. His visit drew attention away from business topics like AI and renewable energy. Trump's foreign policy discussions and his proposed 'Board of Peace' initiative were central. He also reversed a decision on tariffs. Technology leaders like Elon Musk and Jensen Huang also participated. On his third visit to Davos while president, Trump came and went over about 24 hours. He delivered a rambling and at times hyperbolic speech that touted America's global role.

Title: Blackrock boss working on $800 billion plan for Ukraine’s economy – Witkoff
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/631423-blackrock-fink-ukraine-reconstruction/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T14:37:14Z

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has joined US President Donald Trump’s Ukraine team as a “prosperity adviser,” US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced. After a similar project failed last year, Fink will once more be tasked with pulling Western capital into Ukraine. Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos on Thursday, Witkoff described Fink as “the best-in-class prosperity adviser,” adding that he “was good enough to volunteer for the job.” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has spoken repeatedly about developing a “prosperity plan,” aimed at attracting $800 billion in foreign investment to Ukraine after a peace agreement with Russia is reached. While Ukrainian officials met with BlackRock executives to discuss this plan last month, it was unclear from reports about the closed-door meeting what level of involvement the firm would take in implementing it. BlackRock is the world’s largest investment firm, managing more than $12 trillion in assets. BlackRock owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, whose weapons have seen extensive use by Kiev’s forces in the Ukraine conflict. The firm began work on a Ukraine ‘reconstruction fund’ in 2023, and had trouble attracting investors. According to the New York Times, the firm originally aimed to get $50 billion to $80 billion in investments, before cutting this target down to $15 billion. The fund was shelved indefinitely last year “due to a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty over Ukraine’s future,” Bloomberg reported. Ukrainian officials met with Fink in Davos on Thursday. According to Ukrainian National Security Council chief Rustem Umerov, the meeting was also attended by EU officials and representatives of major US investment firms, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. However, investors still face the same uncertainty that led to BlackRock abandoning its original reconstruction fund: Moscow and Kiev are still at odds over the terms of a peace deal, Ukraine has suffered an unknown number of military casualties, Kiev is still entirely dependent on foreign aid to keep its government functioning, and stories of endemic corruption within Zelensky’s circles have dominated headlines recently. US President Donald Trump has described US investment in Ukraine as vital to recover the massive financial aid provided to Kiev by President Joe Biden’s administration. Earlier this month, Trump told Fox News that his efforts to negotiate a peace deal are contingent on the US securing extraction rights for Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. ”I said that if we want to move forward, we need rare earth metals,” he told Fox News. “We want our money back.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2026.

Then there is something that I have mentioned here before: if a price looks “wrong” to you, it is far more likely that you have missed something than it is that the entire market has got it wrong and you are right. Still, with all that said, I believe there is one very popular energy stock that should be shorted at current levels…Bloom Energy (BE). If you are a regular reader and have a long memory, you might remember that seven months ago, in June of last year, I recommended buying Bloom. I said then that their on-site fuel cell type generators stood out from the competition for a few reasons, and that they would appeal to companies building server and data centers as an alternative to depending on America’s somewhat creaky electric grid. That opinion has obviously become more mainstream, based on what has happened to BE since I wrote that piece… Back then, BE was trading at around $20, a far cry from the $150 that it touched this week. I said in June that buying and holding the stock for a few years might be smart, but I really didn’t see it jumping this far, this fast. That has come as the company has consistently beaten estimates for everything: EPS, revenue, and growth. On that basis, and given the potential that is still there, the move up makes sense. However, looking at the numbers, it seems to have gone too far, too fast. Growth stocks often have high P/Es, but BE’s trailing multiple of just under 1,900 is way beyond high. I get it, they are growing, but not that quickly! For context, Amazon (AMZN), probably the ultimate growth stock that went on to dominate multiple industries and sectors, has a historical high P/E of 563 in December of 2015. The forward P/E looks a little more reasonable, at around 175, at least until you realize that that is after just about every analyst that covers the stock has scrambled to raise their estimates significantly. My overall view of BE’s prospects hasn’t changed that much since June, but do you really think that they will turn out to be three or four times more dominant or more profitable than Amazon on a comparative basis? I guess they could, but it is unlikely, to say the least. Even if they eventually do, that is a long way off, and current pricing suggests that it is imminent. This is a case of one stock becoming the poster child for a compelling investment theme…powering the AI transition and getting massively overbought as a result. So, having bought at just above $20 back in June, I am now selling, and not just squaring up my position. The move is so overdone that I am actively shorting BE as well, even though it goes against both my nature and my learned risk aversion. To access this exclusive content...

Title: BitGo kicks off what could be a huge year for IPOs
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/23/bitgo-kicks-off-huge-year-ipos/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T14:20:26Z

UPDATED 09:20 EST / JANUARY 23 2026 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof In the first big initial public offering of 2026, the crypto platform BitGo shot out of the gate fast as initial trading jumped 25% over the offering price. Investors took a deep breath later, but the stock still rose almost 3% on the day — which means it raised about as much as it could. John Furrier covered it like a glove from the NYSE floor, including many interviews with BitGo and its partners. More IPOs could be coming too, not just from crypto companies such as Kraken and Ledger, but from artificial intelligence bellwethers such as Anthropic and OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Starlink and (maybe!) data giant Databricks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks that not only is there no bubble in artificial intelligence, but we actually need even more investment. 👀 Well, at least for now, most people agree, in particular investors who continue to plough plenty of dough into both AI chipmakers such as Furiosa AI, Upscale AI and AheadComputing, and all the AI companies that will need them, such as Anthropic, Humans&, China’s Moonshot AI, inference startup Baseten, Databricks and more. No slowdown in 2026, that’s for sure. If you want to know what’s coming in data and AI this year, don’t miss the latest Breaking Analysis from Dave Vellante and his panel of data experts. There’s a whole lot here, but one takeaway is that the agentic AI era will make data all the more important — in particular contextual data, meaning intelligence — and the cost of not doing it right will be steep. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking to take on Elon Musk’s Starlink with an enterprise-focused ultra-fast satellite internet play called TeraWave. Competition is good. After watching its stock keep rising for much of the past year thanks to AI infrastructure demand and government help, Intel stumbled a bit with its latest earnings — in particular its guidance, which came in light. Next week brings some big earnings reports: Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Meta, Samsung, SAP, ServiceNow, ASML, Tesla and more. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE, theCUBE Research and beyond: 2026 data predictions: Scaling AI agents via contextual intelligence Nvidia CEO says AI needs more investment in defiance of bubble fears (per WSJ) OK, Jensen… but it’s pretty apparent this is some kind of a bubble, which means winners and losers. Anthropic boss Dario Amodei slams Trump over ‘crazy’ decision to sell advanced AI chips to China CEOs say AI is making work more efficient. Employees tell a different story (per Wall Street Journal) Palantir CEO says AI will eliminate the need for mass immigration Some of these tech titans are just kind of weird, or maybe just opportunistic.

US-based tech and e-commerce giant Amazon is planning a second round of job cuts next week, as part of its broader goal of trimming its workforce by 30,000, according to news agency Reuters. In October last year, the company slashed around 14,000 white-collar jobs, which accounted for roughly half of Amazon's 30,000 target. This time though, the total layoffs are expected to be roughly the same as last year and could begin as soon as Tuesday, the agency report said. The reduction in roles will impact multiple departments across the Jeff Bezos-owned company. This marks one of the major layoffs happening at the start of the new year, indicating that last year's job-cut spree has continued into 2026. The mass layoffs are expected to impact employees who are serving in the company's Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources divisions, known as People Experience and Technology, said people aware of the development, although the full scope remains unclear. The sources further cautioned that the plan is not yet final, and the details could change, the agency reported. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the company's corporate workforce. The majority of Amazon’s workers are employed in fulfillment centers and warehouses. This move would also mark the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The last time it trimmed such a massive number of jobs was in 2022, where around 27,000 employees were affected. During the job cuts in October, the online retailer cited the rise of artificial intelligence software as a key reason for the decision. However, CEO Andy Jassy later told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Jassy also noted that “it’s culture,” meaning the company has too much bureaucracy, referring to the layoffs. “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he added. He had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to undergo a reduction over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the integration of AI in its workforce. Corporations are rapidly integrating AI into their software development lifecycles, moving beyond simple code autocompletion to adopting autonomous AI agents that can plan, execute, and debug code. This shift is driven by the need for increased productivity, cost reduction, and faster outputs, according to multiple reports.

DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine is nearing a “humanitarian catastrophe” after months of Russian airstrikes on energy systems and any future peace deal must include a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, the head of Ukraine’s largest private power producer said. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an “energy terror” campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems. The capital Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities say, and Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go. “We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on the energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?” Ukraine has endured two weeks of temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities. Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used in the interests of Ukraine’s armed forces. “We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe,” Timchenko said. “People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already.” He said Ukraine was holding on thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity. DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets. “We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction,” he said. U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country. Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and missiles, he said. “We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today,” he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences. (Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Mark Heinrich) DAVOS, Svizzera, 23 gennaio (Reuters) - L’Ucraina si sta avvicinando a una “catastrofe umanitaria” dopo mesi di attacchi aerei russi contro i sistemi energetici e qualsiasi futuro accordo di pace deve includere la cessazione degli attacchi alle infrastrutture energetiche, ha detto il capo del più grande produttore privato di energia elettrica dell’Ucraina. Maxim Timchenko, amministratore delegato di DTEK, ha dichiarato che la Russia - che ha lanciato un’invasione su larga scala dell’Ucraina quasi quattro anni fa - sta conducendo una campagna di “terrore energetico” dall’ottobre 2025, colpendo le centrali elettriche e travolgendo i sistemi di difesa aerea. La capitale Kiev e le regioni circostanti sono tra le più colpite, dicono le autorità, e il sindaco di Kiev ha esortato i residenti ad andarsene temporaneamente se hanno un altro posto dove andare. “Abbiamo bisogno di un cessate il fuoco sull’energia. Un cessate il fuoco sugli asset energetici”, ha detto Timchenko. “Come si può parlare di pace e continuare ad attaccare la gente, sapendo che la gente sta congelando? Come possono queste cose andare in parallelo?” L’Ucraina ha sopportato due settimane di temperature tra i meno 15 e i meno 20 gradi Celsius, ha detto, con la Russia che ha colpito le strutture di trasporto, stoccaggio e produzione del gas. La Russia afferma di aver preso di mira le infrastrutture militari ed energetiche utilizzate nell’interesse delle forze armate ucraine. “Siamo vicini a una catastrofe umanitaria”, ha detto Timchenko. “La gente riceve la corrente per 3-4 ore, poi una pausa di 10-15 ore. Ci sono condomini senza riscaldamento già da settimane”. Ha detto che l’Ucraina sta resistendo grazie alle importazioni di gas, anche dagli Stati Uniti, mentre gli attacchi hanno costretto le centrali a gas, carbone e idroelettriche a funzionare al di sotto della loro capacità. DTEK ha perso il 60-70% della sua capacità di generazione e ha subito danni per centinaia di milioni di dollari. Timchenko ha detto che la ricostruzione del settore energetico costerebbe 65-70 miliardi di dollari, citando le stime della Banca Mondiale, e in molti casi richiederebbe impianti completamente nuovi. “Stiamo parlando piuttosto di costruire un nuovo sistema energetico in Ucraina piuttosto che di una semplice ricostruzione”, ha dichiarato. Il gestore di patrimoni statunitense BlackRock è emerso negli ultimi giorni come la forza principale dietro un piano statunitense-ucraino per contribuire alla progettazione di un piano di ricostruzione per il Paese. L’Ucraina deve accelerare la costruzione di generazione decentralizzata, ha detto Timchenko, compresi nuovi progetti solari, parchi verdi e stoccaggio. Il decentramento significa che le risorse saranno più difficili da colpire da droni e missili, ha detto. “Non possiamo contare sulla firma di un accordo di pace. Dobbiamo iniziare a prepararci oggi”, ha detto, aggiungendo che l’Ucraina deve rifornirsi di attrezzature critiche e rafforzare le difese aeree.

The plan would give ultra-high net worth clients an in-house crypto on-ramp at one of the world's biggest private banks. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update Jan. 26, 2026, at 7:00 am UTC: This article has been updated to include a statement from a spokesperson at UBS. One of the world’s biggest global wealth managers, UBS, is reportedly exploring a move to open crypto trading to its wealthiest clients. Bloomberg reported Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that the Swiss banking giant aims to let select private banking clients in Switzerland trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) first, with a possible rollout to the Asia‑Pacific region and the United States later. The person also reportedly said that UBS was currently selecting partners for its crypto offering, although the bank has not publicly confirmed the details. UBS already runs tokenization pilots such as the uMINT tokenized US dollar money market fund on Ethereum and a Swift-UBS-Chainlink tokenized fund settlement trial, experimenting with putting traditional fund products on blockchain rails even before considering offering spot crypto trading. UBS has also deepened its blockchain push on the payments side, teaming up with Ant International to trial tokenized deposits for real-time cross-border treasury flows using its UBS Digital Cash platform in Singapore. The pilot aims to let Ant move liquidity across its Alipay+ ecosystem in minutes instead of days by putting bank deposit claims on permissioned ledgers, positioning tokenized bank money as a potential replacement for legacy, cutoff‑bound correspondent banking rails. Related: Bank of America lets wealth advisers recommend Bitcoin ETFs The Swiss group would be following US banking giant JPMorgan, which is exploring crypto trading for institutional clients and already uses its JPM Coin system for onchain wholesale payments and collateral, and asset management behemoths BlackRock and Fidelity, which have become leading issuers of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Vanguard, long one of Wall Street’s most vocal crypto skeptics, effectively became one of the last major holdouts to fold when it reversed its hardline stance in December 2025 and allowed clients to trade crypto ETFs on its platform. UBS oversaw some $4.7 trillion in wealth assets as of September 2025. If it moves ahead with crypto trading, the bank will open a new, in‑house on‑ramp for ultra‑high net worth portfolios. UBS declined to comment on the news, but a spokesperson told Cointelegraph that, as part of UBS’s digital asset strategy, the company “actively monitors developments and explores initiatives that reflect client needs, regulatory developments, market trends and robust risk controls.” The spokesperson added that UBS “recognized the importance of distributed ledger technology like blockchain.” Magazine: When privacy and AML laws conflict — Crypto projects’ impossible choice FOLLOW US © Cointelegraph 2013 - 2026 COINTELEGRAPH NEWSLETTER MOBILE APPS Cointelegraph covers fintech, blockchain and Bitcoin bringing you the latest crypto news and analyses on the future of money.

Title: Trump steals the show in Davos with a mixed bag of rhetoric and results at elite gathering
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/23/trump-steals-show-davos-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T13:47:36Z
Full Content:
By JAMEY KEATEN, Associated Press DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump took center stage in his whirlwind visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, overshadowing the yearly gabfest among national leaders, executives and other elites in the Swiss Alpine snows. While some experts highlighted business leaders’ ambitions to leverage AI for productivity, efficiency and profits or a boom in renewable energy investment led by China, Trump largely stole the show when it came to politics. Climate and other concerns didn’t draw the same attention as in past years at the event that ended Friday. “I think there were two Davoses,” said Jane Harman, a former Democratic Congresswoman. “One of them was very senior industrial leaders talking about AI. … The second was foreign policy, or geopolitics, and that was dominated by one person.” On his third visit to Davos while president, Trump came and went over about 24 hours. He delivered a rambling and at times hyperbolic speech that touted America’s global role. Unlike his previous trips to Davos among adoring corporate chiefs, Trump faced criticism from the likes of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who repeatedly spoke to media scrums in the Congress Center. Still, others were more congratulatory: NATO chief Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with Trump in Davos, praised his efforts to help end Russia’s war in Ukraine, boost Western defense and deliver security guarantees to Kyiv. One narrative that emerged in Davos: The U.S. under Trump and its Western allies have grown too divided. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke of a “rupture” that would never be repaired. In the runup to his trip to Davos, Trump sowed new discord with America’s longtime allies in Europe by announcing plans to set new tariffs on eight European countries who opposed his takeover bid for Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of NATO member Denmark. By Wednesday, amid an uproar at home and abroad, Trump had backed off in a dramatic reversal — not long after insisting he wanted to get the island “including right, title and ownership.” In a post on his social media site, Trump said he had agreed with NATO chief Rutte on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security, potentially defusing tension that had far-reaching geopolitical implications. Trump launched his Board of Peace to spearhead efforts at maintaining a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas, and eventually help underpin efforts to map a future of the war-torn Gaza Strip. The idea drew support from countries as diverse as Belarus, Kosovo, Indonesia and Argentina, but critics — including longtime U.S. allies in Europe — oppose it. They reject his claim that it could rival the United Nations one day. Some critics said details were scarce about how the Board of Peace will work — under the chairmanship of Trump himself — and suggested the better move would be to reinforce and improve current U.N. structures, not replace them. “I think they were trying to duplicate — replicate — what happened when the United Nations came about,” Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in an interview. “But frankly it was a very poor and sad attempt to repeat what happened in the 1940s.” Artificial intelligence was — as usual in recent times — a hot topic: Billionaire Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made their Davos debuts. Musk, who had previously called the WEF event “boring,” jetted in with little advance notice to discuss robotics, address AI’s electricity demands and gently rebuke the Trump administration for imposing tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Huang pushed back on fears that the AI boom might wipe out jobs, saying it would create work for people building out its infrastructure, such as “plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers and network technicians.” The U.S.-China rivalry got a mention from another AI chieftain: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei compared the Trump administration’s move to green-light sales of an advanced Nvidia chip to selling nuclear weapons to Pyongyang. But overall, it was can-do optimism among technology, AI and other business executives encapsulated the stated motto and mindset of the forum to improve the world and promote dialogue — not fear and doom-and-gloom predictions about the future. “I want to end this forum with the quote that Elon Musk said in closing yesterday’s session — that it’s better to be an optimist and wrong than be a pessimist who’s right,” said forum co-chair Larry Fink, the BlackRock chairman and CEO, at the closing ceremony. Associated Press writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

January 23, 2026 08:27 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to recent data from Astute Analytica, the global food safety testing market was valued at US$ 21.24 billion in 2024 and is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 44.74 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 8.63% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The food safety testing market is being propelled forward by a pressing and sobering reality: the high incidence of foodborne illnesses worldwide. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that one in every six Americans falls victim to foodborne illnesses each year. This translates to roughly 48 million cases annually, with devastating consequences that include approximately 3,000 deaths. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/food-safety-testing-market The widespread prevalence of foodborne illnesses has galvanized regulatory agencies and industry leaders alike to intensify their focus on food safety. Regulatory bodies have responded by enforcing stricter standards and mandating comprehensive testing protocols designed to detect contaminants at every stage of the food supply chain—from production and processing to distribution and retail. Cutting-Edge Technologies Reshaping Food Safety Testing Technological advancements in food safety testing methodologies are revolutionizing how contaminants are detected, dramatically improving both accuracy and efficiency. Among the most impactful innovations are DNA-based techniques and rapid testing methods, which have transformed traditional testing paradigms. These state-of-the-art approaches enable food safety professionals to identify pathogens and chemical hazards with unprecedented precision, often delivering results within hours rather than days. DNA-based testing methodologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have become indispensable tools in the fight against foodborne illnesses. By targeting the genetic material of pathogens, these techniques offer highly specific and sensitive detection, capable of identifying even low levels of contamination that might elude conventional methods. Rapid testing technologies complement DNA-based methods by providing quick and dependable results directly at points of production or distribution. Techniques such as immunoassays, biosensors, and portable diagnostic devices empower food producers and regulators to conduct on-site testing with minimal delay. This immediacy allows for real-time decision-making and swift corrective actions, reducing the likelihood of contaminated products reaching consumers. Contract Research Organizations: Pillars of the Food Safety Testing Ecosystem Contract Research Organizations (CROs) have become indispensable players in the global food safety testing market, serving as specialized partners that address the complex and evolving needs of the food industry. By 2024, over 1,000 CROs worldwide will be providing a wide spectrum of food safety testing services, highlighting the industry’s growing dependence on these expert third-party providers. CROs cater to a broad range of testing requirements, adapting to the multifaceted challenges of modern food production and distribution. As food supply chains become increasingly global and intricate, the demand for precise and timely testing has surged. These organizations bring specialized expertise and advanced technologies to the table, enabling food companies to comply with stringent safety regulations and respond rapidly to potential contamination risks. A striking example of the CRO sector’s growth and sophistication is Boston University’s high-throughput clinical testing laboratory, which processed an impressive 45,000 food and clinical tests weekly in 2024. This achievement underscores the widespread adoption of automation and high-capacity testing systems within the industry. Such innovations enable CROs to deliver faster, more accurate results, meeting the urgent need for speed and precision in food safety testing. Microbial Testing: The Cornerstone of Food Safety Microbial testing holds a commanding 36% share of the global food safety testing market, reflecting its critical role in detecting and preventing foodborne illnesses. As pathogens continue to spark high-profile food recalls, the importance of microbial analysis has only deepened. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that contaminated foods were responsible for 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for rigorous microbial surveillance and intervention. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exemplifies this heightened vigilance, processing a record 1.2 million microbial assays in 2024—an increase of 140,000 samples compared to 2023. This surge highlights the expanding scope of microbial testing as a frontline defense against harmful pathogens. Across Asia, similar momentum is evident: Japan’s Ministry of Health conducted thorough examinations of 880,000 consignments following a Listeria outbreak in frozen vegetables, demonstrating rapid response capabilities. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed microbial testing, with rapid molecular tools like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays becoming fundamental to routine inspections. Thermo Fisher Scientific’s shipment of 5.4 billion PCR reactions worldwide in 2024 is a telling indicator of this trend—enough to screen every kilogram of exported meat twice over. These molecular techniques enable faster, more precise detection of pathogens compared to traditional methods, allowing for quicker interventions and reducing the risk of contaminated products reaching consumers. Data-Driven Revolution: Transforming Food Safety Risk Assessment The integration of data-driven methodologies is reshaping the landscape of food safety risk assessment, marking a pivotal shift in how professionals identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential hazards. Traditional approaches are giving way to sophisticated technologies that leverage advanced data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). These tools process massive datasets drawn from diverse sources—ranging from historical testing records and supply chain logistics to environmental monitoring and even social media trends—providing a holistic view of food safety risks. The power of machine learning and AI lies in their ability to uncover complex patterns and correlations within seemingly unrelated data points, turning raw information into actionable insights. These technologies facilitate continuous learning and adaptation, improving risk assessments over time as new data flows in. Consequently, food safety professionals can make more informed decisions, prioritize resources effectively, and minimize the likelihood of foodborne illnesses. North America: A Vanguard in Food Safety Testing and Recall Management North America continues to lead the global food safety testing market, driven by a stringent regulatory framework and a proactive stance on managing food recalls. The United States, under the combined oversight of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), managed an estimated 296 to 300 food recalls in 2024. These recalls were predominantly triggered by undeclared allergens and contamination from pathogens such as Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli—hazards that pose significant risks to public health. Parallel to the U.S., Canada’s Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued 89 food safety advisories within the same timeframe, reflecting a similarly vigilant approach to protecting public health. These advisories demonstrate the region’s commitment to early detection and swift response to potential food safety threats, reinforcing North America’s reputation for rigorous oversight and consumer protection in the food supply chain. The regulatory environment in North America is characterized not only by aggressive recall management but also by the widespread adoption of advanced food testing technologies. While annual assay volumes remain confidential, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) alone performed more than 1.2 million laboratory tests on meat, poultry, and egg products in 2024. This highlights the scale and intensity of testing efforts to ensure food safety. The region boasts a strong laboratory network, including over 1,200 CLIA-certified food safety testing laboratories across the U.S., complemented by an increasing number of in-house testing facilities within food manufacturing plants, enabling rapid and precise quality control.

Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson expects to continue laying off employees as part of its ongoing cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Ekholm was quoted as saying in a post-earnings call by Reuters. Earlier this year, Ericsson announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at ensuring the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. These cost-saving measures have helped the company maintain profitability and deliver strong earnings, even as telecom operators continue to witness sluggish demand in the global 5G equipment market. In mid-January, Ericsson submitted a notice to the Swedish Public Employment Service, stating that approximately 1,600 positions could be impacted in the country. It also initiated negotiations with relevant trade unions. The telecom equipment maker has been working to cut costs and improve margins in recent years. The company struggled with weak demand, as anticipated carrier spending on 5G technology did not meet expectations, Mint reported earlier. Ericsson has been steadily reducing headcount over the last three years to maintain profitability as it grappled with 5G spending slowdown and the widespread impact of sweeping US tariffs. In 2023, the company announced a global plan to cut 8,500 jobs, equivalent to 8% of its workforce. The reductions have continued since then, with the company axing hundreds of staff in Spain and Canada last year. Ericsson is not the first company to reduce its headcount, as at least five other major companies have also announced layoffs in January this year, reflecting a broader trend of cost-cutting across the corporate sector. The job-loss trend that companies struggled with the previous year seems to have continued into the new year as well. Earlier, BlackRock said it planned to cut hundreds of jobs this month, after Meta announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the Digital Labs division. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report also said Meta's job cuts are expected later this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Banking major Citigroup is also about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company, Mint reported. In a more recent instance, Amazon also announced that it plans to slash around 30,000 white-collar jobs by next week. It said the layoffs may impact AWS, HR, Prime Video and retail segments of the company. However, the plans may still change, said a Mint report.

This is at best a peripheral topic and yet they wanted this sorted out on behalf of Blackrock and forget negotiating ending the war. Amateurs. “No diplomatic breakthrough”? I’m shocked! Shocked! / ;) I second that comment. They send the bird of a business feather K. Dimitriv to talk with them.

It’s 2026 and… If the WHO now concedes, as the letter urges, that airborne transmission is central and that respirators are materially superior, then every state that continues to permit surgical masks as default clinical protection exposes itself to claims that it is breaching its duty of care to healthcare workers and patients alike. The implications under European human rights law are immediate. I think I can hear Lambert Strether clearing his throat. Storm tips: also fill the bathtub for washing and flushing toilet. Fill largest pots/teakettles etc with water for drinking. Good tips. Also, if you kitchen or bathroom sinks are against an outside wall of your house keep a tiny thin stream of water running and open the under sink cabinet doors to let house heat warm the pipes. This keeps the those water pipes from freezing up and possibly bursting. Don’t forget to stock up on supplies for any cats and dogs that you have. And if push comes to shove, they make great hot water bottles for your bed. If you have a camp stove, but couldn’t get the standard green bottles of camp stove propane before it sold out, propane “torch” canisters work exactly the same and were, at least yesterday, still in stock in the Richmond, VA metro region at both big box hardware stores and small scale hardware stores. She Criticized the Mayor’s Support for Israel on Facebook. Then the Cops Showed Up at Her Door. The Intercept ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Its so bad out there, the other day I was at a farmers market in Visalia and remarked to a seller in one of the booths that I didn’t really like Jerusalem Artichokes, and almost immediately out of nowhere was put in a choke hold by some goon using a yarmulke as an impromptu face mask and admonished that talk like that would not be tolerated anywhere in the land of the free and home of the brave. You aren’t that far off of reality despite the jest, which is the astounding thing. Everywhere one cares to look across the “West” it’s censorship and suppression of speech, all in the service of the genocidal state. The latest news re:TikTok “””sale””” is case in point, where supposedly it was sold but the valuation makes it essentially stealing from the Chinese: TikTok’s long-running US saga ends with a deal that averts a ban Vice President JD Vance, whose former firm, Revolution, participated in the deal, has said the new US venture is valued at about $14 billion. That figure marks the highest public estimate tied directly to government disclosures, although analysts previously placed TikTok’s broader US business – advertising, e-commerce, and live streaming – at between $35 billion and $50 billion. That’s some ‘deal’ right there…more like a NexPeria type heist, American-Israeli style. You will find the Western lamestream media stenographers keep dutifully claiming the sale was necessary for American national security, while the cabal behind the heist openly talk about why it was necessary for Israeli interests: (Dec 21 2025) Anti-Palestinian Billionaires Can Now Control What TikTok Users See The TikTok deal announced on Thursday poses a fundamental threat to free and honest discourse about Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Under the reported deal, the Chinese company that owns the short-video social media app, ByteDance, will transfer control of TikTok’s algorithm and other U.S. operations to a new consortium of investors led by the U.S. technology company Oracle. The long-gestating deal will give Oracle’s billionaire pro-Trump board members Larry Ellison and Safra Catz the power to impose their anti-Palestinian agenda over the content that TikTok users see. ….. Ellison and Catz have a documented record of supporting Israel and its military …. Catz, who stepped down as Oracle’s CEO in September, has also been quite blunt about the company’s ideological agenda. The Israeli American billionaire said while unveiling a new Oracle data center in Jerusalem in 2021, “I love my employees, and if they don’t agree with our mission to support the State of Israel then maybe we aren’t the right company for them. Larry and I are publicly committed to Israel and devote personal time to the country, and no one should be surprised by that.” The Ellison family has also brought his pro-Israel agenda to CBS News, where Larry’s son, David Ellison, recently installed anti-Palestinian ideologue Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief. …. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that he understands the consequences of access to unfiltered social media. He recently described the sale of TikTok as “the most important purchase happening. … I hope it goes through because it can be consequential.” Netanyahu, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in Gaza, sees control of TikTok as a part of Israel’s military strategy. “You have to fight with the weapons that apply to the battlefield, and one of the most important ones is social media,” he continued. The Netanyahu video in question, as noted by r/China watchers on reddit: Wow, Netanyahu blatantly discusses buying Tiktok for propaganda And an article on his comments to online ‘influencers’: TikTok sale could be ‘consequential’ for Israel, Jews, Netanyahu tells influencers Its so weird at present, that I expect gentiles will soon be required to wear a Star of David on their clothes, in order to not be singled out as an anti-Semite. Have things really changed? I remember visiting my sister in NYC almost 15 years ago when I said to her that Israel is an apartheid state. We were having lunch at the time in a restaurant and my sister reacted with almost panic. She looked around hurriedly, leaned over and said in an urgent whisper that I couldn’t say such things in NYC. She is not at all political but having lived there for a few years was already well versed in right speak. > We ran high-level US civil war simulations. Minnesota is exactly how they start The Guardian >> Minnesota may be the first test of whether constitutional limits on domestic military force still hold – or whether the United States is about to cross a line from which it cannot easily return. From The emergence of categorical norms: > Why do incursions on a territory of little strategic or economic significance (e.g., the Falkland Islands, or the disputed islands in the South China Sea) invite full-scale retaliation and risk war? Why do nations not retaliate only when the incursion is sufficiently meaningful? If retaliation is modeled as punishment in a repeated game, then punishment is incentivized by the need to deter similar transgressions, which involves coordination, namely on what counts as similar and what type of transgression will incur retaliation. Under these assumptions, it is not possible for retaliation to be triggered by the significance of the incursion–a continuous variable–but only by the presence of an incursion–a categorical variable. ICE has added a new harassment for violence observers: https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/ice-making-list-of-anyone-who-films just curious if any of y’all wonder the same thing – is this fascist push in Minnesota to actually incur an armed response to ICE in order to use the insurrection act and throw a wet blanket over 2026 elections??? re: The Monstrous Confessions Of Mark Carney – Nate Bear Thanks for that link. Very good. I’m left thinking of this old nursery rhyme: There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house. agree with Nate and thankful for the succinct observation – i make it a point to keep my blood pressure down for medical reasons and do not listen to “leaders” speeches – a very close Chicago friend who is from Belgium and who disagrees often with me mentioned i should listen or at least read a text of his speech – i read a text and found it beyond disturbing at the admission of the criminal hegemony participated in and profited from – and that this mea culpa meant forgiveness? – there was no suggestion of solutions, just different partnerships as the good ship hegemony continues on its course – may Carney rot in a hell – although that’s a pipe dream, which reminds me i should pour some cognac and light a pipefull, sometimes it feels like the only way to stop shaking my head in disgust and disbelief – when my Belgian friend ask what i thought I asked her how the weather was in Chicago – Carney just another judas goat for the masses – https://www.agweb.com/news/livestock/beef/judas-goats-agricultures-bizarre-drug-addicted-masters-deceit-once-ruled-killing-floor The blood pressure thing is real; I find myself having to take a break from the news sometimes because it, and our so-called “elite” leaders, are simply rage-inducing, quite literally for me. The sheer criminality, and the increasingly dysfunctional natures of western society as it degrades and they don’t even bother to hide things anymore…it’s quite something. Take care out there. YESSSSSS – had an aortic valve replacement and take lisinopril to keep pressure under control I’ve never heard the word “historic” used to mean “what used to happen all the time” before. “This is all-time historic vintage cold” Meh. I remember January 1977 ,,, I was just a kid, but Buffalo went the entire month without getting above freezing, and the cold air pushed so far south that it snowed on Miami Beach. All-time would technically include pre-history, when humans weren’t around to record events, so yeah, that’s some bad headlining that needed an editor. Oh I’ve seen it all over the place, journalists being the parrots that they are. I honestly don’t get the mentality since they are surely aware and many presumably remember that such storms happened a lot more often 10 or 20 years ago. I remember in VA an icicle as thick as my head blocking the entire front door from opening. When I first moved to NYC a decade ago I remember multi foot snow, nothing remotely like that happens any more. I guess they just reflexively use such language to sell clicks but its irritating. I remember this. There was going to be an orange juice shortage. Fifteen year old me was horrified at the thought of losing a major component of my food pyramid. Stay warm, don’t leave your car under the canopy! I remember January 1977, had airdrifts piled up all the way into the mesosphere in LA. oh the humanity! I don’t think it was more than 10 years ago when we had a spell of winter weather where the temperature didn’t get out of the low single digits for a month, and below zero every night. I remember telling a friend about skiing in a 16 degree “heat wave” that practically felt like summer. I was a high schooler in rochester then and we were blanketed good but not as bad as buffalo I think. Cross country skiing to school was fun, once in a while some skeeching but watch out for those manhole covers. I had a 6 kid toboggan and we’d go to cobbs hill and it was the greatest. The funny thing I learned about that “blizzard” was that the actual snow fall total wasn’t that much… a few inches. The thing was Lake Erie was totally frozen over and the high winds picked up all that lite snow sitting on the ice and dropped it on western NY to accumulate there in feet! Lol, I’m sure to be mulling this over while I’m trying to thaw the kitchen pipes with my blow-dryer. @Amfortas, thinking you’re under this storm’s gun, don’t forget the rv antifreeze for the toilet. There is money to be made in middle class anxiety. Its why I don’t watch local news anymore. Probably one of the best movies about TV news (outside of Network) is Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Chilling to the bone… It’s what the world of Network has wrought. If you guys are wondering where all the heat has gone, we have it parked over here- https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/23/intense-heat-across-south-east-australia-could-shatter-temperature-records-in-coming-days For people who either weren’t around then or have really short memories, Winter of 1977-78 enters the chat. In Kentucky, we were slammed by relentless amounts of heavy wet snow from basically the end of December into early February. I was in high school at the time and we missed from Christmas Break to around Valentine’s Day before roads were clear enough to go back to school. The station whose signal we could pick up the best had a weather person who was showing real signs of mental distress at having to give daily reports of more heavy snow and bitter cold. My parents’ house was out in the county and trying to keep our fairly long driveway shoveled enough for my dad to get in and out to get to work felt like something Sisyphus would appreciate. The road crew guys trying to keep the roads plowed no doubt felt the same. I remember other winters not quite this epic, but also very cold with lots of heavy snow through the 1980’s up to 2003 where we got insane amounts of ice instead of snow. I think we had something like 20 snow days in Buffalo that year. We were doing make-up days into late June. As a kid it was fun having entire weeks off from school. No darn virtual schooling, thank God! We also did make up days into mid to late June. Since I didn’t live in town, the remoteness was starting to wear thin by the time we got into February. They are totally out of control with the hype, at least for some areas. I’m in Rochester, NY and they are saying it’s going to be “Dangerously Cold” today. The high is 14 degrees. That’s not an uncommon temperature for January here. We’re forecast to be well above zero for the next week. It’s bad when it’s below zero for days and that’s not in the forecast. It’s basically click bate weather these days. I’ll give your weatherman a pass on this one because Rochester, NY has a world class university. There are probably many students, some of them freshmen, who are from milder or even tropical climates. They need the warning. I remember seeing a car load of students apparently from a southern locale in my uni town whose car got stuck in the snow on a bitterly cold, sub-zero, January day. 3 of them got out of the car to push it, and not one was wearing anything warmer than what I’d call a light windbreaker. Not a winter coat or caps and gloves in sight. I grew up in Michigan and moved to a warmer climate. It was years before I could leave the house without a jacket even on a nice day. It was in my bones that the weather could turn vicious with little notice. Yep. I’m sure you’ve seen this old cartoon. https://www.sikhu.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Weather-in-Michigan-Cartoon.jpg The Weather Channel naming snowstorms as if they were hurricanes was a major step backward for me. Locally, the models and actors posing as meteorologists on a local TV news outlet are collectively billed as “Stormwatch Team.” I thought, why not “Weather Watch Team”? Because we’re not supposed to be compelled by forecasts of nonviolent weather. This is weather porn. For Central Virginia, we are looking at something that could indeed be catastrophic. Temps in the 60’s are not uncommon in Richmond in January. Once or twice a year, we get a day that doesn’t get above freezing. What we have coming our way this weekend is on another level. It’s not the snow but the half inch to one inch of ice. That will put the power out for many, including my family, as a near certainty and make travel completely impossible between iced roads and fallen trees. But what is following the ice is what is so extraordinary. My local 7-10 day forecasts are not predicting a single day getting above freezing between now and next weekend. So a half inch of ice and power outages means thousands and thousands of homes with frozen pipes. For potentially a week. I know northerners scoff at highs in the upper 20s, but my home is not insulated for a week with highs in the twenties and lows in the single digits for a week steady. We have a heat pump; not gas or a furnace. I am much better set up for those days when it’s 102* in the sun. Now those oak trees that shade my home in July are major threats to my house on Sunday. So, please do spare a thought for some of us. My family is looking at some very very hard days ahead of us, despite all the preparations I have tried to make. A few things. If you expect the power out for several days charge up your phones. Buy some candles. But batterys for flashlights. Keep a weak stream of water running in all the faucets, if you’re a camper and have a portable tent (yes, this sounds silly but it works), set up the tent or improvise one out of blankets and clothes pins for sleeping quarters. Shared body heat is a real thing. Cook some food ahead of time that can be stored in the fridge and eaten cold. There’s one big Do Not. Do not use a kerosene or gas or bottled gas space heater. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious danger. Best of luck. To be clear: set up the tent inside your house, not outside. Use the living room for camping in the great indoors. / ;) Yes, ice storms are a different matter. Good luck with it. Prepare well. “Armada”, hmm, history often rhymes. In the headlines on the consumer electronics front (and a bit of a Japan economy watch) is that Sony is looking to offload the majority of its TV and home entertainment business to Chinese TCL: Sony is selling its home entertainment business to TCL – but what does this mean for future Bravia TVs? Sony and TCL have announced that they are moving forward with discussions to establish a joint venture between the companies, which will see TCL assume control of Sony’s home entertainment business. The partnership is in early stages, with both companies signing a “memorandum of understanding to confirm their intentions to establish a joint venture that will assume Sony’s home entertainment business”. … In a statement shared by Sony, it confirmed that the joint operation will “operate globally”, and will ensure that TCL oversees “the full process from product development and design to manufacturing, sales, logistics, and customer service for products including televisions and home audio equipment”. Sony’s press site says they want to have the joint venture up and running in 2027. As this is an MOU nothing is set in stone yet, but if it goes through it will be historic for the Japanese consumer electronics industry that even the mighty Sony wants to throw in the towel on television manufacturing, a sector that was once considered something of a crown jewel in consumer electronics. This would be like the equivalent of Apple selling off its desktop and laptop division. I thought Sony would have kept it going somehow purely out of pride; they aren’t bleeding money on the TV division like in years past, when Samsung and LG came on the scene and LCD flatscreens price wars blew up the market, but they probably aren’t making all that much selling TVs anymore because prices on television sets have fallen astonishingly over the past 25 years: TV prices have fallen more than 90% since 2000, thanks to mass scale Television prices have fallen faster than almost any other consumer product over the past 25 years, a quiet but striking shift in the economics of home electronics. A closer look at the trend reveals a mix of manufacturing breakthroughs, scale effects, and intensifying competition, as once-budget brands steadily close the gap with long-dominant players. Sony still makes some of the best tv’s you can buy (along with Panasonic, see Vincent’s 2025 shootout ) but it is an utterly cutthroat business with thin margins, as are most consumer electronics nowadays with hungry Chinese juggernauts coming up fast. Sony was #5 worldwide as of 2024 with a 5.4% market share, which actually is pretty decent given that they mostly sell premium TVs. Aside from Sony, there is still Panasonic and Sharp (and somewhat Toshiba?) left of the Japanese brands still making TVs, and even these are mostly outsourced to other companies now given the thin margins. Sharp (the entire company) was bought by Foxxcon a few years back because of heavy losses, and Toshiba has sold off it’s TV division as well as most of its appliance division to Chinese companies. They all have minuscule global marketshares in televisions, a far cry from their heydays when Japan dominated the industry. Bit of a shame really, as I’ve always had something of a soft spot for anything Panasonic (AKA Matsushita). Japan also had Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Pioneer, JVC, Sanyo, Fujitsu, and probably even more companies I’ve never heard of making TVs at one point or another, just to give an idea how dominant their industry once was. Crazy how rapidly the tech world changes! Samsung is the largest maker of TVs globally today and has been for the past twenty years, but TCL will probably surpass them this year or next. Both Samsung and LG sold their last LCD panel factories to TCL (both the Korean makers kept their OLED panel factories), and Sharp wound down their last LCD panel factory in Sakai, Japan in 2024, meaning almost all large LCD TV panels (regardless of TV brand) today are made in China. Most companies source the actual display panels from third parties and build the rest of the TV themselves, even companies that made their own panels like Samsung and Sharp often source panels from others to target different sizes and tech display options. It is rather remarkable how quickly some of these Chinese companies grow and come to dominate their industry, even against other tough competition in Asia. Although in the display panel business there is always lots of talk about state subsidies giving the Chinese majors a big boost. Sony KDL-40EX720 here. Bought new in 2012, still using it, still looks great. sound quality? You don’t buy Sony tvs for sound quality, but the early 2010 models (I don’t know other years) could process all kinds of modern digital sound processes (DTS, etc.) so you could run the sound from a digital optical output in to an older receiver (i.e. one with digital optical BUT no HDMI) and it would sound incredible. I bought a similar model (EX line) in 2010 and it is still be used by my mother in her home as her daily watcher. We just run the sound through a Polk soundbar with subwoofer and it is decent. The upper tier Panasonic and Sony tv’s have actually put quite a bit of thought behind their sound systems to cater to folks who don’t want to hook their tvs up to external sound systems. Panasonic has woofers and upward+side-firing speakers on the Z95B and the W95A models, something like 50W speaker power total if I remember correctly? Even has Dolby Atmos somehow with that setup. The upper tier Sony TV’s have woofers as well as an interesting technology Sony calls “Acoustic Surface Audio”, which uses the entire panel surface area itself as a speaker. Not as good sounding as external units like yours will give you but pretty close! For us, it is Toshiba (is this brand still around — it isn’t on your list?). Our largish flat-screen set is 20+years old and is still working great — perfectly in fact. When it finally dies, we are assuming that whatever we replace it with (even if Toshiba is still available?) will be a downgrade. They made great laptops! I still have an old Toshiba Satellite somewhere here, that still worked last time I powered it up a few years ago. Toshiba itself was doing OK but was sunk by it’s ownership/investments into the nuclear arm of US Westinghouse, which Toshiba bought in 2005, and which ended up bleeding them dry throught the mid-2010s through delays, cost overruns and penalties. Things got so bad that Westinghouse itself had to declare bankruptcy in 2017 in what is known as the Nukegate scandal. That lead Toshiba to selling off most of its consumer electronics and appliance divisions to raise money to cover some of the losses. There’s a list of Toshiba’s business groups that were spun off on their website : Businesses transferred from Toshiba Group (Including Toshiba Brand licensed products ) Home Appliances (Toshiba Lifestyle Co., Ltd.) TV, Blu-ray and other visual products (TVS REGZA Corporation) Memory and SSDs (Kioxia Corporation) PC and Tablets (Dynabook Inc.) HVAC (Carrier Japan Corporation) You can see some of the carnage in all the corporate spinoffs (although Toshiba today is still huge, they make mostly commercial products now). The TV unit was bought by Hisense and they still seem to operate it as a separate unit to Hisense (“Toshiba Visual Solutions”), although Toshiba TVs today are built by Hisense in their own factories. And is it know which segments have kept old quality levels? p.s. I bought a new hand mixer and learned that only KRUPS – which has become part of a French consortium in the 2000s – has an older model still produced where the inside and the mountings for the egg whips are made of metal instead of plastic. It´s quite heavy to hold in your hand. But when the lady told me and immediately recommended only this particular one among a dozen other companies I bought it without looking further. KRUPS has a newer model but that has switched to all plastic too. So for now they got two different models. She pensively articulated hope that KRUPS would keep producing the older version. Well, buying the old (really old) models, if they are still in production, is often one of the easiest ways as you have found :) Being heavy is another one. Something built on an old production line can be not worth ‘updating’ so the bean counters that run everything don’t bother changing processes. You have to remember that modern companies are run under a relentless cost-cutting regime, they will move heaven and earth to save a few pennies per unit. If you ever watch engineering tear-downs by folks like Munro and associates (a fun video from them: German Engineering At Its Best: Tearing Down the New Volkswagen APP550 Electric Motor ), they will critique every single screw or fastener a company uses because it represents extra costs of production. Every extra bend, every extra casting piece, anything part that is three pieces but might have been able to do in one piece? Etc. Every dollar adds up when you’re building 200 000 units a year. Trying to guess the quality levels is difficult, and that’s why brands have ‘value’ to them in the first place, as that takes the guesswork out for potential buyers if that company has consistently well made products or if they produce garbage. A lot depends on company culture, if they are run by engineers versus finance people – I find American companies are the worst in this respect, epitomized by the Wall Street style bankster private equity types that will burn a company to the ground to raise profits. If you have people running things who care about the company’s or product’s reputation (like a lot of family owned German Mittelstand?), then the chances are better that the engineers will get more freedom to build it without taking a chainsaw to production costs. I think that is often times why Apple’s products were so good under Steve Jobs, because he was such a fussy leader and the bean counters, finance and investment people probably feared for their lives around him, haha. The best way to know is find someone that knows his stuff and does a tear down to analyze it. Youtubers like JerryRigEverything are good for this (for phones in his case). There are other channels that test things to failure (Project Farm) or test specs on things like tools (Torque Test Channel), so if you’re lucky the thing you want to buy might be on one of their channels being reviewed. Thanks! I have a TCL TV and it looks fine to me. It may be ten years old and didn’t cost much. My serious video watching is always via computer output where I have far more control. Sony reigned back during a pre digital age when the finer points of analog tube TVs mattered. Of course those DVD and earlier era TVs would seem quite primitive next to a 4k panel of today. Sony also pioneered with something called the Walkman. I doubt many younger people have even heard of it. That’s the interesting bit, Sony itself was amazingly innovative, even until fairly recently, and pioneered a lot of the technology we take for granted now (like first with lithium ion batteries – a division they later sold off in 2017). They were slow with LCD technology but were pioneers with OLED panels, releasing the worlds first OLED tv in 2007(!), but never seemed to be able to capitalize on their inventions like other companies managed to (LG and Samsung pushed OLED displays into the mainstream). Similarly with the cellphone, they bought Ericson’s cellphone division and just let it seemingly wither away (although I see that they are still making Xperia phones to this day, but they are hardly sold anywhere?). Sony was the model that Steve Jobs admired and wanted Apple to emulate at one point. A lot of similar shady business practices from the both of them, too! lol I never understood the LG logic. I found their surfaces and interfaces very complicated and overstuffed. I grew up on SONY. But at some point started to assume that that was a huge load of PR compensating for lack of real quality by the early 2000s. Don´t know if that was a correct assessment. But I started to look either in lower price segments or pricier ones depending on what I needed. And yes they were serious mafiosi as business practices are concerned. Ever since I understood that part of business success I started to doubt almost all of them. Their older stuff was definitely better put together. I think that is true for most Japanese electronics, the golden age was the mid 1970s until the bubble bursting in 1991, and China really taking over manufacturing in the latter 1990s. I have my dad’s old JVC stereo system from 1979 that still works perfectly, and a few other Panasonic, Toshiba, and Yamaha gizmos around the house that still work. Lots of it older than me, just incredible longevity. My university housemate had a Sony Trinitron TV his dad bought in the 1980s for the basement, and it was so well made it actually survived a flood! They found the thing so submerged it was practically floating in water; they took it upstairs and dried it out over two or three weeks, and much to their surprise it fired right up. Was disgustingly heavy too, bloody thing must have weighed at least 200 pounds haha. Not fun moving it 6 storeys up! Sony Trinitron TV I believe that was bought two or three times in our family. At one point I had to explain Dad that they are not being sold any more. But it was used so extensively that it broke after a decade every time. Am not sure if there weren´t theories that those very models had less longevity. Anyway that image quality has never been achieved since. At least judging from the screens I rarely happen to see nowadays. And the flatter and younger the models the worse. The first gen JVC flat-screen was still the best one we had. “Sony also pioneered with something called the Walkman. I doubt many younger people have even heard of it.” The following video gives an idea how fast mainstream, familiar consumer technologies fade away and disappear from the universe of recognizable objets. It is in French (Canada), but it should nevertheless be quite understandable. Notice that the video is already quite old (at least 15 years old). I reckon one of the objects presented was utterly foreign to me (I had never seen one before). Haha, great video ty :) In a similar vein to that, one of the more entertaining things on youtube is kids trying to figure out how to use old film cameras: KIDS REACT TO OLD CAMERAS A Tech Bro Think Tank Is Trying to Roll Back Evidence-Based Homelessness Policy Truthout ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Drove by a proposed new Careless Consumers Camp (CCC) the other day on Highway 395 just before Independence along the flanks of the eastern Sierra.

Scahill interview with Iranian photographer Notes from the Ground: Reflections on a Month That Shook Iran Kaveh Rostamkhani, a photographer and essayist, speaks to Drop Site about what he saw and felt over the past several weeks inside Iran 52 min. https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/interview-tehran-iran-protests-internet-blackout-israel-trump-pahlavi-riots Drop Site News seems to be trying to restore some balance in their coverage here, after Ryan Grim provided a platform for a very one-sided anti-regime narrative several days ago. Grim seemed genuinely taken aback by all the criticism these earlier appearances received, which threatened to tarnish the reputation Drop Site was building for its work on Gaza and Epstein. On that subject, I found the New Left review article ‘Scylla and Charybdis’ posted in today’s Links as similarly dismaying. Written by a left-leaning Oxford educated Westerner, Eskandar Sadeghi-Boroujerdi, it emphasized the brutality, unpopularity, corruption, incompetence, and even the neoliberalism of the government – which of course fits right in with the Western narrative. Again, it’s not that there isn’t truth behind these charges, but the larger context, including the effects of tremendous economic pressures and external destabilization efforts, were greatly downplayed in this piece in favor of regime criticism. This author has written about the latter effectively before; for example: https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/culmination But this current piece exhibits many of the characteristics of left-leaning Western academics who let their own ideological preferences cloud their analysis. For example, given the reforms he (and many Iranians) favor, he could have mentioned how every time reformist politicians and policies have gained traction in Iran they have been sabotaged by the West. He is correct about the symbiotic relationship between Iranian hard-liners and Western regime-change neocons. Yet much of this discussion provides cover for the latter. I was wondering what had happened – :-P ok, was about to read NLR… Apparently the Anarchist line of thinking in the left unfortunately makes many usually decent thinkers and commentators blind to harsh realities and they simply are unwilling to at least acknowledge that and learn to expand their horizon and include this new experience. As it now turns out this is one of the main obstacles for organizing within the left. Until 2022 I did not expect such a demise to take place. And since this is systemic within the intellectual tradition which they seemingly follow like a law of nature no hope for any change soon. So the rightwing march will go on without serious resistance at least from those quarters as usual in recent decades. Not in all areas and not in the same way and not everywhere. But it sure is an ontologic crisis in Western Europe. B on Moon of Alabama has picked up on NC and the NLR piece. A ‘Left’ Cover-Up Of Regime Change Failure Today’s daily Links page at Yves’ Naked Capitalism pointed to a piece about Iran published by Sidecar, the blog-site of the New Left Review. Neither NLR nor Sidecar are on my daily reading list though I have linked to several Sidecar piece in my Week-In-Review collection. According to its About page: The criteria for publication on Sidecar will be saying something – about persons, processes, events, structures – that is not being said elsewhere, but deserves to be. The Sidecar piece linked via Naked Capitalism, Scylla and Charybdis by Eskandar Sadeghi-Boroujerdi, certainly does NOT match that criteria. https://www.moonofalabama.org/2026/01/a-left-cover-up-of-regime-change-failure.html q.e.d. How is this incompetence of “left” on geopolitics possible? I remember well when I started shaking my head about NLR´s coverage of the War in early 2022. Susan Watkins or Volodymyr Ishchenko and others. Not that everything was wrong but it was a striking lack of overall grasp due to ideology. Almost a helpless search for orientation. Dunno if they have altered some views or recovered from the initial shock. The way to a certain extent I dare speculate Craig Murray, for instance, has. Thanks. I think the MoA take-down is spot on. Especially effective is the contrast between this view from the “left” and that of the decidedly non-leftist John Mearsheimer: “[w]hat happened in Iran is an attempt by the Israeli & American tag team to overthrow the government in Tehran and break apart Iran, much the way the US, Turkey, and Israel fractured Syria…” It’s not as if this routine is a new one. Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the football. Over and over. Thank you AG. I have been reading NLR for decades, and have saved some valuable old issues, for example the issue-long essay on global economic turbulence Robert Brenner published in 1998. But these days with every new issue, I am finding fewer and fewer of the insights I am looking for in a “left” journal. I have been looking for an excuse to cancel my sub. I think I might have found it. I think Iran will turn out to be a test-case for the Left (or what’s left of it) in that intellectual honesty is clearly in conflict, once again, with political ideology. But this isn’t Stalin’s purges in the 1930s, or the Khmer Rouge, this is 2026 and the media, especially the regional media, is all over the place recording what’s going on. The standard argument that it isn’t happening because Iran is a state disliked by the United States and Israel and can therefore do no wrong, cannot function under such circumstances. The argument that it’s all due to sanctions is refuted by experts on the Iranian economy (including real Iranians) who point out that the role of sanctions has been greatly exaggerated: mismanagement of water supplies, for example, cannot be attributed to sanctions. And yes, bellicose statements by hard-line westerners provide the regime with a rationale for cracking down, as they do for all governments everywhere. But as always, the narcissistic self-licking ice-cream cone of the western comment industry cannot accept that the outside world has relatively little impact on the average disgruntled market trader in Tehran. For the Left, as for the Right, the level of likely ego-damage is too serious. As long as writers from the Notional Left begin by asking themselves “Am I being anti-American enough?” they will not be able to write anything useful. Ironically, the basic dynamics of the conflict (secular, democratic and leftist opposition linked to popular sentiment, against reactionary, repressive religious-dominated regime) should make it obvious which side the Left should be on. But as long as it adopts the approach that any enemy of the United States must be supported, it’s locked into a pattern of denial which will, in the end, do it a lot of damage, comparable perhaps to what happened to the Leftist groups that supported the repression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. It’ll be their fault. Ahem. Countries have a right to sovereignity. I don’t see how you attack the left for not being on board with regime changes operations. You want me to believe that 40,000 Starlinks walked in on little cat feet in all on their own? Or that a bunch of Iranians nicely asked Elon Musk? Do you think we are children? It’s been reported that the US raided the currency and arm-twisted Iran’s allies not to intervene to try to support it. That produced the plunge that set off the protests by businessmen (and the government said those protestors had valid complaints) which then ramped up by foreign-paid agitators who, just like the Maidan coup, instigated violence. Video is coming out that supports that version of events. Oh, and the right-wingers I know say the right wing social media supports the “son of Maidan” reading and many/most are not on board with the US wasting money and energy on regime change, so your take on political views, at least as far as the US is concerned, is blinkered. “(A) secular, democratic and leftist opposition linked to popular sentiment, against reactionary, repressive religious-dominated regime) should make it obvious which side the Left should be on.” Ah, were it so simple, but the opposition both within Iran, and most certainly in the diaspora, is much more complex than this, incorporating a very large, if not dominant, constituency of right-wing Neoliberal proponents of, not only regime change, but of crushing the historic socialist legacy of Iran’s revolution(s). Superficially, it is tempting to grant you your point, but consider that the Shaw-in-exile and his (and his dear dad’s) supporters await in the wings, and that the “Left” in Iran is perhaps also weighing its prospects against the Theocratic pot vs. the Neoliberal fire. I am far from convinced that the Iranian Left is behind these “protests”. Without even bringing in forces external to Iran, one should keep in mind that the “average disgruntled market trader in Tehran”, in other words a merchant or operator of the Tehran bazaar, is, and always was, about as “democratic and leftist” as a member of a traditional chamber of commerce in the Western world. OK? Is really there (around the World) a notional left asking themselves how much anti-American one has to be to be “true left” or something? If it exists their numbers must be very small. I tend to believe that any notional left might be allergic to interventionism which is a product of geostrategic interests and has no interest at all in the populaces at large. The protests in this occasion were aligned, almost certainly fed by and coincidental in time with foreign interests on regime change as a desired outcome. It is impossible to ignore how Trump was rising to the occasion to say he was going to bombard Iran in defence of the protestors. Obviously not because Trump’s humanitarian worries. Not possible to ignore the delivery of Starlink terminals to proceed and coordinate with the protests and aggressions. This is not to say there isn’t genuine and abundant discontent in Iran. Almost certainly. Abundant discontent is possibly the default in most if not all countries. At the end of the day we have more than 3000 thousand victims which no leftists should be happy about, but with serious doubts that things might have gotten that far without foreign intervention. If there is this secular struggle that you mention at the root and cause of protests, quite possibly it was the attempt by Israel and US to use it to their advantage what provided Iran government with a rationale to be more aggressive and expedite with the protests. OK, this is not to say that a social struggle cannot turn a bloodbath without external meddling. It can indeed. But here i suspect the gasoline and the spark were originated abroad. Thank you, Ignacio, for this pertinent and pungent riposte. If there were a global temperature scale for disgust and fury, I feel sure that it would be hitting record highs. Sigh …. for those not around long ago or even on NC the term left is a libertarian/Corp funded slur word. Socialists/Commies stealing stuff from hard working Capitalists aka vestiges of colonialism and the failed attempt in financial slavery by globalism. In the original classical meaning it denotes share of productivity and via that family formation e.g. the kids are the future. The best part is the left has never been in control in the West, FDR was not a commie lol. Not being a leftist I have no opinions on who the Left (to whatever extent it exists and is worth discussing) should or shouldn’t support there. I agree that Iran’s government seems like an unlikely target for them to side with, but then so do the supporters of Pahlevi. I suspect that leftists weighing in on Iran are going to come off badly whichever side they take. Either they support “reactionary theocrats massacring their own people” or they support “American imperialists and their puppets”. Or else they are fence-sitting and “hiding behind false nuance”. Iran is, somewhat more fundamentally, a problem for them because it challenges what appears to me to be common leftist assumptions: the supreme evil of non-leftist-controlled states, the inherent goodness (and leftwards tendency) of popular resistance, secularism over theocracy, etc. There are, in fact, good reasons to doubt the universal applicability of all of those premises in general and in this specific case (not to excuse Iran’s government, but if somehow it was overthrown by its enemies now I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect the result to be an even worse humanitarian catastrophe). But those reasons align poorly with the traditional leftist framework, which may be why this case causes such evident division and confusion among them – and why some non-leftists find it easier to navigate. Didn’t many leftists think kinda the same thing when the Shah was overthrown back un 1979 (or wrt Egypt during Arab Spring. Maybe they’d have thought the same about Ataturk if they were around in 1920.) The idea that a right wing authoritarian government shoukd be replaced not by “liberal leftist” regime but by another flavor of right wing authoritarian regime really does offend their dichotomous view about how the world works. Of course, people point out many original neocons started out as Tritskyite leftists who believed in inevitable triumph of the “left” in the struggle against (presumably monolithic) “authoritarian right” even when they were themselves yet another flavor of the authoritarian right themselves… Well said. I consider myself a “leftist”, but I’m an *authentic* one (ha ha, yes that is sarcasm). Unlike the straw man described by Aurelien, I don’t support the current Iranian government because I’m “anti-American” or because they are our enemies. Like any “real” leftist (again, irony quotes here), I dislike theocratic rule of any kind. Indeed, the reforms supported by the NLR author would be desirable in my view. But I hate US policy with a passion because it is NOT in any way about “democracy” or “rule of law” or “freedom” or any of those nice words. Rather, it is about economic exploitation and geopolitical advantage for US interests (or in this case those of Israel as well, which are identical in the neocon view). Its policies kill people and destroy nations whose governments resist our efforts. Anyone or anything that enhances those efforts should be condemned, even if they are the words of a well-meaning “leftist” academic. I could write a long essay off the top of my head for Aurelien on how we have done this in the past, and on the many ways in which the US has interfered significantly to destabilize such nations, prey on their weaknesses, and leverage their internal divisions until they crack. But I fear it would be wasted breath; I’d just be considered an egotistical American who insists on ignoring the “agency” of these target countries. I actually knew many Iranians during and after the revolution. All but one were Westernized “leftists” who hated Pahlavi but were certainly no fan of Khomeini. They had cautious hopes at first; these hopes were crushed as the Islamic Republic consolidated its control. No, I’m not a particular fan of the current government. But the balkanized chaos that will likely result from the US/Israeli will be worse. And though it is true that not *all* of Iran’s current problems are due to external pressures, certainly many of them are, or are exacerbated by them to a great degree. I’ll bet I could even find some “real Iranians” who would agree. A recent interview by the only left paper in Germany left (how many lefts can one include into an English sentence?) with a leftist from Iran sums up the problem in the headline already: “We want to confront the dictatorship and US imperialism.” Causes, composition, and perspectives of the protest movement in Iran. A conversation with Navid Shomali” https://archive.is/VE6GH I was sitting over a response to your post from last week (re: UKR/RU) but found nothing I drafted adequate. And yet here we are again. Same problem. The nation-state in the age of superpower imperial conflict appears to become a Catch-22 for the left. However the idea of international, i.e. cross-border solidarity – is not off the table – relevant just as it was in the late 1800s. British filmmaker Ken Loach in his (1995) “LAND AND FREEDOM” about the Spanish Civil War offered some wise scrutiny of this problem from the POV of the Anarchists who found themselves boxed in by the Fascists and the Stalinists. Same issue now. (Kurds is more complex but it is tangent to these normative contradictions.) re: “1956” (etc.) as mentioned by Aurelien above: Co-founder of German NACHDENKSEITEN alternative news site and former bureau chief of Willy Brandt, Albrecht Müller, spoke about the day USSR invaded Czechoslovakia: The then head of his office, an old-style German SPD man said “Ok, that´s tragic but we will carry on with “Ostpolitik” and not boycott the Russians.” That was a much more left SPD than anything that would follow. p.s. I don´t know much about Prague/1968. However Budapest/1956 has become more complicated for me with growing age because more and more hints are showing up that there was some inteference by the CIA too – not just the British. The real repression having been established in the Hungarian CP purges of 1948. And as far as I know the West did not really use 1948 as any means to upset the consolidation of CP power in Hungary. So there is logic to the anecdote that Churchill congratulated Stalin for suppressing the Socialists in Greece in 1948. “We want to confront the dictatorship and US imperialism.” A sympathetic idea in theory, but an additional problem is: what would that amount to in practice? Weakening the Iranian government naturally serves US interests. Confronting US imperialism from within Iran is ridiculous – all one can really do there is fight the rest of the opposition… which of course serves the interests of “the dictatorship”. It’s like how Makhno’s followers boasted of beating Whites until they’re red and Reds until they’re white. Sounds very brave and independent of them. In reality, despite occasionally skirmishing with the Reds, they mostly just repeatedly volunteered to be cannon fodder for the Reds and were then duly disposed of. If they hadn’t agreed to that, though, their actions still would’ve helped one side or the other more. They had no path to victory short of everyone else just collapsing or deciding to leave them alone. What makes this problem worse, from the movement cohesion standpoint, is that this dilemma – of really having to choose a side if you want to influence the outcome – is very obvious. And that collides with modern opposition movements’ typical moral and political absolutism (not just characateristic of the left, by the by). There can be no compromises with the absolute evil of the dictatorship or that of American imperialism. So if you’re clearly working to assist one and not the other, you are yourself compromised. In such conditions it also becomes tempting to pretend that it’s not evil after all. A lot of what’s left of Russian leftists and other activists are in this position too. Frankly, I think the whole concept of a lesser evil gets a bad rap in some politically earnest circles. There shouldn’t be any shame in admitting that sometimes you do have to choose a bad option and try to make the best of it – mitigate damage, keep looking for better possibilities, lay groundwork for later improvements. But this is denounced as a form of moral cowardice – by people who don’t actually have any better ideas, other than being virtuously ineffectual or else choosing a side but lying desperately about it to themselves and others. If I am hard on the left, part of the reason is that it seems inherently particularly inclined to this kind of self-defeating maximalism – anyone who tries to break away from that faces an uphill fight. (As for Prague, I’ll just add that the real work was done there around 1948 too. It’s also rather vexing that so many leftists broke with the USSR over that largely bloodless intervention against some liberal communists in a “civilised European country”. Bloodier events in less-civilised Hungary and far worse things still that happened in “semi-Asiatic” Russia did not bother them, apparently – but here they drew the line… I’d respect them more if they had not.) On that note: Maybe we should stop complaining in the West – or as anti-colonialist activist Nathalie Yamb said, as she has been sanctioned by the EU and the US for criticizing France in Africe – for Africans nothing of what is happening now is new. It is the Europeans and the rich and eduacted in the US who are shocked. But on a global scale both spatially and temporal their experience horizon is tiny compared to what other “civilisations” had to endure – from the hands of those who are now bathing in “victimhood”. And the Left in awe may well be in that category of “don´t take yourself too seriously”. They have to learn to fight again – not on Berkeley campus but in the “jungle”. re: Australia vs. free speech/Gaza CONSORTIUMNEWS has 4 pieces about Australia´s new legislation on censoring speech: Going Down, Down Under The Australian Parliament has passed a new hate crimes law that could potentially throw critics of Israel in prison for years by Joe Lauria https://consortiumnews.com/2026/01/22/going-down-down-under/ Oppose Israel’s Abuses While You Can The Israel lobby can cry about Jewish Australians feeling threatened by every pro-Palestine group and then ASIO will ban the group and cage anyone associating with it for up to 15 years. by Caitlin Johnstone https://consortiumnews.com/2026/01/22/caity-johnstone-oppose-israels-abuses-while-you-can/ Hate Crime Laws Can Chill Free Speech What is the impact that the Albanese government’s Combatting Antisemitism, Hate and Extremism Act 2026 will have on the ability of ordinary Australians to protest?

All this despite their extreme resource limitations and conditions, effects of the more than six decades of the morally despicable and abhorrent “sanctions” and blockade. AND let’s not ignore the recent, even more morally despicable, and abhorrent “on the verge” gloating… France intercepts sanctioned Russian oil tanker flying false flag in Mediterranean Indian Express “It was carried out in strict compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,” Macron said. BS by Macron. There is nothing in the UN Convention on the Law of Sea on supposed “international sanctions” that can be applied to any ships and then enforced on the high seas with supposed “false flags” because someone wants to suppose this. First, the sanctions which the EU unilaterally applies are not internationally recognized, except by EU members, and do not affect maritime traffic in the high seas but commerce and exchanges with the EU. Beyond that France or the EU have no competence or regulation of traffic in the high seas. This is violation of UNCLOS by France with apparent cooperation from the UK. Interception could have been lawful only and exclusively in territorial waters of France. Increasingly idiotic escalations. Wanting pretexts for war with Russia? One day they are going to find it and not to like it. Why the WHO respirator revolt could reshape global health governance Business Upturn If the WHO now concedes, as the letter urges, that airborne transmission is central and that respirators are materially superior, then every state that continues to permit surgical masks as default clinical protection exposes itself to claims that it is breaching its duty of care to healthcare workers and patients alike. I have always found this “debate” to be one of the more depressing aspects of both the covid pandemic and human society in the 21st century in general. There is a deadly virus loose among the population, and despite that, sober regulatory and administrative bodies insist on sticking with ineffective measures when effective ones are well known and readily available. Consequently, lots of people are ill and dying for no reason at all. BTW another aspect of this I haven’t seen discussed is that by requiring N95 masks to be used routinely, we will keep manufacturing lines for these masks open, and encourage continuous research on better masks. Consequently, we will be much less likely to be caught flat-footed when the next pandemic comes along as we were in 2020, when N95 masks were very hard to come by for a year or two. I keep hoping human beings are going to get with it. I’m still hoping. “sober regulatory and administrative bodies insist on sticking with ineffective measures when effective ones are well known and readily available. Consequently, lots of people are ill and dying for no reason at all.” I keep hoping, too. But nothing on this scale happens for no reason. Trump Says He Bruised His Hand on a Table (NY Times) I’m more worried about his brain. Pictures of the bruise spread on social media and elsewhere on Friday morning, in keeping with previous intense interest in the president’s health. Mr. Trump said that the bruise was also a side effect of taking aspirin. “I would say take aspirin if you like your heart. But don’t take aspirin if you don’t want to have a little bruising. I take the big aspirin. And when you take the big aspirin, they tell you you’ll bruise,” he said. Also, because the FDA won’t save you, you can try to save yourself “A Godsend”: ProPublica’s Rx Inspector Tool Is Helping People Find Critical Safety Information on Generic Drugs (Pro Publica) When was the last time T had his blood platelet count checked? Sorry if this comes across as off but if a Canadian PM or a US Commerce Secr. announce the end of anything that to me means definitely it is not the end. It´s if anything a repackaging of a brand. Trump is not looking or sounding good, the letter to Norway and his speech at Davos lead me to believe that SOTU may provide us with Trump’s “Biden Moment” when it becomes inarguable that there is something seriously wrong with him cognitively. The impact of that happening both domestically and overseas would be immense and immensely destabilizing. It might not be a bad idea to lay in some smelling salts, along with the popcorn. Trump, in ripping off the fig leaf, has been the best thing to happen to the inmates of the Empire in a very long time — may he not be lost to us before his time. Witkoff and Kushner Spend Almost Four Hours with Putin, but No Diplomatic Breakthrough Larry Johnson Johnson recalls this interesting bit of Cuban missile crisis history: The most prominent and well-documented example occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, a 13-day standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. … On October 26, 1962, Feklisov initiated contact with John Scali, an ABC News correspondent with ties to US officials. Acting on instructions from Moscow, Feklisov proposed a deal: The Soviet Union would remove its missiles from Cuba if the US pledged not to invade the island and removed its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. My recollection is that the RFK administration, composed of “the best and the brightest” the US had to offer, adamantly refused this proposal from the Soviets, presumably for the sin of advocating parity between the US and the Soviet Union, ie, dismantling forward-based missiles targeting the opposite country. Evidently, according to Kennedy, it was fine for the US to install such destabilizing missile batteries, but completely outrageous for the Soviets to do the same. Fun times. My recollection is that they accepted the deal. I concur, the Turkish missiles were removed, but the USA did not mention for many years for appearance sake. https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/cuban-missile-crisis “No one was sure how Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev would respond to the naval blockade and US demands. But the leaders of both superpowers recognized the devastating possibility of a nuclear war and publicly agreed to a deal in which the Soviets would dismantle the weapon sites in exchange for a pledge from the United States not to invade Cuba. In a separate deal, which remained secret for more than twenty-five years, the United States also agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey. Although the Soviets removed their missiles from Cuba, they escalated the building of their military arsenal; the missile crisis was over, the arms race was not.” I would add a theory of mine if I may: The US by that time had already established the new standard for future nuclear deterrence, POLARIS class SSBNs which would rewrite the rule of nuclear deterrence. So my critical 2 cents would be – knowing what would come anyway – trumping any RU old-fashioned ground-based missile threats with US seaborne missiles – the US Administration 1) did not give up any advantage with those Jupiters because SSBNs would replace those 2) the JUPITERS were out of date anyway and if I am correct they were scheduled to be replaced one way or another. This corresponds with the huge military build-up under JFK. Something conveniently omitted from history today while it is acknowledged with the legacy of such “warmongers” as Truman and Reagan the other two with huge defense budget increases. Argent Provocateurs have got the grey mare over the hump, can’t believe spot is $101 an ounce… Nearly 3.5x the spot price when doofus came back for a second round~ Nothing on the Hunt Brothers bubble though, they got it up to 6x the spot price in 9 months, whew! Yes indeed. Plus the Hunt Brothers were dealing on “margin,” ie. leveraged positions. Today, the “rules” are a bit more stringent as to margins. There are a lot of reasons why today is not a replay of 1980. For instance, see the Shanghai Exchange trading that poor nag at over $110 per this morning. There they tend to be “cash and carry” on their commodities bourse. There will be a shake-out if history is any guide, but the underlying fundamentals have changed from 1980. It’s a Brave New World out there. Stay safe, keep leverage to a minimum. Historically, China was all about silver and not much in gold. The push on silver is quite something, but still around 50-1 ratio, and the last time the silver/gold biblical ratio of 16-1 happened was at the height of the Hunt Brothers bubble in 1980. We Asked 300 People About Health Care Costs. The Numbers Are Shocking. (NY Times oped) Not to NC readers. When Congress allowed the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire at the end of December, my monthly health insurance bill went up by about $200 a month. That’s a good chunk of the $25,000 I expect to earn, after business expenses, in 2026. I am not alone in paying more for health care. More than 300 Times Opinion readers responded to a January invitation to share their experience of rising health care costs. They included a cancer patient who shifted care mid-recovery to a new insurance plan that doesn’t cover all her doctors. A mother who began skipping birthday parties to avoid the cost of a gift. A small-business owner who closed his doors. Many readers shared accounts of relying on retirement funds to pay for insurance. More than one Republican voter said they now regretted voting for that party. I am sharing a selection of these stories below, which have been edited for length and clarity. Recently, 17 Republicans joined with House Democrats to vote to reinstate the subsidies. The issue now rests with the Senate, though President Trump says he might veto any legislation to extend them. Senators should keep in mind these stories, which show just how untenable health care costs have become, fueling distrust, fear and anger across incomes and political persuasions. Lawmakers should restore the subsidies, which will provide much-needed relief to some 20 million Americans. It is the least they can do. “It is the least they can do.” The “least they can do” for whom? One either serves the People or Mammon. From what I have seen, Mammon is a fiercely jealous and hungry Ba’al. With the People at least, you have a chance. I don”t really know as I’m not a genius or anything but aren’t the subsidies to the insurance companies not people? When the subs went away the subsidy gets laid on the “consumer” so an honest description would be subsidies to corporations went away so average joe/sephine will have to cover it, o and ,gov has included a reasonable 10% increase per year because capitalism or some bs. Eat good, don’t get run over… Taibbi’s latest, public excerpt: Forget Trump and Greenland. Howard Lutnick Gave the Davos Speech that Mattered The death of globalization is the real headline from the international self-indulgence festival at Davos https://www.racket.news/p/forget-trump-and-greenland-howard 2 para’s from the longer article: “Globalization has been terrible for the United States. In addition to lost jobs and hollowed manufacturing towns, integration with countries like China has massively weakened worker bargaining power and put heavy downward pressure on civil liberties and democracy. Core Trump accusations that American voters have been asked to swallow shitty trade deals for decades and foot Europe’s security bills for even longer (while getting little in return) aren’t wrong. That globalization caused once-powerful countries to lose self-sufficiency — a security issue as well as an economic one — and prioritize global economic growth over the needs of their own citizens is no longer even denied, not that anyone wants to hear it. Watch what happened when Lutnick articulated the traitorous idea that countries should take care of their own citizens first, saying this is the “job” of government. “I would suggest that policy is something for other countries to deeply consider,” he said, “to take care of their own, and then we will work out wonderful relationships between us.” There was a hush and then the moderator asked, “Can I bring you back to Greenland?” an aside: my fear is that Lutnick’s idea of countries ‘taking care of their own citizens’ has more to do with digital-IDs, CBDCs, and panopticon surveillance than with improvement in Main Street economics. Hear, hear.. Lutnick may say globalization has failed the West and United States of America. I’m not too sure about that, but American elite greed and stupidity has sure won the day. And cracking down on your own citizens will only put America that much farther behind. But I fear greed and stupidity will win out here too. Thanks for the link. Nice rhetoric from Lutnick, though I think Taibbi is being a touch naive here: I remember Bubba Clinton saying much the same, thirty years ago. We’ll see how it goes. AI hasn’t delivered the profits it was hyped for, says Deloitte The Register Seriously? “We’re working with this big large manufacturing company,” Sarrafi explained. “They have about 7,000 suppliers. And every single time they needed to restock something, they had to coordinate with so many suppliers. It’s actually the most boring job ever for everyone. But then they deploy this agent worker or a team of agent workers that basically monitors the stock levels. As soon as it goes below the forecast requirements level, it sends a preliminary email to the supplier saying, ‘Can you tell us if you can supply this and what price?'” The result is a summary report sent to Microsoft Teams that a company planner has to review and approve. Honestly, doesn’t this sound like a short python script that a summer intern could crank out in a week or two (or an hour or two) and would not cost $20 billion dollars or suck down every watt in the Texas power grid? If this is the kind of brain-dead value proposition this AI dude is relying on for sales, he will be one of the first to go. I had a VBA macro that did this in coordination with outside vendors, 15 years ago. RE: Trillion Dollar Question What does this guy not understand about information, supply/demand, and classical economic theory? First there is no such thing as perfect information so buying a long term asset (house) is a crap shoot. Insurance rates are going up because of catastrophic losses from floods and fires (mostly). But there are other elements that are needed for a home to be ‘valuable’, and that is utilities (water and sewer specifically). If your local sewage treatment plant gets swallowed by the sea your 5bed 3bath home becomes practically unlivable. If home values decline so does tax revenue to repair or relocate these utilities. In my town expensive, vulnerable to disaster homes retain value because the scenic and cultural qualities of the populace are attractive to very wealthy newcomers who can readily rebuild after a catastrophic fire or other loss (including going standalone PV, and high-tech water/sewer treatment). There appears to be endless money chasing these homes. But, in the end, it is the quality of the community (and jobs) that encourages folks to ignore the climate change risks. Re: Learn to Love Engineers Once again we get an article which tries to draw a comparison between Chinese and American society: Wang’s response unfolds through what may be the most illuminating comparative framework for understanding contemporary China and the United States: the “engineering state” versus the “lawyerly society.” I have to say as an American I really don’t get “lawyerly society”. As an older American that can compare what America was like fifty years ago to today I would make the argument that we were maybe more a lawyerly society in the past, but much less of that today. I would have to say that the overriding vibe I get from our ruling elites today is we are a corrupt society. We have laws, but those with vast amounts of money or power routinely ignore them. Maybe that’s where the lawyers come in to the picture. Just saying… Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: Discount Brokerage Market Report 2026- Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031

Time Published: 2026-01-23T11:08:00Z
Full Content:
January 23, 2026 06:08 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Discount Brokerage Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Discount Brokerage Market is projected to expand from USD 26.14 billion in 2025 to USD 37.16 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 6.04%. These financial intermediaries specialize in executing security orders at reduced commission rates, catering primarily to investors who function independently of personalized advisory services. The market's expansion is fundamentally propelled by the democratization of financial access, where technological breakthroughs and the widespread availability of mobile devices have drastically reduced entry barriers for retail participants. Additionally, this upward trend is bolstered by increasing levels of financial literacy and a growing preference for cost-efficient, self-directed investment platforms. According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the global trading volume of listed securities rose by 9.6% in the first half of 2024, indicating strong and continued investor participation in equity markets. Despite this positive growth trajectory, the market faces substantial hurdles related to strict regulatory compliance and the need for operational resilience. Global regulatory authorities are implementing more rigorous standards concerning digital engagement strategies and risk management to safeguard inexperienced investors against market volatility. This intensifying regulatory environment requires significant capital allocation toward compliance infrastructure and restricts the use of certain aggressive customer acquisition tactics. Consequently, these pressures can compress profit margins and hinder the pace at which firms can establish operations in new jurisdictions. Market Drivers A significant increase in retail investor participation and adoption among millennials serves as a primary driver for the discount brokerage industry, causing a fundamental shift in client demographics. This momentum is defined by a new generation entering the market, empowered by accessible educational materials and a cultural trend favoring early financial independence. The arrival of younger demographics has compelled brokerages to adjust their service models to support smaller account balances and higher trading frequencies, departing from traditional wealth management frameworks. The scale of this retail capital accumulation is evident in recent financial reports; according to Robinhood Markets, Inc., assets under custody rose by 76% year-over-year to reach $152.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, underscoring the massive influx of capital from this growing segment. The development of mobile-first and user-centric trading platforms acts as the essential technological foundation facilitating this demographic transition. Brokerage firms are focusing on intuitive interface designs and seamless mobile app functionality to satisfy clients who require immediate market access and execution capabilities. By prioritizing digital experience and minimizing friction in the trading process, these platforms encourage higher engagement and trade volumes among self-directed investors. The magnitude of this activity is reflected in key operational metrics; for instance, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. reported a 46% increase in Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) to 2.823 million in October 2024 compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the extensive reach of these digital access points is illustrated by The Charles Schwab Corporation, which reported record total client assets of $9.92 trillion during the third quarter of 2024, highlighting the vast scale of the modern self-directed investment landscape. Market Challenges Stringent requirements for regulatory compliance and operational resilience imposed by global authorities currently serve as a major constraint on the Global Discount Brokerage Market. As regulators enforce strict standards regarding digital engagement and risk management, brokerage firms are forced to direct significant capital toward establishing advanced compliance infrastructures rather than investing in product innovation or geographical growth. This reallocation of resources results in higher operational costs, which directly undermine the low-commission business model essential to discount brokerages. Additionally, prohibitions on aggressive acquisition strategies, such as gamified user interfaces, restrict the ability of firms to rapidly attract the next generation of retail investors, effectively slowing the market's organic growth rate. The severity of this regulatory landscape is highlighted by the increasing frequency of punitive actions taken against non-compliant entities. According to the North American Securities Administrators Association, state securities regulators executed 1,183 enforcement actions and secured over $69 million in fines in 2024 to address regulatory infractions. These enforcement measures emphasize the intensified scrutiny directed at the sector, establishing substantial barriers to entry for new competitors and compelling existing players to prioritize regulatory compliance over market share expansion, thereby impeding the overall development of the brokerage landscape. Market Trends The incorporation of AI-driven predictive analytics and hybrid robo-advisory services is transforming discount brokerages into comprehensive wealth management centers. Firms are increasingly integrating automated planning tools and predictive insights directly into trading interfaces to provide retail investors with access to sophisticated portfolio strategies. This shift toward a technology-driven advisory model meets the growing demand for personalized guidance that extends beyond simple execution, thereby fostering deeper user engagement. The extent of this adoption is substantial; according to Fidelity Investments' Q3 2024 update, the firm logged 7.1 million Customer Planning Interactions year-to-date, representing an 11% year-over-year increase, which validates the sector's effective pivot toward digitally enabled advisory solutions. Concurrently, the inclusion of direct cryptocurrency and digital asset access is redefining the asset composition within the market. To compete with specialized exchanges and appeal to younger demographics, traditional brokers are rapidly embedding spot crypto trading into their primary ecosystems. This convergence enables investors to manage both equity and digital asset portfolios within a single, unified environment, which enhances platform retention and diversifies revenue streams. The financial impact of this expansion is evident; according to Robinhood Markets, Inc., cryptocurrency revenue jumped 165% year-over-year to $61 million in the third quarter of 2024, underscoring the vital role digital assets play in driving growth for modern brokerages.

Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me. I was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires. I also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech. It felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone. Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

Given these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group. That's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances. In job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us. Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking.

In early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted. However, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates. My goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial. I eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version. I could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more. Fortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role. Within a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer. That was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day. By March, I had received and accepted an offer for the software engineering role. I started at Snap in August 2023 and am now a machine learning engineer. One thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on. My top pieces of advice for other job seekers are: I'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road. Additionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.

Title: How Designers and Artists Build AI-Proof Income with Shopify Shops

This post contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission if you click on them and make a purchase. It’s at no extra cost to you and helps us run this site. Thanks for your support! Generative models create images faster than you can sketch. Algorithms generate logos in seconds. However, AI cannot ship a screen-printed poster to a doorstep. This physical reality checks the current creative industry. You need a strategy to survive the generative flood. We call this building AI-proof income with Shopify. It is your exit ramp from the commodity race. Pixels are cheap now. Atoms remain expensive and valuable. Therefore, you must pivot. Your survival depends on moving from selling services to selling goods. We define this shift as the Tactile Moat. This concept suggests that physical objects possess an inherent defense against digital automation. You create value where AI cannot reach. AI-proof income with Shopify becomes the foundation of this defense. Do you want to compete with a robot that never sleeps? Or would you rather sell something that it cannot touch? The choice seems obvious. Consequently, we must explore how commerce saves the artist. Digital files suffer from an abundance. Midjourney creates infinite JPEGs. Conversely, physical objects rely on scarcity. AI cannot weave a rug or mold a ceramic vase. This physical limitation is your greatest asset. We call this the Digital Devaluation Thesis. As the cost of digital content approaches zero, the value of physical artifacts increases proportionally. AI-proof income with Shopify relies on this thesis. You secure value by moving from pixels to atoms. A client might generate a logo for free. However, they cannot generate a limited edition vinyl toy. They must buy it. Thus, you control the supply chain. You own the distribution. You become a manufacturer of culture rather than a service provider for it. We are witnessing a new economic behavior. We term this the Artifact Protocol. Consumers now crave authentic, tangible proof of human effort. They buy the story attached to the object. A print on a wall proves taste. A digital file merely occupies hard drive space. Therefore, selling physical goods satisfies a deep psychological need. This need protects your revenue. You need a robust engine to power this transition. Shopify provides the necessary infrastructure. It handles payments, inventory, and global taxes. You focus on the craft. AI-proof income with Shopify requires technical reliability. The platform offers specific tools that favor the visual entrepreneur. First, the visual editor allows for total brand control. You do not need to code complex HTML. You drag and drop elements to match your aesthetic. Second, Shopify integrates with social commerce. You sell directly through Instagram or Pinterest. This feature shortens the distance between inspiration and purchase. Furthermore, the analytics dashboard reveals who buys your art. You own the customer data. Marketplaces like Etsy often hide this from you. Ownership of data creates long-term security. Your shop is not just a catalogue. It is a digital gallery. Shopify themes support high-resolution imagery and video. You can tell the story behind the product. Why did you choose this paper? How did you mix that ink? These details matter. They justify the price. Consequently, the platform acts as a stage for your Tactile Moat. Inventory costs money. Warehousing takes space. Dropshipping solves this liquidity problem. A third party prints and ships your design. You never touch the box. This model lowers the barrier to entry. It allows you to test ideas rapidly. You upload a design. If it sells, it gets printed. If it fails, you lose nothing. However, you must be careful. Generic dropshipping kills brands. You must curate rigorously. We suggest a strategy called Hybrid Fulfillment Architecture. You use dropshipping for low-margin items like t-shirts or mugs. Simultaneously, you keep high-value items in your own studio. This mix balances risk and authenticity. It creates a scalable path to AI-proof income with Shopify. Perhaps you want full control. Self-shipping builds stronger connections. You hold the stock. You pack the boxes. This allows for the Unboxing Equity. You add handwritten notes, use custom tissue paper, and include stickers. These small touches prove a human was involved. AI cannot replicate care. Therefore, shipping becomes part of the art. Do not stop at t-shirts. The market is flooded with apparel. AI-proof income with Shopify demands innovation. Think about functional art. Each of these items requires manufacturing. Each has weight and texture. They exist in the real world. Thus, they retain value. We predict the emergence of the Human Premium. This is an extra cost consumers will willingly pay for non-AI goods. As generative content floods the web, human-made work becomes a luxury status symbol. Your Shopify store verifies this status. You are not just selling a product. You are selling the guarantee of human origin. AI-proof income with Shopify capitalizes on this shift. The future belongs to the builders, not the prompters. By establishing your store now, you secure your position. You build a direct line to your audience. No algorithm stands between you and your income. What is the “Tactile Moat”?The Tactile Moat is a strategic framework. It suggests that physical products offer economic protection against AI automation. AI creates digital files, not physical objects. Therefore, selling physical goods secures your value. Can I really build AI-proof income with Shopify?Yes. By selling physical goods, you bypass the competition of generative AI. You sell items that require manufacturing and logistics. These barriers protect your business from digital saturation. Do I need to hold inventory to use Shopify?No. You can use dropshipping apps. These services print and ship products on demand. However, holding some inventory allows for better quality control and custom packaging. What is the “Human Premium”?This is a predicted economic shift. Consumers will pay more for goods certified as human-made. It is a reaction to the overabundance of AI-generated content. Is Shopify better than a marketplace like Etsy?Shopify gives you full control. You own your customer list. You control the branding. Marketplaces can change their algorithms and hide your products. Shopify builds an independent asset. Feel free to browse WE AND THE COLOR’s Design, Art, and Technology sections to stay up to date. Subscribe to our newsletter!

Δ These cuts will be part of the second round of a broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs, and they will follow the first round that involved 14,000 layoffs in October, Reuters reported Thursday (Jan. 22), citing unnamed sources. The latest round is likely to impact four Amazon business units: Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology, which is the firm’s human resources division, according to the report. The full scope of the layoffs is not known, and the plans could change, per the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Reuters report, the 30,000 jobs that Amazon plans to cut under this plan would amount to only a small portion of the company’s 1.58 million employees but 10% of its corporate workforce. It would also follow Amazon’s elimination of 27,000 jobs in 2022. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue It was reported in October, just before the first round of the latest wave of layoffs, that Amazon planned to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs as part of an effort to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and the number of managers at the company. About a year earlier, in September 2024, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online. When the company began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said Amazon had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Thousands of corporate jobs on chopping block as giant seeks to trim workforce by 30,000 — All we know

American tech and e-commerce giant Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week, as part of its plan to trim its workforce by 30,000, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two sources familiar with the matter. These layoffs — among the company's largest — are likely to impact white-collar roles across divisions, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video and retail, it added. Sources added that the plans could change. In October last year, Amazon culled 14,000 white-collar jobs (around half of its target of 30,000), and is expected to do the same this year, as per the sources. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment, the report added. According to a Bloomberg report, as of September 2025, Amazon had around 1.57 million employees — a majority of whom worked in its warehouses. Its corporate workforce comprised around 3,50,000 people, it added. The Reuters report added that 30,000 cuts would be 10% of the company's corporate workforce. Notably, this would be Amazon's largest layoff in 30 years, after it cut 27,000 roles in 2022. Those laid off in October were given 90 days on payroll to either seek jobs externally or find other roles internally. This period expires on 26 January 2026 (Monday), it added. The Reuters report added that the Seattle-based online retailer's job cuts in October were tied to increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) software. It cited an internal memo which stated: “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” However, later during the company's Q3 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts that the cuts were not AI-driven or financially driven, but rather due to “culture”. He added, “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers”. In 2025, Jassy said he expected the company's corporate workforce to reduce as AI efficiencies increase. The Reuters report added that to save costs, corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks. Amazon's AWS itself touted its latest AI models during its annual cloud computing conference in December.

The company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target first reported by Reuters. The total this time is expected to be roughly the same as last year and could begin as soon as Tuesday, the people said, who asked not to be identified because they were ​not authorized to discuss Amazon’s plans.

The people cautioned that ⁠the details of Amazon’s plans could change.

Corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. Amazon touted its ⁠latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December.

The majority ⁠of Amazon’s workers are in fulfillment centers and warehouses. It would be the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The company trimmed about 27,000 jobs in 2022. Affected workers in October were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply ⁠for jobs internally or seek other employment. That period expires on Monday.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is planning to eliminate thousands of corporate employees, with cuts expected to begin as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions would mark the company's second wave of mass layoffs since October, when Amazon cut about 14,000 jobs. Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000. The latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture. Amazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters earlier reported this latest round of cuts could come as early as next week. Have a tip?

Title: Bitcoin options show pro traders expect more downside, but also plan to accumulate
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-options-show-pro-traders-expect-more-downside-but-also-plan-to-accumulate
Time Published: 2026-01-23T01:04:19Z

Bitcoin derivatives markets show traders holding steady, but the path back to $95,000 relies on institutional inflows returning, especially after this week’s $1.58 billion outflow. Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Bitcoin funding rates sit at 7%, showing bullish traders are still hesitant to increase leveraged positions. The spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.58 billion in outflows while gold hit record highs, signaling a shift toward safe assets. Bitcoin (BTC) has been pinned below $91,000 since Tuesday, even as equity markets rallied on strong US economic growth and employment data. As BTC struggles to find bullish momentum, muted demand for leveraged long BTC positions has led traders to question whether the $88,000 support level can hold much longer. The annualized funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual futures stood at 7% on Thursday, with the typical neutral range being 6% to 12%. While this marks a recovery from Monday, when the indicator nearly hit zero, significant demand for bullish leverage is still missing from the market. The lack of optimism among Bitcoin traders stems partly from the robust 4.4% third-quarter US GDP growth. A strong economy generally fuels earnings momentum, providing a tailwind for the stock market. Continuing jobless claims fell by 26,000 to 1.85 million for the week ending Jan. 10. Despite this tepid conviction, there has been no notable surge in demand for downside protection via BTC options. According to data from Laevitas, the two most active BTC options strategies on Wednesday and Thursday were the long straddle and the long Iron Condor. Both strategies prioritize volatility over directional bets. This suggests that whales and market makers are anticipating a period of price accumulation rather than a deeper correction from the current $89,500 level. To determine if professional traders are holding firm following an 11% weekly correction from the Jan. 14 peak of $97,900, one must analyze exchange long-to-short ratios. This metric offers a broader view than a single contract by aggregating positions across futures, perpetuals, and margin markets. Top traders at Binance increased bullish exposure on Thursday, with the long-to-short ratio rising to 2.18 from 2.08. Similarly, the top 20% of users by margin on OKX boosted long positions on Thursday despite Bitcoin's failure to reclaim $90,000. This onchain data reinforces the view that traders remain neutral-to-bullish despite the current lack of appetite for high-leverage plays. Market attention is now shifting toward corporate earnings. Several major companies report next week, including Microsoft (MSFT US) and Tesla (TSLA US) on Wednesday, followed by Apple (AAPL US) and Visa (V US) on Thursday. Consumer demand will also be scrutinized as General Motors (GM US) and Starbucks (SBUX US) release their reports on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices hit an all-time high on Thursday as 10-year US Treasury yields approached 20-week highs. This divergence typically signals waning confidence in US fiscal health, and investors are clearly worried that further economic stimulus may trigger inflation, given the expanding US deficit. Related: Bitcoin's 16.7K inflow to exchanges raises alarm: Will BTC’s sell-off deepen? Rising Treasury yields indicate lower buyer demand and higher borrowing costs for the government. The 10-year yield reached 4.25% on Thursday, up from 4.14% the previous week. Ultimately, Bitcoin derivatives are showing resilience after the $88,000 retest, with few signs of bearish sentiment. However, a move back toward $95,000 depends heavily on institutional inflows. This trend has yet to materialize following $1.58 billion in net outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs over the past two days.

PHOTO: AFP PublishedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 07:15 AM UpdatedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 12:44 PM SAN FRANCISCO - Amazon is planning a second round of job cuts next week as part of its broader goal of trimming some 30,000 corporate workers, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target first reported by Reuters. The total this time is expected to be roughly the same as 2025 and could begin as soon as Jan 27, the people said. company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Jobs in the companyâs Amazon Web Services (AWS), retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was unclear. The people cautioned that the details of Amazonâs plans could change. The e-commerce giant tied the October round of job cuts to the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that âthis generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the internet, and itâs enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever beforeâ. However, chief executive Andy Jassy later told analysts during the companyâs third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was ânot really financially driven and itâs not even really AI-drivenâ. Rather, he said, âitâs cultureâ, meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. âYou end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,â he said. Mr Jassy had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazonâs corporate workforce to shrink over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. Amazon touted its latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion of Amazonâs 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10 per cent of the firmâs corporate workforce. The majority of Amazonâs workers are in fulfillment centres and warehouses. It would be the largest layoff in Amazonâs three-decade history. The company trimmed about 27,000 jobs in 2022. Affected workers in October were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply for jobs internally or seek other employment. That period expires on Jan 26.

Damien, this has been a journey, man. Like, this is the 18th year of producing The Changelog. As you know, when Wynn Netherland and I started this show back in 2009, I corrected myself recently. I thought it was November 19th. It was actually November 9th was the very first, the birthday of The Changelog. November 9th, 2009. And back then you ran Pusher, Pusher.app. And that’s kind of when sponsoring a podcast was kind of like almost charity. Like, you didn’t get a ton of value because there wasn’t a huge audience, but you wanted to support the makers of the podcast. And, you know, we were learning, and obviously open source is moving fast and we were trying to keep up, and GitHub was one year old. I mean, like, this is a different world. But I want to start off by saying, you were our first sponsor of this podcast. I appreciate that, man. Welcome to the show. Damien Tanner So kind of you. I, you know, reflecting on Pusher, we kind of just ended up creating a lot of great community, especially around London and also around the world with Pusher. And I really love everything we did. And we started an event series. And in fact, another kind of like coming back around, Alex MacCaw, who works at Mastra, he’s coming to speak at the AI Engineer London meetup branch that I run. And he started and ran the Pusher Sessions, which became a really well known talk series in London. Adam Stacoviak Okay. Were you at the most recent AI conference? I was in SF. Damien Tanner Yeah. Adam Stacoviak What was that like? I can always kind of jump in the shark a little bit because I kind of want to talk. I want to juxtapose like Pusher then timeframe developer to like now, which is drastically different. So don’t, let’s not go too far there, but how was AI in SF recently? Damien Tanner It was a good experience, always a good injection of energy going to SF. I live just outside London. But, you know what, the venue was quite big and it didn’t have that like, together feel as much as some competitors. But it was the first time though I sat and, you know, huge conference hall. And I think it was like Windsurf or something’s chatting and I was like, this is, this is really like, we’re all miners at a conference about mining automation. And we’re like, we’re engineers. So we’re super excited about it, but, right, it’s kind of weird. Like, it’s going to change all of our jobs. All right. It’s like, I’m working right now to change everything I’m doing tomorrow, right? I mean, that’s kind of how I viewed it. Adam Stacoviak I was watching a lot of the playback. I wasn’t there personally, this time around, but I would want to make it the next time around. But, you know, just the Swyx, the content coming out of there, everybody’s speaking, I know a lot of great people are there. Obviously pushing the boundaries of what’s next for us, the frontier, so to speak. But a lot of the content, I mean, almost all the content was like, top, top notch. And I feel like I was just watching the tip of humanity, right? Like just experiencing what’s to come because in tech, you know this as being a veteran in tech, we shape, we’re shaping the future of humanity. In a lot of cases, technology drives that. Technology is a major driver of everything. And here we are at the precipice of the next, the next, next thing. And it’s just wild to see what people are doing with it, how it’s changing everything we know. Everything. I feel like it’s like a flip. It’s a complete, not even a one eighty, like a 720, you know what I mean? Like it’s three spins or four spins, it’s not just one spin around to change things. I feel like it’s a dramatic forever. Don’t even know how it’s going to change things, changing things thing. Damien Tanner [04:05] I mean, you know, bringing it back to the Pusher days, it’s the vibe we had then. You know, there was this period around just before Pusher and the first half of Pusher, I felt like where we were going through this. Maybe it’s called like the Web 2.0, but there was a lot of great software being built. And a lot of, you know, the community. And I think the craft that went into, especially like the Rails community. And we were just able to build incredible web-based software. And then, you know, we’ve gone through like the commercialization, industrialization of SaaS. And what gets me really excited is now when we’re, you know, we run this AI Engineer London branch. And incredible communities come together. And it’s got that energy again. And I guess the energy is very exciting. There’s new stuff. Everyone can play a part in it. And we’re also just all completely working it out. And it’s like, you’ve got the, you know, folks on the main stage of the conference. And then you’ve got, we’ll chat about it later, maybe like, Geoffrey Huntley, posting his meme, blog post. It’s like that the crazy ideas and innovation is kind of coming from anywhere, which is brilliant. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, there’s some satire happened too. I think there was a talk that was quite comedic. I can’t remember who the talk was from, but I was really just enjoying just the fun nature of what’s happening and having fun with it, not just being completely serious all the time with it. For those who are uninitiated, and I kind of am to some degree, because this has been a long time, remind me and our listeners what exactly was Pusher. And I suppose the tail end of that, how are things different today than they were then? Damien Tanner Pusher was basically a WebSockets push API. So you could push anything to your web app in real time. So just things like notifications into your application. We ended up having a bunch of customers, maybe in finance or crypto or any kind of area where you need to live updating pricing. In the early days at one point, Uber was using Pusher to update the cars in real time before they built their own infrastructure. And it was funny. I remember the standout because we ran a consultancy where we were chatting about the WebSockets in browsers and we’re like, oh, this is cool. How can we use this? And the problem is, you know, we were all building Rails apps. So like, okay, we need like a separate thing, which manages all the WebSocket connections to the client. And then we can just post an API request and say, push this message to all the clients. It was a simple idea and we took it seriously and built it into pretty formidable dev tool used by millions of developers. And still used a lot today. And we eventually exited the company to MessageBird who are kind of European Twilio competitor. Actually, at one point, we nearly sold the company to Twilio. That would have been a very different timeline. Adam Stacoviak According to my notes, you raised $9.2 million, which is a lot of money back then. I mean, it’s a lot of money now, but like, that was tremendous. That was probably 2010, right? 2011? Damien Tanner The bulk of that we raised later on from Balderton. Okay. The first round was maybe half a million. Very, very small. And it started out the agency. So we built the first version in the agency. Just for fun, I suppose. Adam Stacoviak And maybe some tears on your part. Juxtapose the timeline, right? You got an acquisition ultimately, but you mentioned Twilio as an opportunity. How would have that been different, if you can like branch the timeline? Damien Tanner [08:09] It would have been a great experience to work with the team. There’s incredible people who watched Twilio and move through Twilio. I don’t know. I haven’t calculated it, but we didn’t sell, because the offer wasn’t good enough in our minds. It was a bit of a local, and it was stock. In hindsight, the stock hasn’t gone very well. Turns out it was a good financial decision, but would have loved that experience. I think Twilio became the kind of OG of DevRel, right? And dev community. And we’ve run, you know, how we got to know them is we did a lot of combined events with them and hackathons with them. That was a fun time. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, they were like the origination. Jeff Lawson was, you know, very much quintessential in that process of a whole new way to market to developers. And I think that might have been the beginning of what we call DevRel today. Would you agree with that? I mean, it’s like, if there was a seed, that was one of many, probably, but I think one of the earliest seeds to plant of what DevRel is today. Damien Tanner Crazy times, man. Adam Stacoviak So how do you think about those times of Pusher and the web and building APIs and building SaaS services, et cetera, and, you know, pushing messages to Rails apps. How are today’s days different for you? Damien Tanner It’s exciting, because the web and software is just completely changing again. Like, I feel like we had that with Web 2.0, right? That was the birth of software on the internet, hosted software on the internet. And it’s such an embedded thing in our culture, in our business, as developers, a lot of us work on that kind of software. But most businesses run on SaaS software now. And I have to remind myself, like, there was a time before SaaS. And therefore, there can be a time after SaaS, and there can be a thing that comes after SaaS. And it’s not a given that SaaS sticks around. I mean, like any technology, we tend to kind of go in layers, right? We still have a bunch of copper phone lines around the place, and we use them for other things, and we’re slowly replacing them. Like, these changes, you know, in the aggregate take a lot of time. But I guess, you know, the thing that can shift more quickly is the direction things are going. And really in the last few months, I think I’ve been more and more convinced by my own experiences and things I’ve seen playing with stuff, that it’s entirely possible, and probably pretty likely that there is a post SaaS. And I think I don’t know if everyone realizes, but like the, or everyone is with that intention, but like all of us playing with agents and LLMs, whether it’s to build the software or to do things, we are doing that. You know, when we’re probably doing that instead of building a SaaS, we’re using it to build a SaaS, right? It’s already playing out amongst the developers. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, it’s an interesting thought experiment to think about the time before SaaS and the potential, as you may say, the potential time after SaaS. I’m curious because I hold that opinion to some degree. I think there’s, you know, what SaaS stays and what SaaS goes if it dies. And you said in the pre-call, burst the bubble a little bit here, you did say, and I quote, all SaaS is dead. Can you explain your homework? All SaaS is dead. Damien Tanner I think I should probably go through my journey to here, to kind of illustrate it, because… Adam Stacoviak Give us the TLDR first, though. Give us the, the clip, and then go into the journey. Damien Tanner Okay, okay. The TLDR is SaaS. So there’s a few layers as like the building of software or parts to software. There’s a building of software. And then there’s the operating of software to get something done. And I think most developers are very familiar with like the building of software as changing now. But the operating software, the operating of work, the doing of work in all industries and all knowledge work, can change like we’ve changed software. And SaaS is made for humans, slow humans to use. The SaaS UI is made for a puny human to go in, you know, understand, you know, work at this complex thing and it has to be in a nice UI. If it’s not a human actually doing the work that they do in the SaaS, if it’s an AI doing that work, why is there a, why is there a SaaS tool? The AI doesn’t need a SaaS tool to get the work done. It might need a little UI for you to tell you what it’s done. But the whole idea of humans using software, I think, is going to change. It can. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Well, you’ve been steeped in, and I still want to hear your journey, but I’m going to step in one second. You’ve been steeped in APIs and SaaS for a while. So I hold that opinion that you have that I agree that the, if the SaaS exists for a UI for humans, that’s definitely changing. So I agree with that. Where I’m not sure of, and I’m still questioning myself is like, what is the true solution here? There are SaaS services that can simply be an API. You know this, you built them. I don’t really need the web UI. Actually, I kind of just prefer the CLI, I kind of prefer just JSON from my agents. I kind of prefer Markdown for me because I’m the human. I want those good prose. I want all of it local. So my agents can, you know, mine it and create sentiment analysis and, you know, all this fun stuff you could do with DuckDB and Parquet and just super, super fast stuff across embeddings and, you know, vector, you know, PG vector, all those fun things you could do in your own data. But that’s where I stop is I do agree that the web UI will go where some version of it. Maybe it’s just there’s like a dashboard for those who don’t want to play in the dev world with CLIs and APIs and MCP and whatnot. But I feel like SaaS shifts. Like my take is CLI is the new app. That’s my take is that SaaS will shift. But I think it will shift into CLI for a human to instruct an agent and an agent to do. And it’s largely based on API, JSON, you know, clear defined endpoints, great specifications, things that get more and more mature as a result of that. Damien Tanner Yeah, I guess we should probably kind of tease apart SaaS the business and SaaS the software. Okay. Because yeah, I agree that the interface is changing. The interface that we use, whether it’s visually CLI or a chat conversation or something. But the way we communicate with the software is changing, right? It’s a much more natural language thing. We don’t have to dig in the UI to find the thing to click. But also so much of the software we use that we call SaaS that we access remotely. If you can just magic that SaaS locally or within your company, right? There’s no need to access that SaaS anymore, right? You just have that functionality. You just ask for that functionality and it’s being built. But yeah, SaaS, the business, I guess this is the challenge for companies today is they’re going to have to, if they want to stay in business, they’re going to have to shift somehow. Because yeah, I mean, there’s still got to be some harness, harness is the wrong word because you use that in coding agents, but like some infrastructure, some cloud, some coordination, authentication, data storage, there’s still a lot to do. And I think there’s going to be some great opportunities for companies to do that. And maybe a CRM, a Salesforce or something, manages to say, hey, we are, people like Salesforce trying to do that. We are the place to run your sales agents, right? You’re magically instantiated CRM code that you want just for your business. Maybe there’ll be some winners there. But the idea that I think the thing that’s going to change SaaS’s business, SaaS Software is the idea that like everyone has to go and buy the same version, you know, of some software which they remotely accessing can’t really change. Adam Stacoviak Okay, I’m feeling that for sure. Take us back into the journey then because I feel like I cut you off and I don’t want to disappoint you, but not let you go and give the context, the key word for most people these days, the context for that blanket statement that SaaS is dead or dying. Damien Tanner Yeah, okay, I’ll give you a bit of the story. So my company Layercode, I’ll just give you a little short on that. We provide a voice agents platform. So anyone can add voice to their agent. It’s developer tool, developer API platform for that. And we’re now ramping up our sales and marketing. And we kind of started doing it the normal ways. We kind of got a CRM. We got some marketing tools. And I was just finding, we went through a CRM too. And I was just finding them like, these are like the new CRMs that are supposed to be good. They were just really, really slow. And then I just couldn’t work out how to do stuff. It was like, I had to go and set up a workflow. And it was like, I needed training to use this CRM tool. And I’d been having a lot of fun with Claude Code and Codex, kind of both flipping between them, kind of getting a feel for them. And so I just said, build me a, I just voice dictated, you know, a brain dump for like 10, 15 minutes. Here’s the CRM I need. And also it wasn’t just like a boring CRM, it was like, I need a CRM, I need you to make a CRM that kind of engages me as a developer who doesn’t wake up and go, let’s do sales, you know, gamify it for me. And then here are the ways I want you to do that. And it just did it. That was my kind of like coding agents moment. And I think you have that moment when you do a new project. You use an LLM and a completely greenfield project. And there’s no kind of existing code it’s going to kind of mess up or get wrong and the project’s not too big. It just built the whole freaking CRM. And it was really good. It was a good CRM and it worked really well. And so that was like my kind of like level one awakening, which was like this idea that you can just have the SaaS you want instantly. It suddenly felt true. It felt, because I had done it. And I have canceled the old CRM system now. And there’s a bunch of other tools I plan to cancel. You know, because they’re all crap, but because it’s harder to use them than it is to just say what I want. Because I kind of have to learn how to use those tools. Whereas I can just say, make me the thing, make me the website I want instead of using a website builder tool or make me the CRM that I want to use. And then there’s this like different cycle that you have, the loop that you have of improvement, where it’s not a once, it’s not build and then use the software. It’s like as you’re using the software, you can improve the software at any time. And we’ve still got to work out how this works. Like who has the power to change the software? And how do you share that amongst a team, right? And do I have a branch of the software that I, or do I have different, like my own views or something in the CRM that I can mess around with? But just as a within our team of three doing this stuff in the company, it was like, oh, you’re annoyed with this part of the software. Just change it. Just change it. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. When it annoys you, it’s the exact point of time and then continue with the work. Right. And I assume you’re probably still doing like a GitHub or some sort of like primary GitHub, not literally like GitHub, but git repository as a hub for your work, right? And you probably have pull requests or merge requests. So even if your teammate is frustrated, improves the software, pushes it back, you’re still using the same software and you’re still using the same traditional developer tooling, which is pull requests, code review, merging. Damien Tanner Yeah. That’s going to have to change as well. Adam Stacoviak Okay. Take me there. I woke up this morning with that feeling. Damien Tanner Okay. That’s changing too. Adam Stacoviak How’s it changing? Damien Tanner With the CRM and with something we’ve been building this week, there were new pieces of software. There weren’t existing code bases. I didn’t have any prior ideas and taste and requirements about what the code should look like. I think this is the thing that slows people down with coding agents. You use it on existing repo and LLMs have bad taste. They just give you kind of the most common denominator, kind of bad taste version of anything, whether it’s like writing a blog post or coding, right? And so when you use it on an existing project and then you review the code, you just find all these things wrong with it, right? It’s like, you know, right now they love doing all this like really defensive try-catch in JavaScript or really verbose stuff or right now a utility function that exists in a library already. But when you start on a new project and you just use YOLO mode and you’re just, you know, you’re building something for yourself as well, right? And it works. Like, where’s the code? Why review the code? I think we’re only in this temporary, weird thing where we’re like trying to jam, like we have these existing software processes that ensure we deliver high quality software, secure software, good software. I think it’s hard, we can’t throw it, we’ve got SOC 2, we can’t throw those out the window for everything that exists today. But for everything new that you’re building, you’ve got an opportunity to kind of pull apart, question and collapse down all of these kind of processes we built for ourselves, processes that were built to ensure humans don’t make mistakes, right? And help humans collaborate and help humans manage change in the repository and everything. It’s like if the humans aren’t writing the code anymore, we need to question these things. Adam Stacoviak Are you moving into the land of agent first then? It sounds like that’s what you’re going. Damien Tanner I feel like I’m being pulled into it by, yeah, I’m slight, I’m kind of like, there is a tide. I can’t resist. I’m falling in the hole. And we’re kind of like, we’re dipping our toes in, right? Trying to try out Cursor and Tab. And then we’re kind of in there and we’re swimming, trying to swim the way we normally swim the way we want to go. And suddenly I’ve just gone, just like relax and just let the tide, let the river take you. Just let it go, man. Just let it go. Adam Stacoviak It’s scary. Damien Tanner It feels kind of terrifying and there are going to, and I don’t have the answers to how we do code review. But you know, if you look at like a lot of, you know, teams talking about using AI coding agents and the resisting project, everyone’s big problem now is code reviews, right? Because everyone using coding agents is producing so many PRs, it’s like it’s piling up in this review process that has to be done. The new teams that don’t have that process in place, they are going multiple times faster right now. Adam Stacoviak Okay. What is replacing code review if there’s no code review? Is it just nothing? Damien Tanner To these teams that you’re explaining about, like us as developers, we need to think more like, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of PMs, designers, managers. Because they don’t, they don’t look at the code, right? They say we need this functionality. We build it. We do our code reviews. We ensure it works. And the PM, whoever, goes, oh yeah, great. I’ve used it and it’s a requirement. It’s great, right? They’re comfortable not looking at the code. They’re a long way from the code. They’re closing the deal. They’re with the customer. They’re integrating. They’re like, I am confident that the intelligent being that created this code did a good job. Now, I think the only reason we’re kind of stuck in this old process is because many of them are set in stone. But also because LLMs aren’t quite smart enough yet. They still make stupid mistakes. Right. You still need a human in the loop and on the loop. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, I mean, they’re still a bit dumb and they get done with silly things and they do. Oh, look, they’re going the wrong direction for a while. And I’m like, no, hang on a second. That’s a great thought here. But let’s get back on track. This is the problem we’re solving. And you’ve sidequested us. It’s a fun sidequest, that was the point, but that’s not the point. Damien Tanner But this is going to change. Right. And this is one of the hard things is trying to put ourselves in the mindset of what it’s going to be like in a year. And I think I’ve only been, you know, after us being able to play with LLMs for several years, it feels like I can feel the velocity of it now. Right. Because I’ve felt GPT-3, 4, 5, Claude, Codex. And now I can go, oh, okay, that’s what it feels like for it to get better. And it’s going to keep getting better for a few more years. So it’s kind of like self-driving cars, right? They’re like not very useful while they’re worse than humans. But suddenly when they’re safer than a human, like, why would you have a human? Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner And I think it’s the same with coding. Like all this process is to stop humans making mistakes. We make mistakes. Like our mistakes are not special, better mistakes. They’re still like, we stuff up code. We cause security incidents. And so I think as soon as the LLMs are twice as good, five times as good, 10 times better at outputting good code that doesn’t cause these issues. We’re going to start to let go of this concern, like these things, right? We’re going to start to trust them more. Adam Stacoviak Something I leaned on recently, and it was really with Opus 4.5. I feel like that’s when things sort of changed because I’m with you on the trend from GPT-3 on to now and feeling the incremental change. I feel like Opus 4.5 really changed things. And I think I heard it in an AI talk or at least in the intention of it, if it wasn’t verbatim, was trust the model. Just trust the model. As a matter of fact, I think it was one of the guys, man, they were building an agent. And in the process was maybe as an agent layer, layer agent, something like that. Maybe borrowed something from your name, Layercode. I have to look it up. I’ll get the talk. I’ll put in the show notes. But I think it was that talk. And I was like, okay, the next time I play, I’m going to trust the model. And I will sometimes like stop it from doing something because I think I’m trying to direct it in a certain direction. And now I’ve been like, wait a second. And like, this code’s free basically. It’s just going to generate anyways. Let’s see what it does. Worst case, I’m like, you know, roll back or worst case is like just generate better. I mean, like ultra think. Right. You know, what’s the worst that could happen because it’s going faster than I can. Anyways, let’s see. Even if it’s a mistake, let’s see the mistake. Let’s learn from the mistake because that’s how we learn even as humans. I’m sure LLMs the same. And so I’ve come back to this philosophy or this thought, almost to the way you describe it, like falling into this hole, slipping in via gravity. Not excited at first, but then kind of like excited because like, well, it’s good in there. Let’s just go. Just trust the model, man. Just Damien Tanner [30:03] Trust the model. And it can surprise you. And I think that still gives me that dopamine hit that I would have coding, right? When I was coding manually, you’d get a function right and you’d be like, “Ah, it works.” And now it’s like, you’ve got the whole application and you’re like, “Ah, I just did a problem for the whole thing works.” That’s right. Yeah, it’s really exciting. And yeah, it’s fun right now. I mean, it’s going to keep changing. This is just a bit of a temporary phase here and now. But I think for many of us building software, we love the craft of it, which you can still do. But also the making a thing is also one of the exciting bits of it. And the world is full of software still. Like, you think about so many interactions you have with like government service or whatever. Not saying that they’re going to adopt coding agents, particularly, but there is a lot of bad software in the web. And software has been expensive to build. And that’s because it’s been in high demand. And so I don’t think we’re going to run out of stuff to build. I think even if we get 10 times faster, 100 times faster, there’s so much useful software and products and things and jobs to be done. Adam Stacoviak Close this loop for me then. You said SaaS is dead or dying. I’m paraphrasing because you didn’t say “or dying.” I’m just going to say we’re dying. I’ll parenthesis. That’s my parenthesis. I’ll add it to your thing. How is it going to change then? So if we’re making software, there’s still tons of software to write, but SaaS is dead. What exactly are we making then? If it’s not SaaS. I know that not all software is SaaS, but you do build something, a platform, and people buy the platform. Is that SaaS? What changes? You mentioned interfaces like, where do you say that? Damien Tanner I think we’re moving. And so this is the next level. The next kind of revelation I had was I started using the CRM. I was like, this is cool. This is super fast. This is better than the other CRM. And I can change it. Cool. I’m doing some important sales work. I’m enriching leads. And then I kind of woke up a few days later. I was like, why am I doing the work? What’s going on here? I create an interface for me to use, right? Why can’t Claude Code just do the work that I need to do for me? I know it’s not going to be with the same taste that I have. And I know it’s going to make mistakes. But I can have 10 of them do it at the same time. And it’s not a particularly fun idea, fully automated sales. And what that means for the world in general, but it’s the particular vertical where I had this kind of revelation, right? Well, the enriching certainly makes sense for the LLM to do, right? The enriching is like, come on, that’s under the API, I’m copying things. And a lot of it is so manual still. And so the revelation was just waking up and then going, okay, Claude Code’s going to do the work for me today. Like it does for software. It builds the software for me. I’m going to give it a Chrome browser connection. That’s still a non-solved problem. There’s a lot of pain in LLM chatting to the browser. But there’s a few good ones. And I’m going to let it use my LinkedIn. I’m going to let it use my X. And I’m going to connect it to the APIs that I need that aren’t pieces of software, but like data sources, right? I can get enriched and search things. And then I just started getting it to just do it. And it was really quite, it was slow. But it was really quite good. And that was a kind of, that was like that moment where we typed in, build this feature in Claude Code, build this. But it was suddenly like this thing can just do anything a human can do on a computer. The only thing holding it back right now is the access to tools and good integrations with the interfaces, like the old software it still needs to use to do what a human does. And a bigger context window and it’d be great if it was faster. But I can run them in parallel so that the speed’s not a massive problem. And in the space of a week, I built the CRM. And then I got Claude Code to just do the work, but I didn’t tell it to use the CRM. I just told it to use the database. And I just ended up throwing away the CRM. And now we have this little Claude Code harness that overrides the Claude Code system prompt, sets up all the tools and gives it a Postgres database. And I’ve just got like, I need to vibe code a new CRM UI. But I’ve just got like a database viewer that the non-technical team used to kind of look at the leads and stuff like that. It’s just a kind of Beekeeper kind of database viewer. And now Claude Code is just doing the work. We’ve only applied it there, but this is just like Claude Code is like this kind of little innovation in an agent that can do work for a long time. And we already know people use ChatGPT for all sorts of different things beyond coding, right? And so suddenly I think these coding agents are a glimpse of all knowledge work can be sped up or replaced. Administration can be replaced with these things now. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, these non-technical folks, why not just invite them to the terminal and give them CLI outputs that they can easily run and just up arrow to repeat or just teach them certain things that maybe they weren’t really comfortable with doing before. And now they’re also one step from being a developer or a builder because they’re already in the terminal. And that’s where Claude’s at. Damien Tanner Yeah, I mean, that’s what we’ve done now. I’ve seen some unexpected kind of teething issues with that. I think there’s just a terminal feels a bit scary to non-technical people. Even if you explain how to use it, like when they quit Claude Code or something, they’re just kind of like lost. They’re like, “Oh my gosh, where did Claude Code go?” Adam Stacoviak Yeah. And I was onboarding whatever team, it was like open the terminal. And then I’m like, okay, we’ve got a CD. What if the terminal was just Claude Code? What if you built your own terminal that was just— Damien Tanner I think when I actually think about specific UI, whether it’s terminal or web UI, it’s kind of not the handle there, but there is the magic is a thing that can access everything on your computer, right. And they’re doing that with, I think it’s called Co-Work. Have you seen Co-Work yet? Adam Stacoviak So it’s like, I haven’t played with it enough to know what it can and can’t do. I think I unleashed it on a directory with some PDFs that I had collected that was around business structure. And it was like an idea I had like four months ago with just a different business structure that would just make more sense primarily around tax purposes, you know. And I was like, hey, revisit this idea I haven’t touched it in forever. And it was a directory. And I think it went and it just did a bunch of stuff. But then it was like, come on with ideas. I’m like, nah, there’s not good ideas. I don’t know like if it’s like less smart than Claude Code is in intent or whatever, but it’s kind of, I think that’s what you’re trying to do with Co-Work. But you know, you could just drop them into essentially a directory, which is what Claude Code lives. And it lives in a directory of maybe files that is an application or knows how to talk to the database as you said your CRM does. And they can just be in the Claude Code instance, just asking questions. Show me the latest leads. Damien Tanner Yeah. That could use a skill if you want to go that route or it can just be smart enough to be like, well, I have a Neon database here. The Neon CTL CLI is installed. I’m just going to query it directly. You have to be able to write some Python to make it faster. Maybe I’ll store some of this stuff locally and it’ll do it all behind the scenes. But then it gives this non-technical person a list of leads. All I had to do was be like, give me the leads, man. You know. And then you mentioned enabling them as builders. I think it then is a window into that because then when they want something, oh, they get curious, right? They’ll be like us. They’re just going to be like, hey, build me a report for this. Build me a web app for this. Help me make this easier. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. You’d be surprised how easy that is, like, help me make it easier is one of those weird ones. And Claude Code will also auto complete and just let you tab and enter. And I’ve noticed that those things got more terse. Like, maybe I think if the last one I did was like, that’s interesting. It was like super short. It was like, “I like it, implement it.” What was the completion for them? Damien Tanner “I like it, implement it.” I was like, okay, is that how easy it’s gotten now to like just spit out a feature that we were just riffing on that you know the problem. You understand the bug we just got over. And now your response to me to tell you what to say because you need me the human to get you back in the loop. At least in today’s REPL is “I like it, implement it.” You know what I mean? Adam Stacoviak I found myself just responding with the letter Y. I know a lot of the time it just knows what to do, right? Even if it kind of like is a bit ambiguous, you’re kind of like you’ll work it out. Damien Tanner So I think it’s very exciting that Anthropic released this Co-Work thing because they’ve obviously seen that inside Anthropic. All sorts of people using Claude Code. And you know, when we think about, okay, someone starts there for non-coding purposes, but stuff is done with code and CLI tools and some MCPs or whatever, APIs. And then the user says, well, make me a UI to make this easier. So for instance, I had to review a bunch of draft messages that I wrote. I was like, okay, this is kind of janky in the terminal. Make me a UI to do the review. It just did it. And I think this is where software is changing because when the LLM is 10 times faster, I mean, if you use the Groq with a Qwen 10 points, right, they’re insanely fast. It’s going to be fast. Then if you can have any interface you want within a second, why have static interfaces, right? Adam Stacoviak Yeah, I’m camping out there with you. What if everything was just in time? I think that interface. What if I didn’t need to share it with you? Because you’re my teammate, but what if you could do the same thing for you and it solves your problem? And you’re in your own branch and what you do in your branch, it’s like Vegas and it stays there. It doesn’t have to be saved anywhere else, right? Like just leave it in Vegas, right? What if in your own branch, in your own little world, as a sales development representative, for example, an SDR who’s trying to help the team, help the organization grow and all they need is an interface. What if it was just in time for them only? And it didn’t matter if it was maintainable. It didn’t matter how good the code was. All it mattered was that it solved their problem, get the opportunity and enable them to do what they got to do either to do the job. And you just take that and multiply or copy and paste it on all the roles that make sense for that just in time. What? It completely changes the idea of what software. It also completely changes how we interact with the computer and what a computer does and what it is for. I just love this notion that every user can change the computer, can change the software as they’re using it as they like it. Damien Tanner I think that’s very essentially everyone’s a developer. Yeah, I mean, it’s the ultimate way to use a computer like all the gates are down, right? There’s no geeky prerequisite anymore. If I want software the way I want software so long as I have authentication and authorization, I got the keys to my kingdom I want to make. And I think also the agents can preempt, right? I haven’t tried this yet, but I was thinking of giving it the little sales thing. We have a little prompt where it says, like, either if a web UI is going to be better for the user to do this, review this, then just do it. So then instead of you asking it, you ask it to do some work and then it comes back and be like, oh, I’ve made you this UI where I’ve like displayed it all for you. Have a look at it. Let me know if you’re happy with it. I mean, this is getting kind of wild this idea, but you, it’s kind of how we can think about how we communicate with each other as humans, as employees, right? We have back and forth conversations. We have email, which is a bit more asynchronous. You know, we put up a preview URL or something. Like I think all those communication channels can be enabled in the agent you’re chatting to and like I haven’t like this kind of like product companies have sell, you know, the initial messaging where people solve like digital employees, right? But something like that’s going to happen. And I don’t think it’s the exciting bit for me is the human computer interaction, right. It’s like and this is how it’s kind of exciting in the context of Layercode and why we love voice is like voice is this OG communication method. Whereas humans we’ve been speaking, we started speaking before we were writing. And it’s kind of quite a rich communication medium. And it’s a terrific way, like if your agents can be really multi-medium, whether it’s you’re doing voice with them, text with them, they create a web UI for you, you interact with the UI with them. Like there doesn’t have to be these strict modes or delineations between those things. Adam Stacoviak Well, let’s go there. I didn’t take us there yet, but I do want to talk to you about what you’re doing with Layercode. I obviously produce a podcast. So I’m kind of interested in speech to text to some degree because transcripts, right. And then you have the obvious version, which is like you start out with speech, you get something or even a voice prompt. What exactly is Layercode? And I suppose we’ve been 51 minutes deep on nerding out on AI essentially. And not at all on your startup and what you’re doing, which was sort of the impetus of even getting back in touch. That’s all you had something new you were doing. And I’m like, well, I haven’t talked to Damien since he’s sponsored the show almost 17 years ago. It’s probably a good time to talk, right? So there you go. That’s how it works out. Has your excitement and your dopamine hits on the daily or even by minute by minute changed how you feel about your ability with Layercode. And what exactly are you trying to do with it? Damien Tanner [46:29] Well, there’s, and we’ve talked a lot about the building of a company and the building of software now. And I think founders today have that, it is as important as the thing that they’re building, right? Because if you just head into your company and operate it like you did a few years ago, using no AI, using all your kind of slow development practices, using our slow sales and marketing practices, you’re going to really get left behind. And so there is a lot to be done in working out and exploring what the company of the future looks like. What the software company of the future looks like. I’m very excited about the idea that we can build large companies with small teams. I think a lot of developers, well, I mean, there is a lot of HR and politics and culture change that happens when teams get truly large and companies get truly large. And this is one of the kind of founding principles when we started our startup was let’s see how big we can make this. Yeah. We’re the small team. And that’s very exciting because I think you can move fast and you can keep culture and keep a great culture. And so that’s why we invest a lot of our energy into the building of the company. And what we build and what we provide right now is, and our first product is a voice infrastructure, voice API for real-time building real-time voice AI agents. And this is currently a pretty hard problem. We focus a lot on the real-time conversational aspect. And there’s a lot of kind of weird problems in that, right? Conversations are dynamic things. And there’s a lot of state changes and interruptions and back channeling and everything that happens. And if you’re a developer building an agent, it could be your sales agent, it could be a developer of a coding agent. And you want to add voice AI, there’s a bunch of stuff you’re going to bump into when you start building that. And it’s a pretty, it’s interesting, we kind of see our customers, we can kind of predict where they are in that journey, right, because there’s a bunch of problems that you don’t kind of preempt and then you just quickly slam into them. And so we’ve solved a lot of those problems. And so with Layercode you can then just take our API, plug it into your existing agent backend, so you can use any backend you want. And you can use any agent LLM library you want and any LLM you want. So the basic example is a Next.js application that uses the Vercel AI SDK. We’ve got Python examples as well. And you connect up to the Layercode voice layer and put in our browser SDK and then you get a little voice agent microphone button and everything in the web app. We also connect to phone over to layer. And then for every turn of the conversation, whenever the user’s finished speaking, we ship your backend that transcript. You call the LLM of your choice, you do your tool calls, everything you need to do to generate a response like you normally do for a text agent. Then you start streaming the response tokens back to us. And then as soon as we get that first word, we start converting that text to speech and start streaming back to the user. And so there’s a bunch of stuff you have to do to make that really low latency, make that a real time conversation where you’re not waiting more than a second or two for the agent to respond. So we put a lot of work into refining that. And there’s also a lot of exciting innovation happening in the model space for voice models, whether it’s transcription or the text to speech. And so we give you the freedom to switch between those models, right, so you can try out some of the different voice models, some that are really really cheap and really you know got really casual voices and some like ElevenLabs, they’re a much more expensive but they’re very professional clean voices and you can find the right fit for your kind of experience that you want, trade off. There’s a lot of trade-offs, right, in voice between latency, price, quality, so we let users explore that and find the right fit for their voice agent. Adam Stacoviak That is interesting. So Next.js SDK, streaming, latency, is it, you’re meant to be the middleware between implementation and feedback to user. Damien Tanner Yeah, we handle everything related to the voice basically and we let you just handle text like a text chatbot basically. Adam Stacoviak No heavy MP3 or wave file coming down, just— Damien Tanner Yeah, and everything’s streaming. And so it’s a very interesting problem to solve because the whole system has to be in real time. So the whole thing, we call it a pipeline. I don’t know if that’s a great name for it because it’s not like an ETL loading pipeline, but the real time agent system, our backend, when you start a new session, it runs on Cloudflare Workers. So it’s running right near the user who clicked to chat with your agent with voice. And then from that point on everything is streaming. So the microphone input from the user’s browser streaming in, that is then getting streamed to the transcription model in real time. The transcription model is spitting out partial transcripts. We send that partial transcript back to you so you can show what you’re saying if you want to show them that. And then the hardest bit in this whole thing is working out when the user is finished speaking. It’s so difficult because we pause, we make sounds, we pause and then we start again and conversation is such a dynamic kind of, it’s like a game almost, right? Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner So we have to do some clever things, use some other AI models to help you detect when the user ends speaking. And when we have enough confidence, like there’s no certainty here, but we have enough confidence, I think the user finished their thought, then we finalize that transcript, you know, finish transcribing that last word and ship you that whole user utterance, like whether it’s a word, a sentence, paragraph the user has spoken. The reason we have to kind of like, we can’t stream at that point, right, we have to like bundle up this user utterance and choose an end, is because LLMs don’t take a streaming input. I mean, you can stream the input but like you need the complete thing, the complete question to send to the LLM to then make a request to the LLM to then generate any response, right? There is no duplex LLM that like takes input and generates output at the same time. Adam Stacoviak Technically, what if you constantly wrote to a file locally or wherever the system is and then at some point it just ends and you send a call that sends the end versus packaging it up and sending the whole thing once it’s done. Like you incrementally, yeah just line by line, it’s like maybe even like, I don’t know, I’m not sure how to describe but that’s how I think about like what if you constantly wrote to something and you just said okay it’s done and what was there was the done thing. Damien Tanner Yeah, so we can do that in terms of like, because we have to, partial transcripts, yeah, so we can, you can stream the partial transcripts and then say okay now it’s done, now make the LLM call, then you make the LLM call. But interesting, text, sending text is actually super fast in the context of, very fast. And actually the default example, this is crazy, I didn’t think this was, this would work until we tried it but it just uses a webhook. When the user finishes speaking, the basic example sends your Next.js API route a webhook with the user text. And turns out the webhook sending, sending webhook with a few sentences in it, that’s like, that’s fine, that’s fast. It’s all the other stuff, like then waiting for the LLM to respond. Adam Stacoviak Yeah, that’s actually not the hard part. I mean, you have to be a millisecond or somewhat a few milliseconds but it’s not going to be a dramatic shift the way I described it versus how you do it. Damien Tanner Yeah, and we’ve got a WebSocket endpoint now so we can kind of shave off that HTTP connection and everything but yeah, then the big heavy latency items come in. So generating an LLM response, most LLMs we use right now, they’re optimized, the ones we use in coding agents, they’re optimized for intelligence, not really speed. Then when people optimize for speed, the LLM labs, they tend to optimize for just token throughput. Very few people optimize for time to first token. And that’s all that matters in voice is I give you the user utterance, how long is the user going to have to wait before I can start playing back an agent response to them? And time to first token is that, right, how long before I get the first kind of word or two that I can turn into voice and they can start hearing. The only major LLM lab that actually optimizes for this or maintains a low latency of TTFT is Google and Gemini Flash. OpenAI, most voice agents now doing it this way, we’re using GPT-4o or Gemini Flash. GPT-4o has got some annoying, the OpenAI endpoints have some annoying inconsistencies in latency. And that’s kind of the killer in voice, right, it’s a bad user experience if it works you know the first few turns of the conversation are fast and then suddenly the next turn the agent takes three seconds to respond to you. Like is the agent wrong? Is the agent broken? But then once you get that first token back then you’re good because then you can, you send that text to us, you start streaming the text to us and then we can start turning into full sentences. And then again we get to this batching problem. The voice models that do text to voice, again they don’t stream in the input. They require a full sentence of input before they can start generating any output because again how you speak, how things are pronounced depends on what comes later. And so you have to then buffer the LLM output into sentences, ship the buffered sentence by sentence to the voice model, and then as soon as we get that first chunk of 20 millisecond audio, we chunk it up into, we stream that straight back down WebSockets from the Cloudflare worker straight into the user’s browser, we can start playing the agent response. Adam Stacoviak You chose TypeScript to do all this? Understand we’re pretty set on Cloudflare Workers from day one, okay. Damien Tanner And it just solves so many infrastructure problems that you’re going to run into later on. I don’t think we’ll need a DevOps person ever. Yeah, it’s such a, it’s interesting, it’s such a wonderful platform. There are constraints you have to build to, right, you’re using V8 JavaScript, browser JavaScript in a Cloudflare worker. Tons of Node APIs don’t work. There is a bit of a compatibility layer. You do have to do things a bit differently. But what do you get in return? Your application runs everywhere at 330 locations around the world. There is essentially zero cold start. Cloudflare workers start up in the time while the SSL negotiations are happening, the worker has already started. And you have very few limitations to your scaling, extremely high concurrency. Every instance is very kind of isolated, that’s really important voice as well. There’s often quite big spikes, like 9 a.m. everyone’s calling up somewhere that’s got a voice agent and asking to kind of book an appointment or something. You get these big spikes. You want to be able to scale and you need to scale very quickly because you don’t want people waiting around. And if you throw, well if you throw tons of users on the same system and you start kind of overloading it then suddenly people get this problem where the agent starts responding in three seconds instead of one second. And it sounds weird but yeah, Cloudflare gives you an incredible amount of that for no effort. And I think compared to kind of Lambda and stuff it’s also pretty, like the interface, it’s just a HTTP interface to your worker. There’s nothing in front and you can do WebSockets very nicely. And there’s this crazy thing called Durable Objects which I think is a bad name— Damien Tanner [60:08] And it’s also kind of a weird piece of technology, but it’s a little JavaScript runtime that is persistent basically and has a little SQLite database attached to it. And it is — I don’t know what the right word is, it’s kind of like, it’s not the right word for JavaScript, but it’s basically think of it like thread safe. So you can have it take a bunch of WebSocket connections and do a bunch of SQL writes to its SQLite database it has attached, and you don’t have to do any kind of special stuff dealing with concurrency and atomic operations. So you know, the simple example is just implement a rate limiter or a counter or something like that. You can do very simply in Durable Objects. You can have as many Durable Objects as you want. Each one of them has a SQLite database attached to it. You can have 10 gigabytes per one. And you can then kind of do whatever, you can kind of shard however you want, right? You could have a Durable Object per customer that tracks something that you need to be done real time. You could have a Durable Object per chat room. As long as you don’t kind of — like it does have a set amount of compute, a Durable Object, but you can use it for all sorts of magical things. And I think it’s a real underknown thing that Cloudflare has. Coming from Pusher, it’s like the kind of real-time primitive now. And a lot of the stuff we’d reach for something like Pusher, Durable Objects — especially when you’re building a fully real-time system — is really grateful. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. You chose TypeScript based on Cloudflare Workers, it sounds like, because that gave you three hundred locations across the world, Durable Objects, great ecosystem, no DevOps. For those who choose Go — or I don’t think you choose Rust for this because it’s just not the kind of place you put Rust — but Go would compete for the same kind of mind share for you. How would the system have been different if you chose Go, or can you even think about that? Damien Tanner [62:10] I haven’t actually written any Go, so I don’t know if I can give a good comparison. But from the perspective of what we do have out there — there are similar real-time voice agent platforms in Python. And I think because a lot of the people building the models, the voice models, then built coordination systems like Layercode for coordinating the real-time conversations, Python was the language they chose. And I think what’s more important is the patterns rather than the specific languages. And so we actually wrote the first implementation with RxJS, and that has an implementation in most popular languages. I hadn’t used it before, but we chose it because it was for stream processing. It’s not really for real-time systems, but it gives you subjects, channels — these kinds of, it has its own names for these things — but basically it’s like a pub-subby kind of thing. And then it’s got these kind of functional chaining things where you can then kind of pipe things and filter things and filter messages and split messages and things like that. And that did allow us to build the first version of this kind of quite dynamic system. We didn’t touch on it, but interruptions is this other really difficult dynamic part where whilst the agent is speaking its response to you, if the user starts speaking again, you then need to decide in real time whether the user is interrupting the agent or are they just going “yeah” and like agreeing with the agent, or are they trying to say “oh stop.” How much of the hard problems — we have to still be transcribing audio even when the user is hearing it, and we’ve got to deal with background noise and everything. And then when we’re confident the user is trying to interrupt the agent, we’ve then got to do this whole kind of state change where we tear down all of this in-flight LLM request, in-flight voice generation request, and then as quickly as possible start focusing on the user’s new question. And especially if their interruption is really short, like “stop” — suddenly you’ve got to tear down all the old stuff, transcribe the word “stop,” then ship that as a new LLM request to the backend, generate the response, and then get the agent speaking back as quickly as possible. And it’s all happening down one pipe, as it were, at the end of the day, right? It’s like audio from the browser microphone and then audio replaying back. And we would have bugs like you’d interrupt the agent, but then when it started replying there’d still be a few chunks of 20 millisecond audio from the old response snuck in there, or the old audio would be interleaved with the new audio from the agent back. And you’re kind of in Audacity or something, some audio editor, trying to work out like what’s going — why does it sound like this? And you’re rearranging bits of audio going, “Okay, the responses are taking turns every 20 milliseconds, it’s interleaving the two responses,” trying to work out what’s going on. Real pain in the bottom, yeah. Adam Stacoviak When you solve that problem with the interruption, do you focus on the false examples, the true examples? So do you like have these — if it is an interruption you can tell it’s an interruption by these 17 known cases? Like how do you direct that, the interrupt? Damien Tanner It really depends on the use case. How you configure the voice agent really depends on how the voice agent is being used, right? Like a therapy voice agent needs to behave very differently than a vet appointment booking answering phone agent. Adam Stacoviak [66:21] Yeah. What about dogs barking in the background? Damien Tanner Yeah, there’s that. And when we call that audio environments, that’s often an early issue users have. It’s interesting, they’re like, “Well, my users call from cafes and it kind of really misunderstands them.” And big problem with audio transcription — it just transcribes any audio it hears, right? So if someone’s talking behind you, the model doesn’t quite know that’s irrelevant conversation. It’s just transcribing it all. But if you imagine the therapy voice agent, it needs to actually not respond too quickly to the user and allow the user to have long pondering thoughts, long sentences, big pauses. Maybe tears, they’re crying, or just some sort of human — you know, interrupt, but it’s not a true interrupt. It’s something that you should maybe even capture and process. And so you can choose a few different levels of interruption, right? You can just interrupt when you hear any word. By default, we interrupt when we hear any word that’s not a filler word, so you filter out things like that. And then if you need some more intelligence, you can actually just ship off the partial transcripts to an LLM in real time. So let’s say the user’s speaking while and starts interrupting the agent — every kind of word you get, or a few words, you fire up a request to Gemini Flash and you say, “Here’s the previous thing that the user said, here’s what the agent said, here’s what the user just said. Respond yes or no, do you think they’re interrupting the agent?” And you get that back in about 250-300 milliseconds. And you just — as you get new transcripts you can cancel the old ones — you just constantly try and make that request until the user stops speaking. Then you get the response from that and then you can kind of make quite an intelligent decision. But these things feel very hacky, but they actually work very well. Adam Stacoviak [68:26] Well, the first thing I think about there is that Gemini Flash is not local. So you do have to deal with an outage or latency or downtime. Or in Cloudflare’s case, most recently, a lot of downtime because of usage — like really heavy usage. Unless it is — I’ve had more trepidation with Cloudflare than ever, and I’m like, “Okay cool, I get it.” You know, I’m not upset with you because I empathize with how in the world do you scale those services. Damien Tanner Yeah, it’s the Ralph effect. Adam Stacoviak It’s the Ralph effect. And I’m like — so why does your system not allow for a local LLM to be just as smart as Gemini Flash might be to answer that very simple question? Like an interrupt, it’s a pretty easy thing to determine. Damien Tanner Yeah, yeah. I think smaller LLMs can do that. Gemini is just incredibly fast, and I think because of their TPU infrastructure they’ve got an incredibly low TTFT — time to first token — which is the most important thing. But I agree that there are smaller LLMs, and actually I think probably maybe one of the Groq with a qLLaMA is actually might even be a bit faster. We should try that. But you make a point about reliability. People really notice it in voice agents when it doesn’t work, for sure. And especially for businesses relying on it to collect a bunch of calls for them. And so that is one of the other helpful things that platforms like us provide as well. Adam Stacoviak Or even just cost. I imagine over time, cost — I mean, right now you’re probably fine with it as you’re innovating and maybe you’re finding out customer fit, ability, reliability, all those things. And you’re sort of just-in-time building a lot of the stuff and you’re maybe okay with the inherent cost of innovation. But at some point you may flatten a little bit and you’re like, “You know what, if we had been running that locally for the last little bit, we just saved 50 grand,” you know? I don’t know what the number is, but the local model becomes a version of free when you own the hardware and you own the compute and you own the pipe to it, and you can own the SLA latency to it as well. The reliability comes from that. Damien Tanner And there’s some cool — there’s a new transcription model from Nvidia and they’ve got some voice models as well. And so there was a great demo of fully open source, like all voice agent platform, that was done with Pipecat — which is the Python coordination agent, open source project that I was mentioning. And they’ve got a really great pattern. They have a plugin pattern for the voice agent, and I think that’s the right pattern. And we’ve adopted a similar — and other frameworks have done that — we’ve adopted a similar pattern for us. When we rebuilt it recently, the important thing is the plugins are independent things that you can test in isolation. That was the biggest problem we had with RxJS — the whole thing was kind of, you know, those mixing kind of audio mixing things with cables going everywhere. It was kind of like that, right, with RxJS subjects going absolutely everywhere. It was kind of hard — it was hard for us as humans to understand. It was the kind of code where you come back to a week later and go, “What was happening here?” And things like, you know, oftentimes we’d end up writing code where the code at the top of the file was actually the thing that happened last in the execution of it. You know, basic stuff like that, just because that’s how the RxJS was kind of telling us to do it or kind of guiding us and how we had to initialize things. But that was one of the key things — we moved to a plugin architecture. We went to a very basic — we’ve got no kind of RxJS-style stream processing plugin. It’s just all very simple JavaScript with async iterables, and we just pass a waterfall of messages down through plugins. And it’s so much better. And we can take out a plugin if we need to, and we can unit test a plugin, and we can write integration tests and mock out plugins up and down. And we’re about to launch that, and that’s just such a game changer. And then interestingly, tying back to LLMs, we ended up here because with the first implementation we found it hard as developers to understand the code. We’d run the LLMs — they were hopeless. They just could not hold the state of this dynamic, crazy, multi-subject stream system in their head. Adam Stacoviak Context was everywhere, right? Like it was all — it was here, it was there. Damien Tanner Yeah. Even if you — I would do things like take the whole file. I was like, copying and pasting files into ChatGPT Pro being like, “You have — you definitely have all the context here. Fix this problem.” And they couldn’t solve the problem. Adam Stacoviak Fix it. Damien Tanner And part of the problem was that complexity. I mean, not having the ability to test things in isolation then meant we couldn’t have a kind of TDD loop, whether it was with the human or with an agent. And so — and because we couldn’t use agents to add features to this platform, to the core of the platform, it was slowing us down. And so that’s when we really started to use coding agents — Claude Code, Codex — like really properly and hard. We were like — I spent like two weeks just in Claude Code and Codex, and the mission was: if I can get the coding agent to write the new version of this — it was kind of not even a refactor, it had to be rewritten, start from scratch, first principles — then it will, by virtue of it writing it, understand it. And then I’ll be able to use coding agents to add features. And I started with literally the API docs for our public API, because I didn’t want to change that, and the API docs of all of the providers and models we implement with — like the speech-to-text and text-to-speech model provider endpoints — and just some ideas about, “I think we should just use a simple waterfall pipe, like pass messages through the plugins.” And that experience was really interesting because it felt like molding clay. Because I did care about — I really cared about how the code looked, because I wanted humans as well as — the agents aren’t quite good enough to build this whole thing from a prompt, but I think they will be in a year or two, right? But it did an okay job, and it needed a lot of reprompting — “refactor this, re-architect this” — but it felt like clay in one sense because, and you mentioned this earlier, you can just write some code and even if it’s wrong, you’ve kind of learned some experience. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner I was able to just say, “Write this whole plugin architecture and do it,” and it would do it, and I’d be like, “Oh, that seems a bit wrong, that’s hard to understand.” I was like, “Write it again like this. Write it again like this.” And I suddenly got that experience of throwing away code because it hadn’t taken me weeks and weeks to write this code. Adam Stacoviak It had taken you 10 minutes. Damien Tanner And I was there, just threw it away. And you still have your chat session too, so even if you had to scroll back up a little bit, or maybe even copy that out to a file for long-term memory if you needed to, you still have that there as a reference point. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. I find myself doing similar things, which is like just trust the model, throw it away and do it again if you need to. Learn the mistake, go down the wrong road for the learning, and make the prompt better. Damien Tanner And it did a terrific job. And then the bit that really got it over the finish line was then I said — I gave it this script that we used to have to do manually to test our voice agent. You know, it’s like: connect to the voice agent, say this to the voice agent, tell it to tell you a long story, now interrupt the story, you shouldn’t hear any leftover audio from the long story — like all these things, there’s like 20 different tests you had to do. I gave it that script and I was like, “Write the test suite for all of these tests.” And then it did. And I gave it all these bugs we had in our backlog. I was like, “Write tests for this.” And I just started doing TDD on our backlog, and it was great. Then I was like, “Write a bunch —” I did like a chaos monkey thing. I was like, “Write a bunch of tests for like crazy stuff the users could do with the API.” Adam Stacoviak Yes. Damien Tanner Found a bunch of bugs and issues, security issues. And then it kind of — it got it working, got a bunch of unit tests. And I was still having to kind of do a bit of manual testing. And then one day I was like, you know what, I really want — no one’s made an integration test thing for voice agents. There are a few observation platforms, observability platforms and eval platforms. So I was like, I just wanted to simulate conversations. And it’s so — that’s part of the magic, is trying something that you’re like, “This is a pain in the ass to build,” or like, “How is this even going to work?” Well, I just got it to build it. And I recorded some WAV files of me saying things, and I gave it to them. I was like, “Make an integration test suite for this and feed the WAV files like you’re having a conversation, and check the transcripts you get back.” Wow. And it did a great job. And then it was actually able to fully simulate those conversations and do all the tests. And then that — I mean, we’ve got these practices like TDD which are going to hold value, right? It was so valuable for the model, for the agent, to be running the test, fixing the test, running the test, fixing the test. And that feels a bit like magic when you get that working. Adam Stacoviak So much to cover in this journey. I’m so glad we had this conversation. I kind of feel like a good place to begin the end — not actually end — is back to this idea that is on your about page. And I just got a reMarkable, because I love to write and I really hate paper, because this thing has Linux on it. And I wrote an API that I now API to my reMarkable Pro tablet. So amazing. I’m loving this. Damien Tanner Behind me? Adam Stacoviak So you can be able to Claude Code or Codex to your tablet? Damien Tanner That’s next. Adam Stacoviak I just got it. I just got it. So like, that’s the next thing. I’m going to have this — it’s a little playground for me, basically. But it’s real time. So if you see me looking over here writing — audience, or even you Damien — I’m not not paying attention. I’m writing things down. And the one thing I wrote down earlier from your about page was “the era of the small giant,” which you alluded to, but you didn’t say those exact words. And the reason why I think it might be a good place to begin to end is I want to — I think you might be able to encourage the single developer that maybe in the last couple of months they’ve just begun to touch and not resist falling into this gravity hole, or however we describe this resistance we’ve had as developers, loving to read our own code and code review and all the things as humans, and now to not resist as much, or if at all, and just trust the model. To give them this word of encouragement towards, “Hey, you’re a single developer,” and in your case, Damien, you don’t need a DevOps. It’s not that they’re not valuable or useful, but you chose a model, a way to develop your application, solve your problem, that didn’t require a DevOps team. Give them that encouragement. What does it mean to be in this era of the small giant? Damien Tanner [80:41] I think the hardest thing is our own mindset, right? I just found this with coding agents. You start off putting in things where you kind of have an idea, you know what to expect out of it. And then you start just putting in stuff that just seems a bit ridiculous and ambitious. And oftentimes it fails, but more and more it’s working. That’s a very magical feeling, and it’s a very revealing kind of experience. And so I think we can all be more ambitious now. I think we all — and especially as engineers, we know how the whole thing works, right? There is a lot of power everyone’s been given with vibe coding. Being able to vibe code — there are a lot of security issues I think will be solved over time — but as engineers, we have the knowledge to be able to take things fully through, deploy things, scale them, fix the issues that the LLMs can still get stuck on. But we can do so much more now. We can be so much more ambitious now. And I think the thing that everyone should — every engineer should be doing now is not only trying out Claude Code and Codex and doing something new and fun. I mean, the great thing is it’s so low risk. It’s so easy to do that you can build something ridiculous and fun that you’ve always wanted to do. Adam Stacoviak Yeah. Damien Tanner You can just — and you can build something for a friend, for your wife. And that’s really exciting. And I think this Ralph Wiggum thing — very kind of basic idea — is give a spec.md, todo.md, just an ambitious task or a long list of tasks in a markdown file, and you run a shell script. And all it does is it just says to Claude Code, “Do the next bit of work. When there’s no more work to do, return complete.” And the shell script just greps for “complete,” and if it hasn’t seen that word in some XML tags, “complete,” it just calls Claude Code again. And like many of these things, it seems like a terrible idea, it seems ridiculous, but it is also incredible what it can do. And so I think that’s probably — to feel what the future is going to be like, I feel like you write down something very ambitious in a markdown file, or transcribe an idea you have that you’ve been thinking about for a while, and you set a Ralph Wiggum script off on it, and you just go for a long walk or go and have lunch. And when you come back — I mean, it’s a very exciting feeling. And as a developer, it’s very fun because then you get to go through all this code and be like, “Why did it do it?” And you’re like, “Oh, that was pretty smart. But I didn’t like that. Okay, that was quite a good idea. It messed up this bit.” But that’s — I just feel like that’s a very, very exciting experience. Adam Stacoviak Very cool. I definitely agree with that. I’m looking forward to writing that todo.md or spec.md and just going for that walk. Because I haven’t done it yet. I’ve only peaked at some of the videos and some of the demos, but I haven’t tried the Ralph Wiggum loop yet. Damien Tanner I’m gonna post on X a one-liner as well, because I think you can just then copy and paste the thing. Adam Stacoviak There’s their blog post to read, yeah. Well, I feel like with everything, I want to make it more ceremonious. Because I want to — it’s not because it needs to be, because I want to know — I want to give myself space to think of something that I think will be challenging for me, even, you know? And then give it to the thing and go away, like you said, and come back happy. I want to save space to do that when I can give it full mind share, versus the incremental 20 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever it might be that I have available to give it. I kind of want to give it a bit more ceremony, not because it deserves it, because I want to actually do it for myself. So I’m just in this constant learning scenario. It’s a pretty wild era to be a developer and to be an enabled developer. These non-technical folks that may get introduced to a terminal-like thing that’s basically just Claude in a directory, really, and ask questions and get a just-in-time interface managed to them only — that’s a really, really, really cool world to be in. And it doesn’t mean that software goes away. It just means there’s gonna be a heck of a lot more of it out there. And I do concur that maybe code doesn’t matter anymore. Maybe it won’t in a year. Maybe it won’t in six weeks. I don’t know how many weeks it’ll take. Let’s truly aim with this. What’s over the horizon for you? What’s over the horizon for Layercode? What is coming? Damien Tanner So the show release — next Wednesday you’ve got a week, given that horizon. And no one’s listening. It’s a week from now. Adam Stacoviak What’s on the horizon for you that you can give us a peek at? Is there anything? Damien Tanner We are working really hard to bring down the cost of voice agents. There is a magic number of one dollar an hour for running a voice agent, where suddenly a huge, huge number of use cases open up — whether it’s consumer applications, gaming. There are so many places where voice AI will be super valuable, super fun, and isn’t implemented yet. And with the choices we made being on Cloudflare, with the system we’ve built, we’re going to be able to bring out the lowest cost platform. I’m very excited for that. And most of all, very excited just to see voice AI everywhere. Voice AI — voice is just such a wonderful interface, right? I find myself dictating all the time to Claude Code, and you can kind of get out your thoughts so much better. And I’m excited to see how many applications we can enable adding voice AI into their application. And then we get an insight into the future of voice AI as well, with the companies that are building — a lot of them startups — and they’re building some crazy, crazy new things with voice AI on our platform. So there’s going to be some amazing stuff with voice coming out this year. Adam Stacoviak What’s the sweet spot for Layercode right now that you can invite folks to come and try? Damien Tanner Well, the great thing is we’ve got a CLI — single command you can run — and you’ll get a Next.js demo app all connected to the live voice agent. And you can get a voice agent up and running within a minute. So it’s super fun, worth trying. And then from that point, you can use Claude Code, Codex, and just start building from that. Adam Stacoviak Well friends, right here at the last minute of the very last question, Damien’s internet dropped off or something happened. I’m not sure. But it was a fun conversation with Damien. Kind of wild to be talking to somebody 17 years later after being one of the first — if not the first, I’m pretty sure the first — sponsor of this podcast. What a wild world it is to be this deep in years and experience and history in software and to just still be enamored by the possibilities. I hope you enjoyed today’s conversation with Damien, and we’ll see you next time. Changelog Our transcripts are open source on GitHub. Improvements are welcome. 💚 Bandwidth Hosting Search

Title: Despite promises that AI will create more jobs, 1.2 million jobs were actually slashed last year

Tech leaders like Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have described AI as a win-win for society; they make ambitious promises that the advanced tech will allow us to turbocharge the labor force, cure cancers, and create new “super well-paid, super interesting jobs” that didn’t exist before. But instead of feeling empowered, many workers fear their jobs are at risk of being automated—and the flood of layoffs in 2025 confirmed their suspicions. A staggering 1.2 million job cuts were announced last year, up 58% from the roughly 760,000 layoffs in 2024, according to a recent report from employment consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In fact, 2025 had the highest level of workforce reductions since 2020, and was neck-and-neck with the 2008 financial crisis, when 1.22 million roles were slashed. The biggest victims of last year’s headcount reduction bloodbath were federal workers. Extreme cost-cutting efforts from Elon Musk’s DOGE crippled entire agencies, including USAID, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In total, about 308,000 government jobs were cut last year. However, the tech industry took the heaviest blow in the private sector. Last year, tech announced that about 154,000 roles would be slashed, a 15% increase from nearly 134,000 job cuts in 2024. The culprit? Rapid AI implementation—and the industry self-correcting from pandemic-era overhiring. In 2025, AI was responsible for 54,836 layoff plans overall; since 2023, the tech has been connected to 71,825 job cut announcements. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry,” the report noted. “This coupled with over-hiring over the last decade created a wave of job loss in the industry.” In a time where the tech industry is growing fast and companies are vying to win the AI race, it might sound counterintuitive for trillion-dollar innovators to be offloading their talent. But CEOs have been open about how AI tools are taking over human skills, and they’re gearing up for more workforce changes. Microsoft let go of 6,000 employees last May, dishing out another round of 9,000 cuts in July. Meanwhile, its CEO Satya Nadella announced AI now writes 20% to 30% of the company’s code; technology that has proven to be so powerful, that the business is funding a $80 billion AI infrastructure drive. At the start of this past year, Meta also announced a 5% workforce reduction—impacting around 3,600 staffers—in an attempt to “move out low-performers faster,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. This came as the tech billionaire admitted AI was on the precipice of “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy also admitted in a memo sent out to staffers last year that the business “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” Just a few months later, Reuters reported that Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 roles. While tech layoffs are nothing new, entry-level staffers—who are already facing challenges getting their careers off the ground—will likely feel the sting of AI-related workforce changes more than others. The percentage of employees between the ages of 21 and 25 has been cut in half at technology companies over the past two years, according to 2025 data from compensation management software business Pave. These Gen Z workers accounted for 15% of the workforce at large public tech firms in January 2023; but by August 2025, they only represented 6.8%. The situation isn’t pretty at big private tech companies, either—during that same time period, the proportion of early-career Gen Z employees dwindled from 9.3% to 6.8%. “If you’re 35 or 40 years old, you’re pretty established in your career, you have skills that you know cannot yet be disrupted by AI,” Matt Schulman, founder and CEO of Pave, told Fortune last year. “There’s still a lot of human judgment when you’re operating at the more senior level…If you’re a 22-year-old that used to be an Excel junkie or something, then that can be disrupted. So it’s almost a tale of two cities.”

Title: AST SpaceMobile Bets on Blue Origin to Send Up Its Next Giant Satellite

In the race to deliver satellite-to-phone connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has announced it’ll use Blue Origin’s massive rocket, New Glenn, to send up its latest satellite next month. The plan is to launch AST’s massive BlueBird 7 satellite, also known as FM2, sometime in “late February," the company said on Thursday. The news is notable because AST SpaceMobile is betting it can use New Glenn to carry up to eight BlueBird satellites in future flights. The increased capacity promises to help the Texas startup launch between 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026; enough for the company to supply continuous cell coverage from space to users through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. Thus far, New Glenn has only completed two successful flights, and only one landed the reusable booster. Blue Origin says the AST launch will happen "no earlier than late February"; rocket launches are routinely pushed back due to weather or testing-related setbacks. Tapping Blue Origin is a high-stakes gamble, but if successful, it would help AST compete with SpaceX, which is already delivering satellite-to-phone connectivity through its cellular Starlink system. SpaceX’s offering, available through T-Mobile as T-Satellite, can already power video calls, messaging, and select apps in cellular dead zones. But the bandwidth remains constrained. Meanwhile, AST is promising superior service with “peak speeds of 120Mbps per coverage cell,” thanks to each BlueBird satellite's massive antennas. (That said, SpaceX is planning its own upgrades, slated to debut in 2027.) The company’s second-generation BlueBird spans 2,400 square feet when the antenna is fully deployed. The first second-gen BlueBird flew up last month on a rocket from India’s space agency after multiple delays. AST investors are now hoping the company can successfully launch more BlueBirds through New Glenn on schedule. The company also told the Federal Communications Commission earlier this month: "AST SpaceMobile expects four more orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with additional launches occurring every one to two months on average to reach 45-60 satellites launched by the end of 2026." In a bit of irony, AST also uses SpaceX for satellite launches. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried the first BlueBird satellites into orbit in September 2024, but New Glenn is expected to carry twice as much capacity as a Falcon 9 rocket. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What Is A Treasury Bond? Are They Going Tits-Up? Did Trump Chicken Out?

That President Donald J. Trump! In case you missed it, all weekend and as he was taking off for the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, he grunted and growled and pounded on his dumb web site about how he HAAAD TO HAVE GREENLAND, Denmark can’t protect it, how and why is it even theirs, he was going to tariff EU countries 10 percent and then 25 percent until they made Denmark give him Greenland, and tariff French wines 200 percent because President Macron refused to pay a billion-dollar bribe to be in Trump’s made-up peace club with Vlad Putin, Viktor Orban, and a pet psychic from Argentina. Whine, whine, whine!! Then while Trump was in the air, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was already in Switzerland, the US stock markets started going tits up, which is to say down, and then the Danish pension fund AkademikerPension confirmed that it would sell $100 million of US Treasury bonds out of concern over instability in the US. “It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [US] and Europe, but of course that didn’t make it more difficult to take the decision,” said Anders Schelde, the head investor, meaning that Trump’s hostile groanings and nonstop nonsensical threats made it pretty fucking easy, not to mention how the value of the dollar has been steadily plummeting since Trump took office. Poor Scott, what if the bond selloff snowballed like an Aspen orgy! Subscribe! Was Bessent’s spray-painted rubber muppet head ever in a tight spot then. He had to use his greasiest weasel words to explain to dumb reporters that once again Trump was full of shit about taking over Greenland and the threat of tariffs was just him trying to make some kind of meta-point, or something, and so everybody should just chill out, man. What BOND SELLOFF? “Denmark is irrelevant.” That smug little troll had to say some pointlessly dickish thing so all angry daddy would hear is how he really stuck it to that MEAN Denmark and all those UNFAIR JERKS at the lying Financial Times who LIED about the large asset managers they quoted who were considering dumping investments in the US from their portfolios. “I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath, do not listen to the media, who are hysterical, just like they were, just like you all were on April 2, and what happened, we had the best stock market recovery in history.” Ooh, he is so mad at those mean economists! Funds sell their bond holdings all the time, it’s no big deal. And he advised reporters on the sidelines, “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax.” Relax! Trump is, of course, the only person in the room who flies into a blind, seething rage whenever he gets told “no” about anything, and constantly says things that he does not mean, because he either knows they are lies at the time or is so batshit crazy he himself can’t tell the difference any more, and we all know there are never any consequences ever. So just chill out, guys! So much for Trump doing the tariffs because they’ll be so great for the American economy that every Cletus with a GED will be able to use AI to supervise robots building robots in the robot factory. Talk about the bond market got Bessent spooked because bond yields are the price of the debt on America’s giant credit card. US Treasury bonds and shorter-term products, T-bills and Notes, have always been considered the standard of stable kinds of investments. A bond is a bet that in 10, 20, or 30 years, the US Treasury will still exist and be able to repay with a modest but stable interest. Bonds are a perfect investment for big savings and retirement funds, and domestic funds and banks hold about 70 percent of them. Then around 30 percent of US bonds are held by foreign governments, mostly Japan, the UK, and China. Which just fell to third place; they’d already been slowly selling off their holdings. So if the US Treasury yields go up, and bond prices go down, it means fewer investors betting on the US, and more of a risk of those bonds not paying off is priced in. With the Supreme Court possibly on the verge of letting Trump fire Lisa Cook and Jerome Powell on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (but probably not; the Federal Reserve is a “special case” because the Supreme Court Six likes its money) and effectively giving himself the power to set interest rates, or convert the Treasury’s holdings into Melania NFTs if he wants, you can see where long-term investors might be coming from with that worry. Sure, the Danish pension fund’s $100 million is a rounding error compared with America’s $30 trillion of debt. But investors, especially institutional ones, by definition hate uncertainty and are easily influenced by others, and a trickle and then stampede of investors selling their T-Bonds for Chinese bonds or mutual funds in Deutschemarks or Loonies could trigger a disaster. No wonder Bessent was all a-twitter to dismiss STUPID DENMARK THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT. And so what do you know, Trump immediately backed down from the tariffs and sending US troops to mount a coup in Nuuk and start a war with NATO, saying that he would settle for “frameworks of a future deal” of some kind. And the US stock markets recovered. For now, anyway. They’ve been riding higher on demand for AI technology, infrastructure and chips and such, but according to a study from MIT, 95 percent of businesses have seen zero return on any of their investments in AI technology yet. It seems the only jobs AI robots have actually taken so far are “student who was supposed to write their own term paper,” “lawyer who was supposed to write their own briefs,” and “Adobe Photoshop child-undresser.” Up and up and up the markets now go! When will they crash, nobody really knows. [Wall Street Journal gift link / CNBC / Financial Times archive link] Share! Share Here is where you donate to keep Wonkette going forever!

Earlier this month, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said.

January 22, 2026 07:33 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Jan. 22, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, successfully completed its 1st launch of 2026 and its 80th Electron launch overall. The mission ‘The Cosmos Will See You Now’ lifted off today from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 11:52 pm NZDT (10:52 UTC). The mission successfully deployed two satellites into a 1,050 km circular Earth orbit for Open Cosmos, a first-time dedicated launch customer. This higher-altitude deployment showcased Electron’s wide payload trajectory range, maintaining its reputation as a versatile and dependable small spacecraft launch vehicle that meets diverse mission requirements. Open Cosmos, a pan-European space technology company, offers complete end-to-end satellite services, encompassing everything from design and manufacturing to in-orbit operations and solutions. Just one week after securing high-priority Ka-band spectrum, it has launched the first satellites in its new proprietary low Earth orbit (LEO) telecom constellation. This new constellation compliments the already in orbit satellites that deliver high-resolution imagery and global monitoring capabilities, supporting a wide range of applications and providing valuable metadata for diverse uses. As Open Cosmos continues to increase satellite production each year to meet growing global demand, Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle is well-equipped to support its needs. Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: "What a great way to start off the year, by welcoming a new customer and launching a mission tailored just for them. Today’s launch is a great showcase of the benefits of flying dedicated on Electron: accurate constellation deployment, streamlined access to space, and the reliability of consistently delivering mission success for our customers.” The upcoming year for Rocket Lab includes a busy manifest of Electron launches for new and repeat customers across its launch sites in Virginia and New Zealand, with Rocket Lab’s next Electron launch scheduled to take place shortly from Launch Complex 1.

Good morning. Bumping into a leading European chief executive as he left the Congress Centre in Davos last night, I asked for a take on President Donald Trump’s speech. “I think we are just tuning out of all that noise a little. Did he say anything we didn’t expect? Was there anything new?” He continued: “We are focusing on our investments, on the AI transition, on security, on our three-to-five-year plans.” He had been at a dinner the night before and that was also “the mood of the table,” American and European. There is only so long you can maintain your risk antenna at 11 on the dial—even as a chief executive. I sense the mood here at Davos was respectful of Trump but resolute in its sense that there are other pressing issues to consider. Fortune hosted a series of panels at USA House, America’s “home base” for the duration of the World Economic Forum. We heard from Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan; Robin Vince, chief executive of BNY; Kellyanne Conway, former counsellor to the president; Mark Penn, CEO of Stagwell; and Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Dalio, leaning on his decades of investment experience, urged business leaders to step back from the day-to-day and focus on the trends—conflict, indebted western governments, and major technology shifts. Trump may be playing in some of those lanes, but not in all of them. “But when you have the president of France saying that we are flirting with a world without rules, surely that will strike fear into leadership teams?” I asked him. Businesses need to sharpen up, he responded, and realize that change is with us for good. On the global stage, Europe can often appear to speak with one voice. But it is more nuanced than that. At our event at USA House, Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform party in the U.K., spoke about the reaction against globalization—a reaction he supports—and said that Trump was a success. Farage’s party is ahead in the polls. Yes, Farage did urge the president to remember the sacrifices of NATO members such as Denmark in U.S.-led conflicts in, for example, Afghanistan. And that self-determination for Greenland was the same as the American desire for freedom from Britain 250 years ago. Davos is about the nuances. It can be easy to ridicule. But for that CEO I bumped into, off to yet another dinner to discuss the transformational nature of AI, the hunt for the signal over the noise continues.—Kamal AhmedContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com President Trump, the dealmaker President Trump has taken a strong business approach to his second term, making unprecedented deals with private-sector leaders like Nvidia and institutions like Columbia University. One year into his presidency, Fortune digs deep into Trump’s record as “CEO-in-Chief.” Inside Eric Trump’s American Bitcoin Last spring, Eric Trump launched American Bitcoin, a mining venture he says is designed to help the U.S. become “the crypto capital of the world.” Fortune went inside the massive data center behind the operation to learn more about the newest arm of the Trump crypto empire. Walmart’s e-commerce play Walmart promoted David Guggina, the head of its U.S. e-commerce business, to lead its U.S. operations last week. Despite the candidate having no experience in merchandising or leading a retail store, his background in e-commerce and supply chain operations reveals where the retail giant sees its future. S&P 500 futures are up 0.61% this morning. The last session closed up 1.16%. STOXX Europe 600 was up 1.34% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.79% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 1.73%. China’s CSI 300 was flat. The South Korea KOSPI was up 0.87%. India’s NIFTY 50 was up 0.53%.

January 21, 2026 19:00 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced an update relating to the development of its Neutron rocket. As the Company pushes Neutron to the limits and beyond to qualify its systems and structures for launch, qualification testing of the Stage 1 tank overnight resulted in a rupture during a hydrostatic pressure trial. Testing failures are not uncommon during qualification testing. We intentionally test structures to their limits to validate structural integrity and safety margins to ensure the robust requirements for a successful launch can be comfortably met. There was no significant damage to the test structure or facilities, the next Stage 1 tank is already in production, and Neutron’s development campaign continues while the team assesses today’s test outcome.The team is reviewing the Stage 1 test data, which will determine the extent of the impact to Neutron’s launch schedule. The Company intends to provide an update on the Neutron schedule during its 2025 Q4 earnings call in February.

Title: Don't call it a layoff: Ubisoft issues a full return-to-office order for all employees as it confirms more studio closures are coming

I can't help wondering if maybe there's a connection. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Stuffed away in a corner of Ubisoft's latest high-speed skid off a cliff is a note for employees: "To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams." Employees who have been working remotely in any capacity, in other words, will no longer have that option: It's back to conventional office time for everyone. "This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams," Ubisoft said, explaining the decision. "In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market." In lieu of regular remote work, employees will be given "an annual allowance of working-from-home days." It seems like a small thing amidst yet another Ubisoft catastrophe, but the reaction to the announcement is strongly negative, and rightly so. Remote work, by and large, works, and after years of doing so effectively and adjusting their lives accordingly, being ordered back to the office on a full-time basis is incredibly disruptive for employees suddenly find themselves faced with a need to find childcare, pay commuting costs, and absorb other related expenses, all with no compensating increase in pay—which is to say nothing of the massive and often unnecessary pain in the ass it is. Because of that, some employees, and possibly many, simply won't do it. Which is the point: It's an effect companies have wielded strategically as a form of "soft layoffs," in which employees aren't actually laid off, but are instead presented with onerous conditions for continued employment that effectively coerces them into resigning. The term can also be applied to, for example, a "voluntary career transition program" in which employees are given the choice to either quit now with some benefits, or risk getting shitcanned later with nothing. Ring a bell? It happened recently at Ubisoft Massive, which in October 2025 offered employees "the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms," and then dropped the hammer earlier this month when not enough of them did so. And yes, more such cuts are coming: Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said today that as part of the company's latest bid to keep the lights on, it will "selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Does a return-to-office mandate fit well with a need to close studios and cut jobs? You bet it does, and we've seen it happen in the past. In 2023, for instance, a World of Warcraft producer said "Blizzard is losing amazing talent" because of Activision-Blizzard's RTO policy, and in April 2025, amidst contract negotiations with Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 member Zachary Armstrong said "underpayment and costly RTO [return to office] initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment." Ubisoft has done it too. In September 2024 the Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (SJTV) union called for a strike when Ubisoft told workers that they'd have to come into the office at least three days a week. The RTO mandate (and everything else) has sparked renewed ire from unions. Carmel Smyth, president of CWA Canada—the union representing the recently closed Ubisoft Halifax studio—said it is waiting for proof that the Halifax shutdown "was not to keep out the union," and added pointedly, "as much as the company cries poor, it did just buy a studio from Amazon in Montreal a month ago." Ubisoft is also facing an entirely predictable strike action over what the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique called a "disastrous" restructuring announcement. The union's demands include "maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions." UBISOFT - Call for strike Following the disastrous announcements made by Mr. Yves Guillemot (cost-cutting plan, projects scrapped, end of remote working, etc.), the Solidaires Informatique union is calling for a strike on Thursday, January 22, in the morning. Of course, I can't say that this is an intentional effort to shed hundreds of workers. But I can say that Ubisoft is eager—maybe even desperate—to do so, and as much as it tries to mask the maneuver in terms of collaboration and efficiency, it is what it is: Some employees will leave rather than return to the office, and that's what Ubisoft wants.

Investing Nebius Group (NBIS) secured a $19B Microsoft deal and a $3B Meta Platforms partnership over five years. Nebius projects 1,600% revenue growth by end of 2026 driven by surging AI compute infrastructure demand. Rising GPU spot prices directly boost Nebius rental revenue and margins with capacity sold out through 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Anggalih Prasetya / Shutterstock.com Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) is forecasting up to 1,600% revenue growth by the end of 2026, driven by surging demand for AI compute infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run rate in revenue of $900 million to $1.1 billion for the end of 2025 and $7 billion to $9 billion by the end of 2026, as it scales to meet hyperscaler needs. Nebius has secured major contracts, including a multi-year deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) valued at over $19 billion and a $3 billion partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) over five years. It is also expanding capacity from 220 megawatts (MW) to 800 MW and up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of connected power by the end of 2026, with contracted power reaching 2.5 GW. Despite this, some investors remain hesitant about buying the stock, but Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang just provided another reason why you Nebius Group should be at the top of your buy list. Supply of the latest generation of artificial intelligence (AI) chips remains sold out into 2026, making it difficult for companies to acquire new inventory promptly. Nvidia’s H200 chips, for instance, have seen Chinese firms place orders for over 2 million units for 2026, exceeding the company’s current stock of 700,000. This shortage stems from explosive demand for AI training and inference, which is outpacing production increases at foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). As a result, providers are negotiating additional output, with work set to begin in the second quarter of 2026. High-bandwidth memory, essential for these chips, is also constrained, with data centers projected to consume 70% of global production in 2026. This scarcity has forced companies to rent older-generation chips to bridge the gap. Two-generation-old GPUs, such as those from Nvidia’s Hopper series, are seeing increased utilization as users await further Blackwell and Rubin deployments. Providers like Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS have raised GPU instance prices by 15% in early 2026, reflecting the tight market. Benchmarks show spot rates for H100 equivalents stabilizing at $2.27 per hour in mid-January, up from December lows. Regional variations have pushed rates in Europe to $2.80 to $3.20 per hour. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Huang addressed AI bubble concerns by highlighting rising spot prices for GPU rentals. He stated: “If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it’s so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs.” Huang attributed this to real demand from new AI startups and companies reallocating R&D budgets, describing it as evidence of the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history.” This trend counters the 60% to 75% price declines seen in 2025, indicating at least a short-term rebound as delays and energy constraints limit the availability of Blackwell chips. Rising spot prices directly benefit Nebius by enabling higher per-hour charges on its GPU rentals, boosting revenue and margins. With 20% power efficiency advantages over peers and sold-out capacity, Nebius can adjust pricing dynamically during shortages. Its $19.4 billion Microsoft deal and $3 billion Meta contract provide stable baselines, supplemented by spot-market upside. Analysts project a 15% to 25% short-term revenue uplift, pushing growth over the next 12 months to 339% and potentially $4 billion-plus in annualized run rate if prices hold. Nebius’s early adoption of Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform in the second half of 2026 further positions it to capture premium demand. Nebius isn’t the only beneficiary of this trend. IREN (NASDAQ:IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) also gain from rising GPU spot prices through their pivots to AI infrastructure. IREN’s own $9.7 billion Microsoft deal and 60,000 GPU target for 2026 enable 20% to 30% revenue increases due to dynamic pricing, with 117% growth projected for the next year. CIFR’s deals with Alphabet and Amazon — totaling over $8.5 billion — support 10% to 20% increases from premium leases, with growth projected at 149%. But if you still needed a reason to commit to buying Nebius stock, Jensen Huang just gave you one. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Trump says Mark Zuckerberg showed him a ‘Manhattan-sized’ AI data center
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/21/trump-says-mark-zuckerberg-showed-him-a-manhattan-sized-ai-data-center/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T16:51:57Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump gave a surprise shout-out to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg after his address at the World Economic Forum meeting Wednesday. At a Q&A after the address, Trump recounted a moment when Zuckerberg displayed a map of a proposed AI data center facility overlaid against Manhattan. The project’s footprint, Trump noted, appeared to swallow the entire island. “Mark Zuckerberg showed me a plant where he put it over a map of Manhattan, and it was basically the size of Manhattan,” Trump told the crowd of global elites. “I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ It was miles long, miles wide, and very high. It literally covered most of the island.”Meta’s stock jumped 1.6% after Trump’s statement, paring gains to 0.9% as of press time. While Trump referred to the project as a “big plant,” he could have been referring to Meta’s Richland Parish “Hyperion” AI data center campus, which is currently underway in Louisiana and is set to open in 2030. The massive industrial undertaking comprises 2,250 acres—a landmass equal to roughly 1,700 football fields; the campus will house 4 million square feet of data center space, making it one of the largest silicon clusters on earth. However, that 4 million square feet is much smaller than Manhattan’s 22 square miles; raising questions about whether Trump was referring to a much larger project being built by Zuckerberg. Trump also marveled at the project’s $50 billion price tag, contrasting the staggering investment with traditional real estate, harkening back to his past life as a developer. That $50 billion matches the projected cost of building the Hyperion data center campus.“If you spend $500 million, you can build a good shopping center,” Trump remarked. “But how do you spend $50 billion? When I looked at this thing, I understood why.” Meta is currently transitioning from a social media company to an AI infrastructure giant, raising its capital expenditure guidance for the 2025 fiscal year to nearly $72 billion, 70% more than the previous year. Looking into 2026, Zuckerberg has warned of “notably larger” spending, with market analysts projecting that annual outlays could surpass $100 billion. The president said that AI is “massive” and driving a rapid demand for energy that requires a shift in policy. Recognizing that the aging U.S. electrical grid cannot support the two-to-five gigawatts of power that these “titan clusters” require, Trump ordered the government to step aside during his speech: He told the Davos audience that he has authorized AI companies to act as their own private utilities. So far it seems that under this new framework, tech giants will build their own on-site power plants using natural gas, coal, or oil. Trump promised to slash the bureaucratic red tape that usually bogs down such projects, making them drag on for four or five years. Instead, he pledged to deliver federal approvals for these private energy plants in just two weeks, as long as the companies build their “own electric generating plants.” “You people are brilliant. You have a lot of money,” Trump said, addressing the tech executives in the room, egging them on to start building their own plants. This industrial blitz serves as the president’s primary leverage ahead of his planned state visit to China in April. Trump has argued that American leadership in AI depends on physical infrastructure rather than just software, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping respects this rapid industrial execution. “I’ve always had a very good relationship with President Xi,” Trump said. “But we’re leading the world in AI by a lot because I’ve allowed these big companies to build their own electric capacity. We’re creating more energy than any country anywhere in the world.” China and the U.S. are widely seen to be neck and neck in the AI race, with each country emphasizing their own strengths to best the other. The U.S. leads China in AI talent, investment, and access to semiconductors, while China has the U.S. beat on AI-related infrastructure, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report. China is just “months” behind the U.S. in terms of model quality, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC. The same day Trump was speaking at Davos, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of an AI bubble while discussing China’s progress. The release of DeepSeek in 2023, in particular, he highlighted as a “major breakthrough.” Huang called China’s advance in this regard “a huge event for most of the industries, most of the companies around the world, because it’s the world’s first open reasoning model.” Since then, he explained, many open reasoning models have emerged, enabling researchers to create something that’s domain specific or specialized for their needs. In the U.S., Mark Zuckerberg has stood out for his own commitment to open-source AI, citing DeepSeek as a model.

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer After weeks of speculation following reported studio closures and rounds of layoffs, French video game publisher Ubisoft announced Wednesday it is launching a reorganization of the company that will see operations divided into five “Creative Houses,” each focused on a specific creative genre. As a result, six games in the works at Ubisoft, including the upcoming “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” remake, have been scrapped. Related Stories Kanye West Apologizes for Antisemitic Rants, Says He Got Help for Bipolar Disorder After Long Manic Episode in 2025 'Destroyed My Life' With ‘Psychotic' Behavior Teyana Taylor Says 'I'm Not Going to Abandon' Kanye West but 'I Don’t Have to Agree With Everything He Does or Says' The five decentralized houses part of the new model “will combine game development and go-to-market functions with a gamer-centric approach, and be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy as well as editorial direction;” “will be shaped by distinct creative ‘genres’ led by dedicated high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres;” and “have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.” Popular on Variety During a media call Wednesday, Ubisoft leadership would not confirm how many more layoffs (the Halifax and Stockholm studios have now been shuttered) will be coming as the 17,000-employee company is restructured, but noted details on work force reduction will be shared at a later date. Per Ubisoft, the five new creative houses include the following, the first being Ubisoft’s new subsidiary, Vantage Studios, which began operations last year: Along with the “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” remake, Ubisoft has discontinued four unannounced games and one mobile title that “do not meet the new enhanced quality aswell as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level.” Ubisoft says it will allocate additional development time to seven unnamed games in order to “ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation,” including an unannounced title initially planned to release in fiscal year 2026 that has now been delayed to fiscal year 2027. According to Ubisoft, four new IPs are currently in development, including the game “March of Giants,” which it recently required from Amazon, and the creative houses where those games will be allocated will be announced at a later date. As part of the restructuring, Ubisoft will return to a five-days-per-week in office policy for all teams, which will include an annual allowance of working-from-home days. Amid the news Wednesday, Ubisoft shared early results for its latest quarter, reporting €330 million in sales, which it says are “primarily driven by an overperformance linked to partnerships and reflecting a robust back-catalog.” The full earnings will be reported Feb. 12 as previously announced. “On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” Yves Guillemot, Founder and CEO of Ubisoft, said in a statement Wednesday. “On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences. At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.” Guillemot’s statement continues: “To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization. We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term. Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term. The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group’s short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

The American empire of Trump’s investment pledges: Heavily weighted on AI data centers and pharma. Neither of which produce economic growth on behalf of consumers. Data centers add cost to every business, including utilities and water which are heavily weighted. Water; one data center can use upwards of a million gallons daily. Electricity; one data center can use the same amount of electricity as an entire town. Pharma does not add to growth – they add to injury and death. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. These are not economic boosters – they are nightmares. Data centers are like banks – nonproducing economic drains. Defense spending needs to be cut by 70%. It does NOT add to the economy – it is a toilet emptying into a sewer. We need unimpeded trade. Manufacturing is a dying art in America. Revitalizing it without ‘workers’ is a dead fish stinking up the sewer. Trump is focusing on elites which in the long term is simply another toilet. Elites don’t produce, they don’t work. The $18 trillion in investments has been redefined as $9.7 trillion weighted between Middle East pledges with the exclusion of Israel which produces IDF mercenaries. Somehow, Japan’s initial ten-year pledge of $490 billion has ratcheted up to $1 trillion per the White House. Does Japan know? Because Japan’s government/economy is heavily indebted – ranking number one in the world at over 250% of GDP. Meta has pledged $600 billion on net equity of $182 billion. Its pledge is based on AI and ‘workforce expansion’ which has so far resulted in 4,600 layoffs and an announcement that 10% more are forthcoming. Apple has also announced major restructuring. Its balance sheet reveals current assets short roughly $20 billion compared to current assets. Net equity of $73 billion. Pledges are only as good as the air we breathe – remastered by chemtrails and toxins. The fact that Trump desperately needs adulation is indicative of a man whose façade is deception. Having been married to a psychologically diagnosed narcissist – I have become intimately aware of the traits. Pathological lying is ALWAYS one of the prominent symptoms. Middle East pledges are typically defense- and pharma-related. Like defense, pharma does not add to economic growth because it creates disease and disease means death. The White House is either grossly deluded or grossly deluding when it purports to state that these ‘investments’ have ANY positive effect on the standard of living for Americans. The biggest drivers of a good economy for consumers are built on wage growth, stable prices, low interest rates, and rising asset values – particularly housing. Wage growth has been artificially linked to false inflation numbers. Prices have risen 50% when inflation is clocked at 2%. Trump called for a 10% interest cap on credit cards to which not ONE has agreed to the ‘suggestion’. Why? Because it is not a law. It is merely a superficial request. Like a pledge. Like a pinky swear. Like – when my ship rolls in. Trump is simply Biden with a different AI projection. An illusion. Delusions of grandeur have consumed politicians and bankers and we need to extricate these human imposters before The Georgia Guidestones become our reality. Of course, the $1.598 question is – How? History answers the question. But it also reveals that the sewage has never been fully cleansed of its putrid toxins and instead humanity bought time. Before the cycle was reborn. Each time, more evil than the last. As though Hell itself was opened upon earth. This concept is being played out between Russia and Ukraine as Putin slowly comes to the realization that a peace deal on a piece of paper is meaningless. The only answer to the elimination of evil is its complete eradication. While various journalists including Seymour Hersh radically denounce Russia for not being more formidable in their destruction of humanity, Putin’s deterrence was rooted in humanity – and unless you have been assigned this military command you can’t possibly understand. Zelenskyy, Trump, Netanyahu are aligned in a psychological Babylonian construct. Killing innocent persons – for the greater good – would be Hersh’s means of ending conflict; a decision that for a true Christian is untenable in the sight of God. Hindsight is always the greatest insight. As I have stated before – when you do as they do, you become the enemy you fight. A difficult decision for a man. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: Energy Sovereignty: Federal Billions Rewire the Nuclear Supply Chain

January 21, 2026 09:09 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider - News Commentary – The North American nuclear landscape has shifted from planning to rapid execution, sparked by a $2.7 billion U.S. Department of Energy commitment to onshore uranium enrichment[1]. This massive structural realignment was further bolstered by an $800 million federal award to accelerate the deployment of small modular reactors[2], moving the industry beyond policy talk and into direct capital deployment. As the market re-rates the entire fuel cycle, several key platforms are emerging as leaders in domestic energy security, including Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’), Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU), NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), and Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF). Global investment in nuclear capacity is projected to triple by 2035, reaching approximately $210 billion as nations race toward ambitious 2050 power targets[3]. This secular transition is fueled by a new federal mandate that treats domestic critical minerals—from uranium to nickel—as vital national infrastructure[4]. In this unified industrial push, companies with execution-ready projects are being positioned to command the essential backbone of Western energy sovereignty. Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’) announced this week that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because the company is soon heading toward a NASDAQ listing under the ticker symbol NUCL through a business combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. In 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and quadrupling U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds proprietary Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) was awarded $900 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to expand its uranium enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, to include commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium. The competitively-awarded federal funding will support Centrus' previously announced multi-billion dollar expansion that will also include additional Low-Enriched Uranium production to serve commercial utilities and the existing reactor fleet, with the project expected to support 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio while retaining 150 existing positions. "This award represents a historic commitment to revitalizing America's nuclear fuel supply chain and reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global stage," said Amir Vexler, President and CEO of Centrus Energy. "I am grateful to the Trump Administration for making this commitment and to Republicans and Democrats in Congress who came together to provide this urgently needed funding." The fixed-price base task order amount is $900 million to bring new enrichment capacity online, with additional options for up to $170 million to produce and deliver HALEU to the Department. Centrus has already launched domestic centrifuge manufacturing at its Oak Ridge, Tennessee factory, with first new capacity expected online in 2029. NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) has released study results demonstrating that pairing its advanced small modular reactor nuclear technology with a heat augmentation system can provide both profitable and reliable power for commercial chemical plants. The techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory examined the performance of coupling a NuScale Power Module with a U.S. chemical facility to provide nuclear-generated steam and electric power. "As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity," said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. "As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale's scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study." The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet chemical plant requirements of 1.3 million kg/h of process steam at 400°C and 4.1 MPa while also providing 73 MW of electric power. The hybrid system's scalable architecture offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability across various configurations. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) exceeded FY-2025 guidance for finished uranium production, mined uranium ore production and uranium concentrate sales. The company's Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona and La Sal Complex in Utah produced over 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025, exceeding the top end of guidance by approximately 11%, while the White Mesa Mill produced more than one million pounds of finished U₃O₈ during 2025 with over 350,000 pounds produced in December alone. "These 2025 uranium metrics reinforce our reputation as, not only the country's lowest-cost and largest uranium producer, but as a company that delivers on its promises," said Mark S. Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels Inc. "Nuclear energy powered by uranium is among the cleanest, least expensive, and most reliable ways to supply our nation's growing energy and electricity needs." The company expects to sell 360,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in Q4-2025 at a weighted average sales price of approximately $74.93 per pound, representing 50% growth over Q3-2025 sales volumes. Energy Fuels Inc. completed two new long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear power generating companies adding deliveries for 2027 to 2032 utilizing hybrid pricing with exposure to uranium market upside. Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) was named as the second project to be advanced under Ontario's new One Project, One Process framework, reflecting the advanced state, scale, and strategic importance of the Crawford Nickel Project within Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy. The 1P1P framework is designed to better coordinate Ontario's permitting and review processes for major mining developments by aligning timelines, responsibilities, and information sharing across provincial ministries. "Ontario is moving at lightning speed to open this 100% Canadian owned mine to create 4,000 jobs for Canadian workers," said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. "In 2026, our government is going full-tilt to unlock one of the world's largest nickel deposits that will supercharge our economy and help end China's critical mineral dominance." Crawford is expected to be the largest nickel sulphide project in the western world and among the most economically significant mining developments in Canada, with independent analysis estimating the Project will generate more than $70 billion in GDP over its initial 40+ year mine life. Canada Nickel Company is targeting construction commencement by year-end 2026.

Investing NVDL has attracted $4.7B in assets by offering 2x daily leverage on Nvidia (NVDA). Daily compounding erodes returns during volatility. Nvidia posted 62.5% year-over-year revenue growth. Growth below 40% quarterly would trigger a repricing lower. Nvidia’s data center sales represent over 80% of total revenue. Next earnings report lands February 25. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / JRdes NVDL offers a straightforward but unforgiving proposition: double Nvidia’s daily return, every day. Since launching in December 2022, it has attracted $4.7 billion in assets by amplifying the defining AI infrastructure stock. Shares sit around $79, down nearly 10% year to date after NVDA slipped 4.5% through mid-January. That divergence matters. NVDL didn’t deliver exactly double NVDA’s decline because daily leverage compounds, a mechanical reality that erodes returns when the underlying stock swings sideways or trends down. For anyone holding or considering NVDL, the most important factor to watch is Nvidia’s ability to sustain revenue growth above 50% annually. That threshold matters because NVDA’s valuation premium, a forward price-to-earnings ratio around 24, depends on maintaining hypergrowth in data center demand. The company posted 62.5% revenue growth year over year in its most recent quarter ending October 2025, reaching $57 billion in sales. That pace is decelerating from the triple-digit growth rates seen throughout fiscal 2025. If quarterly revenue growth drops below 40%, expect the stock to reprice lower, and NVDL to magnify that move violently. Track Nvidia’s quarterly earnings releases, which occur roughly every three months. The next report lands February 25, 2026, after market close. Pay attention to three figures: data center revenue growth, gross margin trajectory, and management’s guidance for the following quarter. Data center sales represent over 80% of total revenue, and any sign of slowing hyperscaler spending from Microsoft, Amazon, or Google will hit the stock hard. Gross margin, currently above 75%, reflects Nvidia’s pricing power. If that figure compresses due to competitive pressure from custom AI chips, it signals eroding dominance. NVDL resets its leverage every day, which means it doesn’t deliver double NVDA’s return over longer periods. In volatile or sideways markets, daily compounding works against you. NVDA’s RSI currently sits at 40.4, down from 51.8 just four days earlier, signaling weakening momentum without reaching oversold territory below 30. If NVDA continues chopping sideways while investors wait for the next earnings catalyst, NVDL will underperform a simple 2x calculation due to volatility decay. This isn’t a flaw, it’s how daily leveraged products work. Direxion’s SOXL offers 3x daily leverage on the broader semiconductor sector through the ICE Semiconductor Index, which includes NVDA but also TSMC, Broadcom, and AMD. While more aggressive, it spreads single-stock risk across the chip industry. If you’re concerned about Nvidia-specific execution risk, like supply constraints or competitive threats from custom silicon, SOXL provides sector exposure without total dependence on one company’s quarterly performance. Watch Nvidia’s data center revenue growth and NVDL’s daily compounding behavior. Those two factors will determine whether this ETF continues amplifying gains or eroding capital through volatility.

It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew. The tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year. While Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior. Here's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026.

Net worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion Percent change: +52% After spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled. Musk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026. Net worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion Percent change: +7% Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee. Analysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago. Net worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion Percent change: +1% Zuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot. Zuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. Net worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion Percent change: +32% Huang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy. Jump to

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Δ Seven snapshots reveal how climate rollbacks altered the trajectory of U.S. energy, environmental protection, and economic security. In just one year, President Donald Trump has fundamentally changed the arc of federal climate and environmental policy. Upon returning to office 12 months ago, Trump immediately declared an “energy emergency” and promised to “unleash American energy.” He packed his cabinet with oil executives and climate skeptics who have since rolled back the climate initiatives and protections of presidents Obama and Biden while accelerating fossil fuel development. From dismantling regulations designed to cut emissions and tame pollution to repealing the country’s most ambitious climate action, Trump has reveled in reversing years of progress. He has withdrawn from both the Paris Agreement and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and undercut scientific research at every opportunity. This retrenchment came even as much of the world moved forward in 2025. Worldwide, renewables provided 40 percent of all electricity. Coal-fired power generation declined in India and China for the first time in two generations. Global clean energy investment was 50 percent higher than fossil fuel investment. Still, the United States has clearly ceded leadership in the climate fight. These seven charts reflect a year with implications that will be felt for a long time to come. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The first year of Trump 2.0 brought sweeping changes to Washington’s view of electric vehicles, and American automakers felt the squeeze. President Donald Trump and Congress took several steps to eliminate federal support for it, including eliminating the $7,500 consumer tax credit. The administration also slashed fuel-economy targets — from about 50 mpg by 2031 to roughly 35 — and eliminated penalties for automakers that miss efficiency standards. The combined effect: higher prices for many electric vehicles built in the United States, uncertainty around battery and manufacturing investments, and a weaker regulatory push that now favors hybrids and conventional vehicles. EV market share in the country, which briefly topped 10 percent in the third quarter as buyers rushed to claim the expiring credit, has since fallen to single digits. Meanwhile, the global EV industry continues to accelerate, making the U.S. retreat look like a concession to China — and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Chinese industrial policy continues driving down costs, with industry giants CATL and BYD now supplying more than half of the world’s batteries. BYD overtook Tesla as the world’s best-selling EV manufacturer, selling 2.26 million cars in 2025 compared to Tesla’s 1.64 million. In the United States, Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down, killed the F-150 Lightning pickup, and planned a pivot toward hybrids, citing federal policy changes as the primary driver. There was one bright spot in the data, though: The price gap between used internal combustion and electric vehicles is rapidly narrowing, and as of August it reached a record low of just $897. A glut of used EVs are also expected to hit the market over the next few years, which could drive prices down even further. So: The first year of Trump’s second term hasn’t exactly decimated the American EV industry, but it has transformed what might have been a sustained industrial policy push into a landscape of slow growth, rapid market shifts, and further consolidation of China’s manufacturing and battery supply chains. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How – Clayton Aldern, senior data reporter One of the more counterintuitive aspects of climate change is that cutting greenhouse gas emissions often requires more energy, not less. That’s because of electrification: Technologies like induction stoves, heat pumps for homes and factories, and electric cars all draw the grid. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence requires ever more power-hungry data centers, further straining the electrical system. Yet in the first year of its second term, the Trump administration did everything in its power to slow the rollout of renewables like wind and solar, and even stalled several offshore wind projects already under development — even as rising electricity demand made them increasingly necessary. But even against these political headwinds, green energy continued to surge. States like California and Texas kept expanding solar, wind, and storage capacity, showing that market economics outweigh federal roadblocks. Electricity demand in the United States grew 3.1 percent last year, according to energy think tank Ember. At the same time, solar generation rose by 27 percent, meeting nearly two-thirds of that extra demand. Utilities have also been building huge battery banks to store that juice for use when the sun isn’t shining: California added nearly 70 percent more storage capacity in 2024 than the year before. While it will take time to suss out the Trump administration’s impact on this energy transition, it’s clear that market forces remain a powerful driver for states that understand that a cleaner grid is a cheaper, more reliable grid. – Matt Simon, senior staff writer The Federal Emergency Management Agency often makes headlines during disasters, but in recent years it also has spent billions helping hundreds of communities prepare for future catastrophes. The agency has long doled out grants to alleviate floods in low-lying areas and weatherize against storms, and under the Biden administration it launched new programs to build resilience against climate-fueled threats like wildfires and extreme heat. These programs have provided money to elevate thousands of homes in low-lying areas, manage flammable vegetation, and upgrade sewers to handle runoff from freak storms. That effort came to a stop earlier this year after Trump vowed to shrink federal spending. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced all FEMA payments above $100,000 would require her approval, reportedly creating a billion-dollar backlog of transactions. Quarterly spending on the program fell from a peak of around $500 million under Biden to less than zero last year as FEMA clawed back money from some recipients. The agency also has halted all new approvals for resilience projects. FEMA has continued to endorse new projects that don’t have an explicit climate focus, like installing backup generators and drafting disaster response plans, but it has shut down the Biden-era Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which funded long-term investments to reduce climate-related risks. FEMA does not appear to have approved a single project under that program since Trump’s inauguration, despite a federal court ruling in December ordering it to continue the program. – Jake Bittle, staff writer The country’s bedrock environmental laws are only as strong as their enforcement. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice, working alongside their state counterparts, are responsible for protecting the public and holding polluters accountable. But over the past year, the Trump administration has dismantled those agencies with sweeping layoffs and budget cuts, undercutting their ability to fulfill their missions. More than 11,500 employees of the two agencies have been laid off or resigned, including dozens from enforcement divisions. That’s left fewer federal inspectors to track pollution and fewer attorneys to pursue violators. That pullback is already reshaping how often — and how forcefully — the government goes after polluters. Over the first nine months of both Trump’s first term and the Biden presidency, the Justice Department launched roughly 40 civil enforcement cases against polluters. During the same stretch last year, it initiated just 11. The slowdown extends to prosecutions as well. Under the previous two administrations, the number of consent decrees resulting from federal cases typically hovered around 50. Last year, that figure fell to just 24, weakening one of the federal government’s most effective tools for forcing cleanup and compliance. The retreat deepens a decades-long erosion in regulatory oversight. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, many state environmental agencies — which carry out much of the day-to-day enforcement of such laws — have seen their funding for that work slashed. Between 2010 and 2024, those budgets declined in more than half of all U.S. states, and by more than one-third in at least seven. With federal enforcement budgets also being reduced, oversight is shrinking at every level of government. – Naveena Sadasivam, senior staff writer Delivering on his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” President Trump, during his inaugural address, signaled a sweeping overhaul of federal land management. Later that day, he declared a national energy emergency and promised to fast-track domestic energy production and infrastructure “from coast to coast.” The directive marked a profound shift in the management of public land and coastal waters, with the goal of rapidly expanding fossil fuel development. In the year since, the Trump administration has targeted roughly 88 million acres that were once set aside for recreation and conservation, opening them for oil and gas development and logging. At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management, responsible for managing public lands for multiple uses and long-term sustainability, has held 22 lease sales and approved 6,027 new oil and gas permits, the highest number since 2010, according to the Center for American Progress. Some of the nation’s most sensitive landscapes are now at risk of development. The administration has, for example, moved to end protections for Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which covers 19 million acres. Other threatened areas include forestland in the Boundary Waters region of Minnesota, the high desert mesas and canyons surrounding New Mexico’s Chaco Culture National Historical Park, approximately 58 million acres of roadless wilderness throughout the national forest system, and roughly 87 million acres of unique habitat for threatened and endangered species. These moves put ecosystems, wildlife, cultural sites, and communities at risk, transforming land once preserved for the public good into resources to be exploited by industry. – Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco, Midwest regional climate reporter The Inflation Reduction Act set aside about $2 billion to underwrite clean energy and climate resilience projects for tribal nations. The Trump administration has slashed funding for such work, leaving communities scrambling for alternatives and undermining progress toward their energy sovereignty. The federal grants and incentives helped tribes build solar farms, develop microgrids, expand battery storage, and advance climate-adaptation projects on their lands. For many communities, these initiatives weren’t just about clean energy, but providing a service people elsewhere take for granted. Tribal households face 6.5 times more outages than the U.S. average and a 28 percent higher energy burden. Roughly 54,000 residents of tribal lands lack electricity entirely. Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed or frozen programs, including a $20 million grant to an Alaska village fighting coastal erosion, and, among other actions, threatened the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program that had promised $3 billion to 350 recipients. Without that backing, projects have stalled or teetered on collapse, leaving communities scrambling for private funding, philanthropic support, or loans to keep them moving forward. These cuts do more than slow the clean energy transition. They threaten Indigenous sovereignty, economic opportunity, and resilience to climate change. Tribal nations are having to reconsider their plans, seek new financing, and defend projects that were years in the making. As Washington pulls back, they are pushing forward, but the stakes for their communities, their lands, and their self-determination could not be higher. — Miacel Spotted Elk, Indigenous Affairs fellow For the nation’s farmers, 2025 was defined by uncertainty and mounting expenses as President Trump’s trade war reshaped agricultural markets. A protectionist agenda that his administration said would protect workers and lower costs instead left growers — particularly those who raise commodities like soybeans — with fewer buyers, higher bills, and an uncertain labor market. In February, Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China, along with 25 percent levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico. Further duties followed in April. China retaliated with a 34 percent tax on products from the United States; in May, it stopped buying U.S. soybeans altogether. The escalating trade war with one of the country’s biggest markets for agricultural exports hit soybean and other commodity farmers hard. It didn’t help that Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum led to higher prices for farm equipment. China resumed purchasing U.S. soybeans in October, shortly before Trump announced the two countries had reached a trade deal. But prior to that, the Asian superpower had turned to other soybean producers, including Brazil and Argentina. That move has grave environmental implications. Production of the legume is a major contributor to deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado, a biodiverse savannah in central Brazil. Last month, Trump announced $12 billion in bridge payments to help farmers recover from the financial losses they’ve incurred. However, U.S. agricultural trade groups say it doesn’t go far enough to compensate farmers and reassure them that their livelihoods won’t rocked by future trade scuffles. — Frida Garza, staff writer A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Nvidia Vs. Dogecoin: A Historic Ratio Suggests A Possible Rotation, Says Trader

Time Published: 2026-01-21T01:00:31Z

Trader Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) is arguing that an old relative-value signal is “back” in crypto markets, pointing to the DOGE/NVIDIA ratio and an unusually depressed Dogecoin RSI reading as evidence that capital could rotate from AI-linked equities into high-beta meme coins. In a post on X, Cryptollica said the DOGE/NVIDIA chart has returned to a long-term support zone that previously preceded outsized Dogecoin outperformance versus Nvidia in prior cycles. “THE SIGNAL IS BACK. IT’S HAPPENING AGAIN (2017… 2021… NOW),” the trader wrote. “The last two times this specific signal flashed on the DOGE/NVIDIA chart, we saw the biggest wealth transfer in history. The crowd is chasing the AI top. The algorithm is loading the Meme bottom. (Altcoin bottom).” The core claim is less about Dogecoin in isolation and more about positioning on a ratio between what Cryptollica framed as two cultural extremes: “You are watching the wrong chart. This is the ratio of ‘The World’s Most Valuable Company’ (AI) vs. ‘The World’s Most Famous Meme’.” From that framing, the trader leans into a cycle-rhymes narrative, asserting that the ratio has repeatedly found channel support before a DOGE-led surge. “Structure is repeating history,” Cryptollica wrote, attaching specific historical comparisons. “2017: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 100x. 2021: Ratio hit channel support – DOGE outperformed NVDA by 50x. NOW: We are back at the exact same support line.” The posts also attach a broader liquidity-rotation story that has circulated in various forms across risk markets: when one trade stops working, capital seeks the next high-beta outlet: “When the AI Bubble exhales, that liquidity doesn’t vanish. It rotates into High-Beta Speculation,” the trader wrote. “The crowd is buying NVDA at the top. The algorithm is positioning for the DOGE reversal.” In another post, Cryptollica shifted from the ratio to Dogecoin’s weekly momentum indicator, sharing a second chart highlighting RSI levels and labeling prior cycle lows. “Here you are witnessing an opportunity that only comes around once every 12 years,” the trader wrote. “Over the past 12 years (2014–2026), Dogecoin’s RSI has dropped this low only 4 times. Every single one was an epic buying opportunity.” The post describes those four moments as a sequence of cycle bottoms, including an “all-time low” first cycle bottom, a “cycle bottom + COVID crash,” a “last cycle bottom,” and “RIGHT NOW!” Cryptollica concluded with a blunt decision frame: “Math or emotions — which one decides for you?” While neither post includes an explicit price target, the analyst said in early December that he expects Dogecoin to reach $1.30 over the medium term, citing a parallel channel top on the 3-day DOGE/USD chart. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.12581. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.
