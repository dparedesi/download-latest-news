Title: Stagflation is America's most 'optimistic scenario' at this point, former Fed president says

Once painted as a worse-than-recession scenario, stagflation might now be the best that Americans can hope for with the trade war about to be in full swing. Bill Dudley, former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, says only one question remains: how bad will the damage be? Whereas a "Goldilocks economy" seemed alive and well at the start of this year, tariff policy has flipped the economic outlook in a matter of days. Writing in a Bloomberg opinion piece, Dudley said he expects devastating consequences from the White House's across-the-board tariffs. As dwindling demand derails US growth, 5% inflation is likely in the next six months, he said. Dudley added that a slowdown will occur even if Congress is able to implement tax cuts, "because there will be a considerable lag, and because low-to-moderate-income families, which tend to spend more of their income, will be hurt by tariffs more than helped by tax relief." Rising inflation in a cooling economy is the basis for stagflation. The scenario has no clear solution, making it a paralyzing situation for central banks. If central bankers raise interest rates to clamp down on inflation, they restrict economic growth. Cutting rates, meanwhile, could cause prices to spiral higher again. "All told, stagflation is the optimistic scenario. More likely, the US will end up in a full-blown recession accompanied by higher inflation," Dudley estimates. It's bound to be a no-win situation for stocks, he added. Since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Wednesday, indexes have tanked into bear market territory. "If companies pass along the cost of higher imports to consumers, inflation will be more persistent and the Fed less friendly. If they can't, profit margins will shrink and earnings will underwhelm. Not to mention the risk of foreign tariff retaliation." Of course, the Federal Reserve can hope the tariff inflation bump is temporary, an idea investors seem to agree with. Traders see the central cutting interest rates by 100 basis points through December, implying that growth will be the Fed's main concern. Dudley sees it differently. If Fed officials allow US inflation to remain above the 2% target rate — as has been the case for five years — it could amplify inflation expectations. Meanwhile, a tariff-induced productivity shock will historically impact inflation for longer, forcing the Fed to raise rates down the road. Others have taken the same stance. Rockefeller International Chair Ruchir Sharma warned that if the Fed chooses to stimulate growth with rate cuts, it would harm its reputation as a bulwark against inflation. "After missing its target for many years, it would be a mistake for the Fed to dismiss the inflation fallout from tariffs as transitory and revert once again to stimulating the economy," he wrote for the Financial Times. Not only might investors be wrong in expecting large-scale rate cuts this year, but one Wall Street heavy hitter warned that the Fed might tighten policy, instead. "This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that. I'm much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that's going to bring rates up much higher than they are today," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday. Jump to

As recession fears grow, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager thinks one is already here — and he says he’s not alone. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” BlackRock (BLK+0.51%) CEO Larry Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York on Monday, in remarks reported by CNBC. Fink referred to the airline industry as a “canary in the coal mine.” “I was told that the canary is sick already,” he said. Fink added that he thinks President Donald Trump’s tariff policies could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as it usually does during recessions, which could exacerbate inflation. “This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that,” he said, according to CNBC (CMCSA-0.78%). “I’m much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that’s going to bring rates up much higher than they are today.” BlackRock has more than $11 trillion in assets under management across private and public investments. The S&P 500 is down 12.1% since March 7, while the Nasdaq Composite is down 14.1% during that same span. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: OpenAI Eyes a Mysterious Startup Backed By Sam Altman and Former Apple Designer Jony Ive

OpenAI is reportedly mulling a deal to buy io Products, a hardware startup looking to make an A.I. device, for up to $500 million, The Information reported. io Products, which took shape about two years ago, involves several notable tech figures, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple (AAPL) designer Jony Ive. It has also attracted the attention of Steve Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The startup took shape after Altman and Ive were introduced by AirBnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky, a close friend of Altman who has previously worked with Ive’s design studio LoveFrom, which Ive launched shortly after leaving Apple in 2019. Ive spent nearly three decades at Apple honing the company’s distinct sleek aesthetic. LoveFrom engineers, many of whom also formerly worked with Ive at Apple, are in charge of building io Products’ consumer device that could aid users in everyday tasks, according to The Information. OpenAI, meanwhile, is supplying the technology. The project’s current employees include the likes of Tang Tan, who previously led iPhone product design, and Evans Hankey, who formerly succeeded Ive to lead design efforts at Apple. It’s unclear whether Tan and Hankey would join OpenAI if a potential acquisition took place, noted The Information. What exactly io Products is working on remains a mystery. The venture has stayed silent on its plans for an A.I.-powered personal product, which could reportedly take the shape of a household device. One thing is for sure: it won’t be a traditional smartphone. “I don’t think you should try to do a better phone,” Altman told Axios of the project last year. io Products is backed by Ive himself and tech investors such as Emerson Collective, the investment firm founded Laurene Powell Jobs. As of last September, the startup was reportedly on track to raise up to $1 billion by the end of 2024. Since its rise into mainstream tech in 2022, OpenAI has made efforts to expand beyond just making A.I. models. In addition to exploring a potential web browser product that would compete with Google, the company is currently finalizing designs for its own in-house A.I. chips in a bid to reduce its dependency on Nvidia (NVDA). OpenAI is hoping to begin mass producing these chips at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) by next year. TSMC also manufactures chips for Nvidia and Apple.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

ByFrank Holmes ByFrank Holmes, Contributor. Trade protectionism by the United States of America by implementing tariffs Updated, Apr. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the name of President William Howard Taft. Ouch. Global markets are in freefall in response to President Donald Trump’s universal 10% tariff on all goods being imported into the U.S., with as many as 60 countries facing “reciprocal” tariffs on top of that. When we combine all new tariffs in 2025 so far, including the raft of reciprocal tariffs announced last Wednesday, we’re looking at an average effective rate of 22.5%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. That’s the highest such rate since 1909—the same year that President William Howard Taft proposed the idea of an income tax to Congress. Average effective tariff rate in the U.S. at highest level since 1909 As I pointed out to you last month, tariffs are a type of tax paid for by domestic import-export companies, who often pass the additional cost on to consumers. This can turbocharge domestic inflation. Tariffs can also lead to full-blown trade wars, as we saw in the federal government’s previous attempts to raise revenue through the taxation of imported goods. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, enacted in 1930, is widely believed to have exacerbated the effects of the Great Depression, as global trade tanked a whopping 65%. A few decades prior, then-Representative William McKinley’s tariff act triggered retaliation from other nations, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers. (If you need to brush up on your Smoot-Hawley history, I recommend the famous “Anyone? Anyone?” scene in 1986’s “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” which you can watch here.) As was the case then, we’re already seeing retaliatory tariffs. China announced today that it will impose a 34% duty on all goods imported from the U.S. If this weren’t enough, automobile imports face a steep 25% tariff. Trump claims he “couldn’t care less” if foreign manufacturers raise prices for U.S. consumers, and from the looks of it, they may need to—and significantly so, in some cases. Mitsubishi, for instance, will need to increase the price of its vehicles by more than 20% here in the U.S. to offset the new levy, according to estimates by CLSA. Price increase needed to offset a 25% U.S. tariff on autos The manufacturer expected to fare the best under this tariff regime is Tesla, whose supply chain is well-integrated in the U.S. More than 62% of the company’s facilities are located domestically, with approximately a quarter of its suppliers also based in the U.S., according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, fewer than half of Ford’s facilities worldwide are currently located in the U.S. This could be constructive for Tesla, whose stock has lost over half of its value since its peak in mid-December, making it one of the worst performers of the year so far. The carmaker’s quarterly sales fell a significant 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due mainly to political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. When it comes to new home purchases, bad economic news could be good news. Mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 4% on Friday due to concerns about the trade war. Bond yields generally fall when prices rise. 10-year yield plunging on trade war fears Granted, home prices in the U.S. are still hovering near record highs, but current homeowners may be able to refinance sooner than expected. Lower yields are also good for gold. Because it’s a non-interest-bearing asset, gold starts to look more attractive as yields fall, especially when inflation remains historically elevated, as it is now. The 10-year yield is nominally 4.1% right now, but when you factor in the 2.8% headline inflation rate from February, the real yield is closer to 1.3%. If yields fall further or if inflation jumps higher due to tariffs, we may end up with negative real yields, which have historically been bullish for gold prices. The yellow metal is trading down as it’s swept up in the broader selloff, and I believe investors should strongly consider buying these dips. Gold just notched its best quarter since 1986, ending the March quarter at $3,123 per ounce, and there could be further upside momentum. Gold notched its best quarter since 1986 I believe the number one thing investors can do at this moment is to remain calm and not panic. Last week, I attended and spoke at the Oxford Club’s Investment U conference in Florida, where many presenters offered their own advice to those who may be worried right now, especially those nearing retirement age. Dr. Nomi Prins, founder of Prinsights Global, told the audience that now may not be the time to obsess over your 401(k). No need to check it every minute. My favorite piece of advice came from my friend Alexander Green, the chief investment strategist of the Oxford Club. Green reminded the audience of America’s exceptionalism, which is no less true today than it was before markets started crashing. “If we’re no different from other Western democracies,” Green said, “why were transformative companies like Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, Netflix, Snapchat, Instagram, Tesla, Uber, Crispr and NVIDIA—to name just a few—all found here?” Green is currently working on a book on America’s exceptionalism, which I’ll be sure to pick up once it’s released. You can read my two-part interview with him from 2017 here and here. Warren Buffett, the perennial optimist, has always urged investors to look beyond the current crisis and to follow the trendlines, not the headlines. In his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he wrote that “major declines” can “offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped by debt.” He also paraphrased lines from the British poet Rudyard Kipling’s famous poem “If,” which I’ll end with today: If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs… If you can wait and not be tired by waiting… If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim… If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you… Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Further 20% Market Drop Is Possible

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market could see another 20% drop, but that the current drawdown is a buying opportunity in the long term as the current situation doesn’t pose systematic risk. “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity, but that doesn’t mean we can’t go down further,” Fink said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. He noted that inflationary pressure is higher than market participants expect and that many already believe the U.S. to be in a recession. As a result, he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. Last month, Fink published a letter to shareholders, warning about Bitcoin’s (BTC) threat to the U.S. dollar, which could weaken if Americans believe the cryptocurrency to be a safer asset than the dollar. Markets, including the crypto market, have been in turmoil since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a host of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. BTC is currently trading 5% lower over the past five days and 11% lower in the past month. Stocks were hit even worse with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 13% and 15%, respectively.

Title: Business leaders speak out against Trump's trade war with the world

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Major figures in the business world have spent the last 48 hours sounding alarms about the economic consequences of President Donald Trump’s trade war — some even reversing their previous supportive stances. While many small businesses across the United States have for months decried Trump’s policies and the uncertainty they’ve injected into their operations, last week’s tariff rollout stunned America’s C-suites. In a CNBC flash survey of CEOs published Monday morning, 69% expected a recession, with 37% saying they expected to cut jobs this year. “Disappointingly stupid and illogical,” one CEO said in describing Trump’s tariffs to CNBC. “Without faith that our government knows what it is doing, it is impossible for businesses to thrive.” Speaking in a televised interview with Bloomberg, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed the sentiments of the survey. “Most CEOs I talk to say we’re in a recession right now,” he said. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump’s tariffs would “slow down growth” as “input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.” On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%. Dimon’s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to “get over” Trump’s tariff policy because they were “good for national security.” But he isn’t the only business leader changing his tune following steep market losses and a myriad of recessionary indicators. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said in an X post Monday morning that “the global economy is being taken down because of bad math,” capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump’s policy team. The Pershing Square CEO also said that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “profits when our economy implodes,” a statement he walked back hours later. “This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman, who also had officially endorsed Trump last summer. On Sunday, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said in a rare post on X — in response to another user posting a January interview on trade policy — that “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear.” Richard Branson, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Virgin Group, called on the Trump administration to “own up to a colossal mistake and change course” before the economic fallout spreads. “As the dollar is weakening, US consumer prices will rise,” Branson continued. “And countless small and medium-size enterprises will go, and already are going, bankrupt as a result. This is not a winning long-term strategy.” The uneasiness has even spread to Trump’s own circle of advisers. In what appears to be his first major break with the president, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a seemingly anti-tariff video on X on Monday morning featuring an economist lauding the “operation of the free market.” Musk also said Saturday during a speech at an event held by Italy’s right-wing co-ruling party that “Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and America.” In response, Peter Navarro — largely seen as the architect of Trump’s tariff policy — dismissed Musk as a “car assembler” in a CNBC interview Monday. “He’s a car person,” Navarro said. “That’s what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.” J.J.

Title: The bulls are in full retreat: These charts show the carnage on day 3 of a stunning market plunge.

The most reliable bulls on Wall Street are ringing the alarm bells as President Trump's tariffs plunge markets into chaos. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday, following the footsteps of the Nasdaq 100, which closed in bear territory on Friday. The three-day decline has grown to as much as 14%. These charts show just how painful the market implosion has been. The S&P 500 peaked at 6,144 on February 19, putting the bear market "line in the sand" for the benchmark index at about 4,915. The index hit an intraday low of 4,835 on Monday. What were the stock market's biggest winners over the past decade turned into the biggest losers so far this year. Year-to-date, Tesla is down 43%, Nvidia is down 30%, Apple is down 27%, Alphabet is down 23%, Amazon is down 21%, Microsoft is down 16%, and Meta Platforms is down 14%. The Hang Seng Index plunged 13.2% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since 1997. Investors aggressively sold shares on fear of an escalating trade war between the US and China. On Friday, China retaliated against the US with its own tariffs on US imports. Oil prices were already depressed over the last year, but the rollback of OPEC production cuts and fears of an economic slowdown have hammered US and global crude prices, with the commodity down 15% in three days. A potential recession would reduce demand for the commodity just as supply is increasing. Meanwhile, some of Wall Street's most enduring bulls have been forced to change their tunes as the sell-off ramps up. Here's what the three commentators have to say amid the market chaos: "If these tariffs (in current forms/rates) hold there is no debate… it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner… and we see no debate," Ives said in a note on Saturday. Ives has historically been an ardent tech bull, able to see the silver lining even in some of the most dire market scenarios over the last few years. But even for him, the trade war is hard to sugarcoat. "In one day this tariff policy if enacted will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs, major Cap-Ex delays due to uncertainty, and slow down US tech innovation… not a debate." "These reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit converted into some odd calculation) implemented would cause an economic Armageddon and stop the US tech world in its tracks...and wipe out a bright future ahead in one global policy mistake that will reverse US tech dominance in our view." "The resulting market fury is not due to a reaction to a trade war, but rather, in our view, the fact the White House broke a core covenant of capitalism — stable and predictable regulatory environment," Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Sunday. "The White House's sudden and aggressive executive orders left companies without the predictability they need to recoup capital investments, prompting vocal corporate backlash." Lee has often used stock market declines as moments to highlight opportunities for investors, but not this time. He highlighted the pain set to hit companies like Apple, which Lee noted is facing a 54% increase in production costs as a result of the tariffs on China. The result would be effectively nationalizing a third of its assets by redirecting its gross margins into tariff revenues." "On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN interview with Peter Navarro. The President's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same," Ed Yardeni said in a note on Saturday. "I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Wall Street matters a great deal to Main Street. Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0." "The President wasn't negotiating trade deals this weekend. He was too busy relaxing on the links." Jump to

Title: Vaio is advertising ‘tariff free’ laptop prices for a limited time

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Unless you’re a real stickler for the finer points of the consumer tech industry, you might not know the history of the Vaio laptop series. But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump administration’s massive tariffs, you’d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few “tariff free” laptops. To address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business about a decade ago. It’s currently majority-owned by Japanese retailer Nojima. At the moment, Vaio offers three different series—the SX, SX-R, and FS—in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. The designs are unremarkable and don’t often get spotted even on big retailers, but it looks like they’re getting some love from Costco as a US sales partner. According to Tom’s Hardware, the Vaio brand sent out emails to some customers hoping to lure them in with “Tariff Free Inventory.” While it doesn’t go into specifics, this is undoubtedly a reference to US president Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs on nearly every country that supplies finished goods and raw materials to the United States. This sent stock prices and other economic indicators into a tailspin, in what’s already being referred to as “the 2025 stock market crash.” For the Japanese Vaio brand, which manufactures all its current models in a Nagano factory, the relevant tariff is the 24 percent tax on products from Japan, according to Reuters. Depending on how the tariffs are implemented on specific components, the 34 percent tax on goods from China and 32 percent tax on goods from Taiwan may also come into play for laptops sold in the US. In the best-case scenario, Vaio’s cheapest laptop at the moment will jump from $1,100 to $1,364, assuming Vaio passes the cost directly onto retailers and final buyers. For the SX-R mentioned in the “tariff free” email, the starting price would jump from $2,200 to $2,728 for the same model. For more estimations on how tariffs will affect consumer electronics prices, check out this breakdown. The prices on the Vaio website as of April 7th don’t seem to have changed much since January, as seen on the Internet Archive. It seems like a safe assumption that Vaio is promoting prices for current inventory held within the United States, which can be sold at today’s prices without fear of tariffs affecting profitability. It’ll be a few weeks before the latest round of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the United States start impacting finished items being sold to consumers. If you’re in the market for a new laptop in the US, you might want to look for one right away. As Vaio demonstrates, there’s only a limited amount of computers in current supply line that can be sold at pre-Trump prices.

Title: Even Realities G1 review: Limited but effective smart glasses
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=176954735

I appreciate devices that don’t try to do too much. There are too many products throwing too many features at the consumer in the hope one or two sticks. I’m reminded of the recently revived Pebble, which offers a pared down way to check your phone’s notifications from your wrist, and little else. That’s the best way to describe Even Realities’ G1 smart glasses, which puts a second screen for your smartphone on your face. G1 is almost aggressively low-tech, putting in your line of sight a dot matrix display that’ll leap into life when required. You’ll be able to see the time, phone notifications, calendar, stock and news updates from a handful of chosen publishers. Tap the temple tips (also known as earpieces) and you’ll be able to speak to an AI to answer questions or dictate a note without touching your phone at all. Open the app to activate heads-up turn-by-turn directions, access real-time translation and use the glasses as a portable teleprompter. On devices like this, the limited feature set goes hand-in-hand with lowered expectations: If it promises the basics and delivers them, all good, right? Problems arise when it fails to do them well, or if it’s obvious to anyone there are features that would work here but have been omitted. The G1 doesn't stumble on the essentials, but I do find myself flip-flopping about how much praise they should get. They’re useful right now, but I’d love to see how much better they’ll get in a year or two. Until the laws of physics change quite dramatically, smart glasses will always be noticeably bigger and heavier than their siblings. But the G1 is hardly an embarrassment in those stakes, and while chunky, they’re not comically oversized. The frame is built from magnesium and titanium alloy and weighs in at 44 grams. That’s more than the 26 grams my regular glasses weigh, but not to such an extent that it’s burdensome. It’s no surprise to learn some of the company’s leadership team came from the glasses industry, including stints at high-end eyewear brand Lindberg and Mykita. Each lens houses a rectangular waveguide with a 25-degree field of view displaying a 640 x 200 20Hz dot matrix green monochrome screen. It brings to mind the old workstation terminals from the early 1990s. This isn’t shameless hipsterism, since green is more easily seen by the eye, and it also reduces the display’s power consumption, which is useful since the maximum brightness is 1,000 nits, and you’ll need all of it to see your screen on a bright day. Much of the hardware is housed in the temple tips — the bits sitting behind your ears, if you’re not au fait with glasses terminology. These chunky boxes include the wireless charging gear, 160mAh battery, Bluetooth LE 5.2 radio and the touch control sensors. As for the rest, the projector and microphones are housed in the end pieces (the hinges on the frame), and that’s it. There’s no camera, speakers, headphones, bone conduction audio or any touch surface along the arms themselves, because the makers expect you to have your own camera and audio gear. In the box, you’ll get the glasses and USB-C charging case, the latter of which has its own 2,000mAh battery which the company says will charge your glasses two and a half times before you need to head back to a socket. You can also get a pair of clip-on sunglass lenses for your specs to ensure you can wear them outdoors. I had initially presumed, given the heft of the original investment, that the clip-on glasses were thrown in but no, they’ll set you back an additional $100 in the US, €100 in Europe or £85 in the UK. Glasses need to be up to the challenge of withstanding the same conditions the rest of your head is exposed to. Even Realities says the G1 can resist a “splash" or "light rain,” but doesn’t include a specific IP rating, so you may need to baby them a little. There is only one size of the G1 available, and the company says it’ll suit anyone with a pupillary distance between 54 and 80. The temples can be adjusted to go looser or tighter, depending on the unique topography of your skull. But the frames are fairly stylish, and if you prefer the rounded “Panto” style of glasses, or a squarer one, you can opt for the B1 model instead. Naturally, glasses aren’t a one-and-done deal, with most folks changing their prescriptions on a bi-annual basis. Even Realities says that you should be able to send your glasses back to HQ when your eyesight changes, along with your updated prescription, for up-to-date lenses. In the EU that’ll cost €230, or if you’re further abroad, €240 ($260). I’ve deliberately not referred to the G1 as a pair of augmented reality glasses because I don’t think they fit the description. The dictionary says AR is anything that puts a digital view in front of the real world, but that’s too broad a definition. After all, if I held a paper map in my line of sight I wouldn’t be augmenting my reality as the map doesn’t engage with its environment. And it’s the same thing here — just because the display in question is transparent doesn’t, for me, move the needle enough for it to be classified as AR. Charge the glasses, download the app and you’ll walk through the brief setup and tutorial process. Software updates take around five minutes each time, surprisingly long given the low-tech nature of the system. Put the glasses on and you’ll notice the waveguide prisms add a slight tint to whatever you’re looking at. For instance, when staring at a white page on my computer, the prism adds a hint of gold that’s noticeable compared to the white around it. The glasses are deactivated by default, behaving like any regular pair of specs as you go about your day. If you want to look up at the dashboard, which is your home screen, you’ll need to tilt your head up. This is the first thing you’ll define in the settings: How far you need to move your head up to trigger the dashboard. I found I had to tweak it regularly, given my head naturally drift upwards more often when I'm, say, relaxing against the sofa versus standing at my desk. The dashboard is the first sign the G1 has some limitations. You only have three layout options for what you can see, one of which is the Status Pane, which is always on. Status shows you the time, date, temperature, a notification indicator and (when required) low battery warnings. You can add one widget or two, but if you pick two, one of those widgets will default to your calendar. The other widgets include News, Stocks, QuickNotes or a Map. News, Stocks and Maps feel like the default options you get with every gadget while its makers work out what its users really want and need. The news feed pulls from a handful of outlets and you can select from which categories (Politics, Science, Sports and the like) you want to see. The map view gives you a little peek at your location to the nearest 25, 50 or 100 meters, which I’m sure is helpful for some folks, like delivery drivers. But I’m not sure there are many folks who want or need to have this information so immediately at hand. Notifications You’ll be able to gatekeep which apps you can permit to be put through to your glasses, and when you get a message, a speech bubble will pop up on your blank display. When it appears, you can just flick your head up to see the message, or tap the temple tip while in Dashboard. It’s the same limited message you would get with any basic wearable connected to your iPhone. The obvious benefit is removing the need for you to get your phone out of your pocket or look at your wrist. On a Saturday jaunt into the city, several of my group chats sprung into life and I was able to keep abreast of the conversation without having to look at my phone. That was a real benefit, as I’d have been frustrated if I’d have had to check my pocket on the regular for messages that didn’t entirely concern me. The only downside is that you can’t do anything with the messages, like respond to them, unless you do finally succumb to your phone. Teleprompt, Transcribe and QuickNote Even if you’re comfortable speaking off the cuff, using the G1 as a teleprompter is a staggeringly good idea. As soon as I started using it, I was thinking they would be great for shooting review videos, as well as giving presentations and acting. Hell, I’ve recited the Gettysburg Address a few too many times in the last week. The glasses will also offer a way to turn what it’s hearing into text, either with the dedicated Transcription setup, or the QuickNote action. For the latter, all you need to do is touch a temple tip and you can then speak, with the system picking up your words and turning them into text. You’ll then be able to read the note, and play back the audio recording in the app, although you can only share the text of what you’ve said. It’s perhaps a lot more pertinent to journalists than other folks but the ability to have such easy access to a tool like this is exciting. Translation The G1s presently support real-time translation of 24 languages, including the major European languages, Arabic, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. After you open the app, select the language in question and activate the feature, you’ll get a translation two or three seconds later when someone talks to you. I’ve tested the feature with native French and Turkish speakers and while the translations did at times miss a word, the overall sentiment was well conveyed. Without a doubt, this is one of the glasses’ most eye-catching and useful features, since it subtitles the real world. But while the idea and implementation is all there, it’s not as sci-fi perfect as it could or should be, and that’s a problem. For a start, there’s the obvious moment you have to wait for while the system translates what your counterpart has said. Then there’s the fact it’ll translate anything it can hear, so when I asked my Turkish friend to speak to me, and then I read out the translation in English, the glasses tried to translate my response back into English. Everything’s far more reliant on the app than it could be — you can’t activate the feature or swap languages without having the phone in your hand. If you were able to switch the options around with a tap on the touch sensor, you could theoretically have a conversation just with the glasses. But as soon as you need the phone in your hand, it’s easier to just open up Google Translate and harness the power of conversation mode. Navigation The ability to project basic information in your line of sight is enormously helpful when it comes to navigation. After all, if you’re wandering around unfamiliar streets, then you probably don’t want to appear to look like you’re lost. Certainly, the spate of phone thefts where well-prepared poachers snatch devices from people’s hands is a sign of that. Much like every other feature, you’ll start by opening the app, activating the navigation pane and setting your destination. You can pick walking or cycling directions, and you’ll get a turn-by-turn layout on the phone as well as in the glasses. Once the route has been calculated, which will take a second, you can put the phone in your pocket and start moving around. On the left, you’ll get the road name, an arrow for your direction and the distance in meters before the next move. In the middle, you’ll get the projected journey time and distance, and on the right a mini-map showing you the route. Look up (triggering the Dashboard) and you’ll get a full sized route map showing your progress as well as an indication of your speed. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t adore this feature and would love to test it out while roaming an unfamiliar city, because it’s supremely effortless. Even AI Rounding out the spec list is Even AI which, at the tap of the left temple tip, will be available for you to ask questions. Even AI is essentially just an interaction layer for either Perplexity, which is the default AI client, or ChatGPT. Press the button and you’ll be able to ask it questions, the answers of which will then be displayed in your field of view. If you have a beginner’s knowledge of AI, by which I mean a fundamental distrust of anything it says, then this might be useful. Defining words, answering basic questions like “Who is Florence Nightingale” and looking up facts like the price of Bitcoin are all easily done. But that’s all, I think, I’d trust any AI to do, given how generally incapable of providing useful information it is. Controls There are two buttons, one on each temple tip, which will let you engage EvenAI or QuickNotes and scroll through notifications. Two buttons, however, even with the ability to accept multiple taps, is a little too few input mechanisms for a device this sophisticated. I keep thinking about the ways you can control true wireless headphones with all of that rhythmic tapping and that’s just for audio playback. It means you’ll be relying on your phone a lot more than you may like, and while it’s not a deal breaker, it is an issue. After all, if these glasses offer a way of spending more time engaging with the world around me, then I don’t want to be constantly snatching up my phone. I imagine this is another area that, as the software develops and more commands can be incorporated into the buttons, things will get easier. But it is, for now, a fairly significant frustration. I’d consider myself a fairly heavy user, and I would regularly get a day and a half’s worth of life from the G1 glasses before needing a recharge. It’s vexing in the extreme that the glasses don’t have an off switch, so they’ll be draining an admittedly small amount of power when not in use. I suspect, if I was living with these full time, I’d get into the habit of keeping them in their charging cradle on the nightstand while in bed to avoid any inadvertent losses of power while out and about. Even Realities’ G1 is available in two different frame styles: The G1A with the “panto” round-rim style and the G1B, with a rectangular frame. If I’m honest, I’d have preferred to test the G1B, which is more in keeping with my regular glasses preference, but c’est la vie. The glasses on their own cost $599, with corrective lenses costing you an extra $150 and the sunglass clip an additional $100. It puts these glasses in the same sort of territory as the highest-end designer frames you can get at LensCrafters. I’m not sure there’s a mainstream competitor sitting in exactly the same category as the G1. There are similar headsets, like TCL’s RayNeo, but that has a far higher resolution display since it promises real AR. The Frame by Brilliant Labs, perhaps, but that only has a display in one lens and relies far more upon AI to operate. Captify’s glasses use binocular vision but are only designed to offer real-time captioning for users with hearing loss. Vuzix’s Z100 only has the display in one lens and, as far as I understand it, Meizu’s Myvu glasses are only available in eastern countries. Which means, for now, Even Realities is your one stop for a product like this. And while they’re not in the same category at all, it feels negligent to not even mention Meta and Ray-Ban’s Wayfarers. The retail price may be cheaper but, once you’ve added prescription lenses they’ll set you back around $600, putting them close to the G1. But they’re obviously a very different product, with no heads-up display and a greater emphasis on AI and photography. I really like Even Realities’ G1 for what they can do right now, but I’m also hopeful that it’ll get far more useful in the future. It seems to me there are so many things that could be tweaked, primped and plumped to make these far more appealing. I’d love to be able to switch the translation mode with a press of the temple tip, so I could get a translation of what’s said, flip it to translate my English to the other language and then say it back to them so we could actually have a(n admittedly stilted) conversation. Adding reminders and other options to the dashboard would make it a lot more desirable to use. Hell, imagine a future dashboard update that pulls your step count from your phone so you can see how well you’re moving. Not to mention the ability to offer some form of real-time captioning for users who may have hearing issues. I’m not going to judge the G1 on its potential but for what it offers now, and what it offers now is plenty good enough. The biggest obstacle is the price, but what can you expect for a first generation product in a niche category? When speaking to friends about them, many said if the price wasn’t that much more than a regular pair of glasses, they’d struggle to say no to what’s on offer here. And I agree, once you’ve had a taste of the functionality that’s on show here, it’s hard to go back to normal.

After some time away, the head of UiPath is placing a big bet on agentic AI being the future of automation. by Nilay Patel After some time away, the head of UiPath is placing a big bet on agentic AI being the future of automation. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Daniel Dines, the cofounder and, once again, the CEO of UiPath, a software company that specializes in something called robotic process automation (RPA). We’ve been featuring a lot of what I like to call full-circle Decoder guests on the show lately, and Daniel is a perfect example. He was first on Decoder back in 2022, right before he moved to a co-CEO arrangement with Rob Enslin, a Google Cloud executive brought on to help steer UiPath after it went public. In January of last year, Daniel stepped down to become chief innovation officer and Rob stepped up to become sole CEO — and then, less than six months later, Rob resigned, and Daniel took his job as sole CEO back. Founders stepping aside for outside CEOs and then returning as CEO later on is quite a trope in the tech world, and Daniel and I spent a while pulling his version of that story apart. He made some pretty key decisions along the way to relinquishing control of the company he founded — and then some equally important decisions when coming back. If you’re a Decoder listener, you know I’m fascinated by the middle part of these stories that usually gets glossed over, so we really dug in here. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! But there’s a lot more going on with UiPath than C-suite shuffles — the company was founded to sell automation software. That entire market is being upended by AI, particularly agentic AI, which is supposed to click around on the internet and do things for you. The main technology UiPath has been selling for years now is RPA, which has been around since the early 2000s. It aims to solve a pretty big problem that a lot of organizations have. Let’s say you run a hospital with ancient billing software. You could spend millions upgrading that software and the computers it runs on at great risk, or you could just hire UiPath to build an RPA system for you that automates that software and presents a much nicer interface to users. This decreases the risk of upgrading all that software, it makes your users happier because they’re using a much nicer interface, and it might provide you some efficiency by developing new automated workflows along the way. UiPath built a fairly successful business doing that basic version of RPA; I encourage you to listen to our episode in 2022 where we unpack it in great detail. But as you might expect, that’s all getting upended by agentic AI systems that promise to automate things in much more powerful ways, with much simpler natural language interfaces. So Daniel has to figure out how UIPath can integrate and deploy AI into its products — or risk being made obsolete. Daniel and I really got into that, and then I also wanted to push him on the practical economics of the business. The big AI startups like Anthropic and OpenAI don’t have to make any profits right now. They’re just raising mountains of investment and promising massive returns when all of this AI works. But UiPath is a public company, and it’s licensing this technology at a cost. So I wanted to know what Daniel thought about the cost of licensing AI tech, selling it to customers, and trying to have all of that make a profit while the underlying economics of the AI industry itself remain pretty unsettled. We also talked about what all of this might mean for our experiences at work, and whether a world of robots sending emails to other robots is actually a good goal. This one really goes places — Daniel was game to truly dig in. I think you’ll like it. Okay, UiPath CEO Daniel Dines. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Daniel Dines, you’re the founder and — once again — the CEO of UiPath. Welcome back to Decoder. Thank you so much for having me, Nilay. I’m very excited to talk to you. I love a full circle episode of Decoder. You were last on the show in the spring of 2022. It’s been a little bit of a roller coaster since then. You were just about to have a co-CEO named Rob Enslin. You hired him from Google Cloud. Then, you stepped down a little over a year ago to focus on being the chief innovation officer. Then, Rob was the sole CEO. Then, Rob stepped down, and now you’re CEO again. You’ve made some changes to the company. Explain what’s going on there, because that’s a lot of decisions. Obviously, we’re a show about decisions, and there’s a lot of AI stuff I want to talk about. But let’s start with that little bit of history. Why step down and why come back? Well, roller coaster is a good word. Sometimes people exaggerate with it, but in our case, it’s really what happened. Why? Look, I was always trying to do what’s best for this company. This company is, in a way, my baby. I spent almost 20 years [building it]. This year, 2025, is 20 years since I founded UiPath. I thought that if we can get the best talent, and especially with [Enslin’s] background in go-to-market, this is going to help us. And Rob is a nice guy. We got along pretty well. And look, it’s been mostly a good ride. It gave me some time off, so I switched to chief innovation officer. I ran our product and engineering teams. In 2023, I had my own time for reflection, especially after I moved a lot of my responsibilities to Rob. I spent that summer in reflection mode, honestly, with a bit of soul searching around “what do I want?” I would say that I missed my early 20s craziness, with people having a lot of fun and going on spring break. I had to work. In post-communist Romania, there was a lot of turmoil, so life was not that fun for me at that stage. I thought maybe I will get to experience what it means to take it a little bit easier. It was important for me because I discovered that UiPath is actually kind of an anchor for me. It gives me a framework of mind, a direction. It’s very hard for me to wake up every day and give myself something to do unless I am in this big machine and this machine is on a trajectory. It forced my mind to be there. And I’m surrounded by great people. I talk to smart investors, analysts, customers, and partners. It’s a living organism. So, I discovered that this is a gift that I have, being in the position to run this company. Then, things in early 2024 didn’t go well for us, from an overall market perspective. I think the macro was pretty bad for some companies. We had some execution issues. Our initial go-to-market was “land and expand,” and we over-rotated the company to go mostly after big deals. So, our float business suffered, and paired with some of the macro challenges, it created a difficult environment. Rob decided to leave the company in May 2024. In all fairness, at the time, I was ready to take it back. It came faster than I anticipated, but mentally I was prepared after my summer and my time off. Did you go on a spring break? Did you take a minute? Were you in Palm Beach? No, no, I didn’t go to Palm Beach, but I spent a few weeks in the Mediterranean on a boat. So maybe close to it. Spring break is not the same in your 40s as it is in your 20s, is the thing that I’ve discovered. Yeah, exactly. I always want to drill into the actual moments of change. I always joke that I watch a lot of music documentaries. There’s act one where everyone’s in the garage, and there’s act three where they’re playing Shea Stadium. And act two, where the actual moments of change happen, are often glossed over. This is one of those moments. You made a decision to come back as CEO, Rob made a decision to leave. What was that conversation like? Did you initiate it? Did he start it? Was he leaving and you already decided that you were coming back? Walk us through it. It was simple actually. We decided to meet in New York following Q1 2024. He told me that he thought it was better that I take the company back and he resign for personal reasons. Indeed, he needed to take some time off because some members of his family were not well. I told him, “Let’s reflect a bit on this. Let’s think a bit.” But in the end, he was resolute in his decision. I also realized after that discussion that there will be many changes in the company. We needed to contract a bit. We oversized the company for this elephant hunting, so there needed to be a few changes. And I realized it’s actually better that I do the changes. It’s going to be a lot of pain, and we’ve already been through some pain. The last three quarters were not easy for us by any metric. Would you have made the change if he hadn’t volunteered? Was it obvious to you that you were going to come back as CEO? I realized something. It would be difficult to get an external CEO while I am here. It’s kind of not possible. I would consider growing someone internally rather than bringing in someone externally. It’s really hard to know someone after you talk for a few hours and you go for a dinner, and it affects the culture of a company so much. Even if I have the controlling stake of the company, it’s not like you get someone and you can command them every day, “You do this and this and this.” No, it has a really huge implications. I care deeply about the company and the people. Rob had all the best intentions in the world, but seeing the things that sometimes made me uncomfortable, it was not easy, and it’s not easy for anyone. Naturally, there were two camps created — Daniel Camp and Rob Camp — and sometimes they didn’t talk. Again, without our intention, it was a dynamic that didn’t work well. So to me, it was clear that I had to either take back the CEO role and drive the company, or next time I would step down completely. This is a pretty common problem with founders. Obviously, The Verge is much smaller than UiPath, but I only have a handful of co-founders left. I often tell people that they should be the editor-in-chief, and it’s perceived as a threat. They’re like, “No, we wouldn’t do it if you were here.” Did you have the power as the founder and the controlling stakeholder to say, “I’m just making this decision, I’m coming back?” Was there an approval process? This is one of those moments that seems like it comes up a bunch with founders. Theoretically, I had the power to do this, but in practical terms, it’s something very difficult to do. Look, we are a public company. It’s board governance. I have a seat on the board. The board should make the decision. So, the board would have to make a collective decision to fire Rob on my pressure. They could have mutinied against me, but it’s not so simple. It’s doable, but– That’s really the question. We see some of these decisions from the outside. The founder coming back as a CEO seems like a very natural course of events, but then it’s very complicated on the inside, particularly with founders who were the CEO, stepped aside for another CEO, and then came back. If there is a battle between the founder and the CEO, yes, things could be pretty ugly. In our case, it really was not. Rob really exited under the best conditions. He gave me all the time. He assisted me with the transition. He then took some time off to fix his personal stuff. From this perspective, it was a smooth transition. You mentioned the company had grown in ways you didn’t want it to. With a new CEO, there are cultural implications with how they would like to run the company. Then as the founder, you come back and want to change it back. You just reported financial results. Things seem to be a little more stable than they were in the past. What changes have you made, either to go in a forward direction or to go back to the way things were when you were CEO? I wanted to bring back some of our mojo of being customer-centric, working with customers, and doing whatever they required to be successful. We went back largely to “land and expand,” to being customer-centric while still preserving the muscle to do big deals. We need both. Forecasting is kind of difficult in a company that depends only on big deals. The lumpiness in revenue can create issues with forecasting. It’s normal to have both sides of the equation. That’s also a thing that I didn’t realize. We’re not a technology that you can go day one and say, “I will sell you a $100 million of automation.” Let’s see a smaller division and see how it works. Then, expand into other divisions, and then company-wide. So, regardless if you have a good Rolodex, you won’t go to another CEO and say, “Okay my friend, give me this big deal because I’m here for you, and I promise you we’ll do it best.” You need to prove it, and you need to earn your way into a company. That’s why, in our DNA, the essence is to stay extremely customer-centric, work with them, help them find opportunities, help them deliver the value, prove the value, and have them message internally about the benefits of automation. We kind of lost a bit of this muscle. And now, we’ve segmented differently. I created an executive accounting program where we have our top 50 diamond accounts with all our executives attached to those accounts, and we are taking it very seriously. We also have a co-innovation program where we build software together. We decentralized our customer success function that was centrally run. It was a bit disjointed from the sales motion, so we decentralized it into the region, and it’s much more aligned with the customer right now. We even changed the compensation of our sellers and customer success to be closer to the adoption of our software. Regional partners were also moved within the sales teams. I simplified and streamlined the international part of our business into one big region. There have really been a lot of changes. Were all those changes in your head while you were the chief innovation officer? You were watching the company change and the results, and you were thinking, “This is how I would fix it?” Or did you come to this plan after you retook the CEO role? I think some of the pain that we were experiencing was known at that point. The changes? Not really so much. It took me a month to understand who the people on my team would be and what kind of changes we were going to make. I love having people come back on the show because I get to read their old decision-making frameworks back to them. You left, you took a break, you got to think about who you wanted to be and how you wanted to spend your time. The last time you were on the show I asked, “How do you make decisions?” You said, “I’m trying to learn more by listening to people. I have no idea how to run a big company at this stage because I have never been in a similar situation before, but I’m trying to build a close-knit executive team that relies on each other.” Then, you said the thing people say, which is to “[make decisions] fast if they can be reversed, and do them slowly if they’re irreversible.” Is that still your framework? Have you come to a different approach? Are those still the basics? I think largely, yes. I like to give space to people to delegate. My style is to agree on goals, agree on the plans, and then let the people run. If I find issues, even small issues, my style is to dig around to see if there are signs of potential cancer or things that are completely not working. You discover interesting things. But yes, I think the faith of the company depends extremely on the cohesion of the leadership team. A big difference in how I make hiring decisions compared to 2022 is that I will never trade chemistry for talent. Bringing talent that doesn’t fit into an organization never works, and long term, it creates really big issues. I asked you about the structure of the company last time, and you had a really interesting answer. You didn’t talk about the structure at all. You talked about the culture and said you want the culture of the company to be “one single word.” The word you picked was “humility,” and you talked about that for a minute. It’s been two years since then. I’ve come to believe that the structure question is really a proxy for a culture question. By describing the structure of the company, you’re describing the culture. Would you still pick “humility” if I asked you to describe the culture of the company? I think at that time, humility was the most-needed aspect because we rode a very successful IPO, and our stock was very high. Many people made a lot of money. We lost a bit of humility at that point. Right now, we are back to our roots. I think the company has been through pain, and we understand better. Look, I am not smart enough to learn from successes, and UiPath is not smart enough to learn from successes, but I think we are smart enough to learn from pain and suffering. Humility was in the genesis of our company and it’s an integral part. What we need now more is to be bold and fast. We are making a big push into our agentic automation era, and I see great things happening. It’s a new energy. Also, we ran RPA (robotic process automation) for seven, eight years. There was a bit of fatigue at the end. We were just perfecting the software and getting into some white spaces, but it was not that exciting. Agentic AI brings a lot of excitement to the table. We pivoted in product and engineering overnight basically, more than half of the organization into building the new agentic products. All the teams are energized because they know. We basically put agentic automation as our number one priority as a company. We literally changed direction. It’s not the Titanic, but it’s a big boat. I think very few companies have a chance for an act two, and we have this chance. AI and automation are so synergetic. I think more and more people came to that conclusion. Agentic, in essence, is AI plus automation. It’s the fusion of AI and automation. We’re so well-positioned to deliver on this promise. So our product and engineering is going at a breakneck pace, making really bold decisions. From a technology standpoint, we’ve replatformed our workflow engine to a more modern technology. They really embodied being bold and fast. I cannot say yet that this is true for other parts of the company, and this is where I work with our leaders to be completely prepared for our act two. I’m going to ask one more question about structure, and then I have a lot of questions about agentic AI and automation. One of the big decisions you made when you took over the role as sole CEO once again is you cut about 400 people. You laid off 10 percent of the company. Did you end up restructuring around that cut? Why make that decision, and what was the goal? We looked into our central functions at that point. And in all fairness, we over-hired people in those central functions, and we had to streamline the organization. Decisions to fire people are the hardest from an emotional standpoint, from a cultural standpoint, and financially. It’s very hard to make them. Every time we had to do them, it’s been a thorough process. I was never rushing, and I was always fighting more on “do we really need to?” And it came at one of the lowest moments for us, along with the CEO changes. I think now, as we put it behind us, we are more prepared. The world is in an interesting, challenging phase right now. Nobody knows where it’s going to go. I think we as a company are a bit more prepared, more streamlined, and agile. We took time to heal the pain, and I think the confidence in the company is restoring. Looking back, I think that was the right thing to do for the company. I wanted to ask that question as the lead-in to AI. You’re describing making these cuts as a low moment, as something that was very difficult to do. The right decision, but very difficult to do. You pull the thread on AI, and what I hear from our audience is, “This automation is going to come for our companies and we will all be out of a job.” White-collar workers will be out of a job. Software engineers might be out of a job. Lawyers are terrified of being out of a job. Do you see that connection, that if your software is successful you will reorient the economy and a lot of people might lose their jobs? If we are realistic right now, it’s all a matter of the time of change, not the change itself. Your job and my job have changed over time. Jobs change. It’s a matter of when it’s going to be and how compressed the change is. Right now, I’m not so fearful that it’s going to come so suddenly. If you look at AI and the real use cases, we still have to see widespread adoption. It’s a productivity gain right now, more like an assistant type of AI. I ask something, I get that response, I do my job a bit faster and better. It’s not at the point yet to affect really huge volumes of the population. I think agentic AI is one of the steps toward deploying AI into more of an enterprise context, and it might accelerate the way jobs are transforming. What do I mean by this? I think a job today is not a simple task. There are very few people whose job you can describe as one single task. So a job is a multitude of operational things, repetitive things, and many ad hoc things. It depends on different environments and businesses. I think that many repetitive tasks have been solved. We have the technology to basically eliminate many of them from one’s job. Now we also have the technology to help people with more of these ad hoc tasks, like research tasks. I think the jobs will be moved more toward where people make decisions. They’ll analyze what information agents are retrieving and what they’re putting together. Agents plus automation. People will analyze, will make decisions, and then the actions will be carried on by enterprise workflows, robots that we already have. So jobs will transform more into decision-making, inspections, and overseeing from a command plane. I think about this all the time. I don’t know that I’m a great editor-in-chief. I feel like you could automate me by just walking into rooms and having a soundboard that says “make it shorter” or “make it longer,” and you just spin the wheel and pick one. But I know when to say those things because I spent years writing blog posts, then stories, and now podcasting. I have all this experience executing the decisions so that I have a high level of confidence in the decisions that I’m making when I make them. How do you get that if no one is executing the decisions? If that’s all robots? I just want to make a comparison to you. You were the founder, you spent all this time running this company. How would you make good decisions if you didn’t have all of that experience? The execution experience? Yeah. That’s a good question. Eventually, many things will be like a black box. I don’t know why if I press a key on my keyboard it displays on the screen, but I can make the decision to press. In a way, operations will be like a black box for many companies, and decisions will be at a higher level. I think we can still make decisions even if we don’t know how things are cooked behind the scenes. I’m curious how that plays out. I am of the school that says the best leaders are the ones who spent time on the ground. That’s not always true. I’ve talked to a lot of leaders on the show, but particularly when I talk to founders, that experience at every stage of the company is what informs the confidence to make changes. If operations are a black box, I wonder where that confidence comes from. I need to reflect more on that. Probably the best people will understand the operations as well. Even if they are carried out by robots and AI, they will understand in order to make better decisions and change the operations. But this is more of an analytical type of person. The types of jobs where there’s more mechanical typing, copying, and pasting are going to disappear. So the last time you were on the show, I don’t think there was a lot of hype around RPA. I was into it because I’m fascinated by the idea of computers using computers, and when you were on the show in 2022 was sort of the height of that. You were riding high. This is why you said you needed humility. The idea was that instead of upgrading a lot of old computer systems, we would abstract them away with UiPath technology, build new interfaces, and that would allow all kinds of flexibility. That was a big idea. I think that has changed. In the AI age, we see a lot of companies promising agentic capabilities. We see a lot of companies saying that they’ll move even farther up the stack, all the way up to decision-making. But when I look back on that conversation and everything that’s happened since, the thing that gets me is that robotic process automation, the idea that you have some old hospital building’s system and UiPath will build a modern way to use it, is deterministic. You knew where all the buttons in that software were, you could program your way through them. Maybe you needed some machine learning to understand the interfaces better or to make it less brittle, but you knew what the inputs and the outputs were. RPA knows the path between those things. AI is totally not deterministic. The robot’s going to go do something. Is there a connection between the software you were building, the RPA you are selling, and the agentic capabilities you want to build? Because it seems like there’s a fundamental technology shift that has to happen there. I think you expressed the essence of what we are building when you say deterministic and non-deterministic. These are exactly the terms I use when I am explaining how robots and AI should interact. Look, LLMs are not meant to do deterministic tasks. If you ask an LLM to multiply two numbers, it cannot figure out how to multiply two numbers because it’s not statistical matching. What it would do best is understand, “Ah, I’m required to multiply two numbers. I have a tool that knows how to multiply two numbers, so I will call a tool and I will get the precise answer.” This is how they work. They don’t have the intelligence inside them because it’s a non-deterministic tool. It’s not meant to do a series of deterministic steps. In the same way, you can think of transactional work that produces side effects in enterprise systems. It should be deterministic. You cannot have a 95 percent chance of succeeding a payment transaction. It has to be 100 percent, and if there is an exception, people should be notified. It cannot be “maybe.” Our robots offer this fully deterministic way to do transactions across multiple systems, transactions that create effects on these systems. With LLMs and with technology like OpenAI’s Operator or “computer use” from Anthropic — actually we are users, and we work closely with both of these companies to integrate their technology — you can complement what RPA is doing on parts of the process that you couldn’t automate before. If I have a process that relies on doing research… like if I’m traveling, I want to create a travel agent with AI. This travel agent will do research on available flights and across a multitude of airlines. It’s no big harm if I miss one flight option. So I can have a non-deterministic tool, go and extract the information, then an agent can make some decisions. It can present to the user, “These are available flights.” But then when I book a flight, I have to use something deterministic. When the money transacts, money changes hands. Basically we can have the best of both worlds. We can extend the reach of deterministic with non-deterministic while accepting the risks of non-deterministic. And there are domains like research or testing an application when we can take more risks. It makes sense. It depends on your level of risk you can accept. It makes sense to me. I see your competitors and your partners, like OpenAI and Anthropic, and they’ve made their entire technology bet on agentic AI. I assume that their plan is for that to get good enough to do everything. Your approach is that there’s some stuff that traditional RPA, the traditional deterministic computer, needs to do, and that can be layered with an LLM or an AI system. I’m just wondering what the intersection point is. Will there ever be an intersection point when OpenAI says, “Operator can do it all,” and that presents some kind of paradigm shift for your business? I am absolutely sure that the intersection point is when you can define a task in a deterministic way and know the steps. There is really no point in having an LLM that does this task all the time to rediscover how to do it or to think about every step because it’s impossible to get to 100 percent accuracy. We are testing these LLMs for simple form filling. They can work very well, but think about it. You need to run it hundreds, or even thousands of times to get to 100 percent accuracy. This is not what the technology is for. What I am saying is that LLMs will eventually create routines that can work 100 percent accurately. But the idea that LLMs will discover a process every time like you would when you see an application or a book for the first time in your life… humans don’t work like this. We learn. You learn an application, and then if you watch yourself, most of the things you’ll do will be on autopilot. We’ve had other companies come on the show and talk about their agentic software approaches. Actually, they were facsimiles of the agentic software they wanted to build. So, Rabbit came on the show, and its first version of the Rabbit R1 was running testing software in the background. You would ask for a song on Spotify, and it would just click around on the Spotify website in the cloud and then stream the song to you. Its claim was that it actually did build the agent, but it needed to build the first version and have proof of concept. But the deterministic system, in one very real way, can act like the thing people want from the AI system. It can almost do it and then it’s brittle, but the AI can make it less brittle by reacting to change or an unexpected outcome. How do you merge those things together? How do you decide which system to use? Because that seems like the technology problem of the moment. The way we are seeing the adoption of combined agentic AI and automation is by putting a workflow technology on top of it. Our agents are more like data-in, action-out agents — not necessarily conversational agents. We focus on delivering enterprise agents that work in the context of an enterprise process. So to us, the critical piece is this orchestration part. Let’s say you have a loan agent that has to approve some loans. A workflow is triggered when the loan application is received. So, you have an enterprise workflow. Then, that workflow will first send the application to a reading agent that is specialized in extracting the information from the application. Then, I can send it to a human user to verify something basic if I’m not confident enough in what I extracted. It can be a more junior person that does this verification. Then, the workflow will send it to an agent that will make loan recommendations. That agent can start to call tools like, “Get this person’s credit score.” So this tool is definitely something deterministic. It’s either an API to a credit score agency or you can use an RPA bot. That is clearly deterministic. You are not going to use something like OpenAI’s Operator to just figure out a guy’s credit score. There is absolutely no point. It’s taking too much time and it’s not reliable. Already you see it’s a combination. The workflow knows how to direct the fixed paths of a process, and then agents are capable of making recommendations and calling tools that will give the context. Then, after the agent makes a recommendation to approve this loan, it will go to a human user. The workflow will create a task, a human user will get it in their inbox asking them to approve or not. They press a button and approve. The workflow will go back maybe to the last agent and say, “Please compose a nice acceptance message particular to this client.” It’s a simplistic view, but this is how we believe the world and enterprise customers will adopt agents. Also, they need to have some confidence in the system. You said we are talking about this black box system, a swarm of agents that do their magic and sometimes they make mistakes. Until you accept it, you need to have confidence and you need to see the work. Everybody is more confident when they see the workflow. They can say, “Look, if that happens, it goes like this. If that happens, it goes like this.” So you can trace it, you can understand it, you can reason with it. One of my takes on the interaction between humans and AI is that for a long time we have to speak the same language. Even when you create an application or an automation, AI actually creates code. AI can eventually work directly with machine code. They don’t have to create Python code, but it’s important that AI creates Python code because humans can reason, change, and accept it. It’s going to be the same in automation applications. AI will use existing platforms, will create artifacts on top of those existing platforms, and people will validate what’s going on there. On the consumer side, the value of the existing platforms is, I think, under enormous threat. So I call this the “DoorDash problem” on the consumer side. We just had Amazon’s Panos Panay on, and it’s rolling out a new version of Alexa. You’re going to be able to say, “Alexa, buy me a sandwich,” and it will just get DoorDash to send you a sandwich. This is a huge problem for DoorDash. Its margins are under significant pressure if their interface gets commoditized in that way. We’re going to have the CEO of DoorDash on the show eventually and I’ll ask him this question. but I can abstractly see the pressure on some of these systems that are going to get commoditized by new kinds of interfaces. The classic RPA truly depended on those systems existing. You needed the existing loan system that nobody wanted to upgrade so you could build the RPA interface on top of it. You need the credit score interface that might not have a great API, but you can use RPA to go get it from their website. AI changes that because it’s coming to all of those systems as well. There’s some part of the AI industry that’s chasing all of those things at once, not just building this orchestration layer. What do you think about the long-term longevity of those systems? I look on the consumer side and I say, “Oh, this is a big problem for DoorDash. This is a big problem for Uber.” I don’t know exactly how it works on the enterprise side. We’ll see how it evolves. The fact that we still have a lot of mainframes, and our RPA touches a lot of mainframes, shows that the changing of enterprise systems is much more difficult than in the consumer space. If you look at complex enterprise applications like Workday and SAP, I can see people adding a nice layer of voice on top that’s AI-powered. You know, “Change my vacation responder to this.” But the tablet and mobile phone didn’t make the keyboard or mouse obsolete. I think they will still have to coexist. Many people can work on user interfaces faster with a keyboard than with voice, but voice is going to become a good way to interact with applications. When you need to absorb a lot of information simultaneously, you need the user interface. In many cases, you’ll still need to interact with it. It’s easier than telling the AI, “Please press the okay button.” I will just go and click the button. It’s easier and it’s faster. They have to coexist. I was thinking about the DoorDash problem. You’re basically saying that Amazon can build its own DoorDash. If it can control the interface with the client, it doesn’t matter who delivers in the end because– It’s not that they will build their own DoorDash. It’s that DoorDash’s opportunities to make additional revenue will go away. It won’t be able to upsell, won’t be able to do deals, won’t be able to have exclusives. The interface will be commoditized and it will just become a service provider with Amazon or whoever’s AI agent being in control of the business. You see that for a lot of these ideas. You need an ecosystem of service providers for the agent to go and address, and that crushes the margins of the service providers. It’s possible. I think I see it in the consumer space. You see the back and forth. There’s some amount of, “We don’t want you here. We’re going to block your agents from using our services.” That is already happening on the consumer side. There’s some amount of dealmaking. Then on the enterprise side, it seems like there’s going to be a lot of dealmaking where maybe instead of API access, we’re allowing agentic access or RPA access because the data is what’s valuable there. To a certain extent, we had the same problem with RPA. Think about the fact that most enterprise or SaaS software was licensed by user seats. With RPA, you needed far fewer user seats. You can have one seat that does the job of hundreds of seats. They found ways to kind of prevent this and create special service accounts to deal with it. Some vendors do not allow it. I’m sure they will find some ways to deal with it because how can Alexa order if DoorDash doesn’t want to receive the order? There has to be something in it for both of them. I think that’s an enormous technical challenge, and the business challenge is even harder. You have to get a lot of people to agree to fundamentally restructure their businesses in order for any of this to work. Again, on the enterprise side, there’s more dealmaking. You have some instincts, some history, some moves to say, “Okay, here’s how we’re going to structure access to the data.” I have no idea how it’ll play out on the consumer side. You mentioned a thing about LLMs not having memory, having to rethink the workflow every single time. That’s true. I think the AI companies are working on that. But they’re also pushing the idea of reasoning, that now we’re going to layer LLM approaches over and over again into a simulacrum of human reasoning. I don’t know if that’s correct. They say they can do it. Is that having an impact on what you’re doing? Can you say, “Here’s the decision, here’s the process by which a decision is made”? The way we are seeing the reasoning part is that it’s more helpful, in our world, for creating automations. We have this Copilot-type of technology where you describe a process and it can create the artifact to execute the process. The smarter an LLM is, the closer to reality the creation gets and the developer has to change it less. So in a way, it’s like creating code, if you want. It’s the same thing. The smarter LLMs will create better code, but that code is still going to be executed by hyperscalers. It’s not LLMs that do that. Think about it. Maybe LLMs will do everything. Why would they generate code at all? You mentioned hyperscalers. One of the things that I’ve been thinking about a lot is the amount of investment the hyperscalers are doing just to buy Nvidia chips, to build data centers, or to invest in nuclear fusion against the promise that there will be this much demand for AI services. They have to make money doing this somehow. It’s unclear how the bleeding edge, frontier AI companies are going to make money. I don’t know how OpenAI will ever make a dollar. I don’t know how Anthropic will ever make a dollar except by raising more money, which they’re very good at. That’s on a long-term plan. You’re a public company. You have to make the money. You have to buy the tokens, you have to use them, you have to build the products, you have to charge your market price. Are the rates we’re at now sustainable? I don’t know if it’s sustainable or not for them, but if I were them, I would do the same. What if this is indeed the biggest revolution of our time? What if all of these GPUs and AI agents will take over the world and I am not there? But I’m saying you’ve got to charge your customer some price for the use of an AI tool. You’re not running all of your own models. You’re partnered with some of these companies. You’re buying some of their capacity. They’re, in turn, buying capacity from Azure, AWS, or whatever they’re running on. All of these companies need a margin and some of their margins are negative. OpenAI loses money on inference right now, but it’s selling that capacity to you. At some point, they’re going to turn the knob and say, “We’ve got to make money.” They’re going to raise prices on you, and you’ll have to pass that cost to your actual customers who are actual businesses trying to automate their companies and raise their own margins. When will it become too expensive? That seems like the correction that’s coming. You’re going to say, “Okay, OpenAI raised our prices. UiPath has raised its prices,” and some customers are going to say no. If we look at through our lens of the processes we automate, what’s the alternative at this point? Using human labor? I think even if OpenAI increases prices, I still don’t think humans can compete with AI plus automation when it is possible. And long term, the pricing will go down and it’s a lot of competition for the business. I’m not really concerned about this aspect. Have you structured your technology so that you can swap between AI providers? Are you tied to OpenAI, Anthropic, or is that easily modular? No, not at all. We actually offer our customers a piece of technology that we call AI Trust Layer, where they can switch between different providers or bring their own on-prem model if they want. You just bought a company called Peak, which is another AI provider. Why make that bet? Why bring in technology? We want to get into vertical agents. Peak is a pricing and inventory agent, and it has really solid experience in delivering these dedicated solutions based on agentic AI, and we want to extend that. Of course, we’ll integrate it first into our platform, but we want to come out with more dedicated agents. It makes the entire go-to-market easier. We want it to work a bit like a locomotive for the entire platform because it can create more demand for automation. How does that technology plug into your existing stack? I understand it has markets you might not have or that you want to get bigger in, but ideally you buy a company and what you’re going to do is sell its existing markets more of your tools. Definitely. That was on our mind. I think we have really good synergies in our go-to-market, and we can really accelerate its go-to-market, particularly in the manufacturing industries. We have very solid manufacturing practices in the US, Germany, and Japan. Do you think there’s an opportunity for you to commoditize the AI tools themselves? I just keep thinking about this. You have your AI Trust Layer, you have your own vertical systems that you’re buying that you might deploy. At some point, what matters to companies is the business outcome, not that they have an OpenAI partnership. It feels like the big AI companies are trying to be everything to everyone, and you’re trying to specialize. Do you think at some point you’re going to say, “What we deliver are business outcomes and the technology doesn’t actually matter”? I think that generative AI is going through this phase. Initially, it was a nice toy. Everybody put budgets to experiment with it, and now we are moving toward the phase where people really want outcomes. Initially, they all used OpenAI, and our strategy was to use OpenAI because it’s the best. If you want to make a proof of concept, why would you use something different? But as you go and you specialize it for different types of industries and processes, you can choose whatever is more appropriate. We look at everything from DeepSeek, Llama, to Anthropic. We use all of them in different parts of the business. In the end, we are more of an AI engineering company, and our job is to build nice products that deliver value for customers. Behind the scenes, we use whatever LLMs are best for a particular scenario. I actually want to ask you about DeepSeek. Was that as shocking of a moment for you? The industry reacted to the idea that you could run the model much more cheaply very harshly — very harshly. Did you see that and say, “This will bring my cost down. This is also a revolution”? Selfishly, for UiPath, any open-source capable model is a great thing for us and for our customers. My belief is that these dedicated agents will require a combination of fine-tuning and really good prompts. So, if you can have a great model that you can fine-tune and combine with good prompts, that will provide the highest value and the cheapest price. We find you can actually distill it into a smaller model that works very well for a particular domain. Where do you see the biggest growth for traditional RPA, for AI, and for the hybrid of AI and RPA? RPA is an established industry right now that grows in the low double-digits. The demand that we are seeing right now for our agentic technology, I have never seen in the RPA world. It really opens all the doors. We get a seat at the table where we are not used to being from the automation perspective. People are really excited about this idea of agentic automation. They get it. The value proposition is kind of simple for us. I can go to my clients and tell them, “Guys, where did you deploy robots? How are people interacting with the robots today? Why are we not reducing the work of people, deploying agents, and creating an enterprise workflow that will connect agents with people and robots?” It’s a no-brainer proposition. It resonates, it’s simple, it creates a lot of excitement. I want to tell you about my favorite Slack room at Vox Media and get your reaction to it. We have a room called Finance Support, and in this room, people ask a Slack robot to do stuff: file invoices, give receipts, all this stuff. I look at this room once a week, and it cracks me up every time. I literally fall over and giggle every time because the people who are new to this room type full sentences: “Hi, I need help with this receipt. Can you itemize this thing? I’ve got a flight.” The people who are repeat users have discovered that they just need to scream nouns at a robot. So they just show up and they just say the word “expenses,” and all of this is in one stack. There are people who are very polite and then people who are just yelling nouns at a robot. You can see this secondary language of human-machine interaction developing: “I’m just going to say keywords to the robot because that’s all it needs from me.” I look at that and I say, “Oh, that’s a revolution.” First of all, it’s very funny. But this is a revolution in business. You’re going to have some people who are just saying keywords in Slack to get things done for their business to an agent that might just go off and do it, and then you have the people who are used to all of the niceties of business fluffing up their communication. At some point, you’re just going to have robots saying nouns to each other instead of using an API. In many ways, that’s what RPA was. You’re just using the human interface instead of an API. Do you see all of business changing around this as clearly as I do when I look at this Slack room? Yeah, and even for RPA, this is true. Many people are using RPA by creating a Slack channel that connects directly with a robot that does something. AI just extends the same idea. To me, it’s kind of fascinating how we communicate with bots. I discovered myself — well, maybe it’s just an impression — but if I say, “please,” I think that LLMs come back with better responses. [Laughs] Here’s something I also worry about. You’re the CEO. You get a lot of emails, you send a lot of emails. Do you ever worry about the loop where you’re responding to an email that was written by AI with another email that’s written by AI and suddenly everyone’s just pushing the summarize button and no one’s actually talking? I personally write my emails because everybody in the company and clients knows my own tone and my broken English. So I cannot use LLMs. But yes, I’ve seen many instances where it looks like LLMs are talking to each other. You’re the automation vendor. LLMs talking to each other — there’s something hollow there, right? Is that something you want to achieve with your products, or is it something you’re trying to avoid? I think to a certain extent we want to achieve that with our product. We want to facilitate agents talking to each other, but in a more controlled environment. Daniel, you’ve given us so much time. You’re going to have to come back. I feel like I could just talk about the philosophical repercussions of all of these systems with you for many more hours, but you’ve given us so much time.

Photo Credit: An image of the Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai PxHere The tourism category saw 45 individual foreign direct investment projects, making it the most active by project count among the top five sectors. Select a question above or ask something else Dubai attracted a record 1,117 foreign direct investment (FDI) for projects in 2024, maintaining its position as the top global destination for FDI for the fourth consecutive year, according to data from the Dubai FDI Monitor. Dubai attracted an estimated 52.3 billion Emirati Dirhams (approximately $14.2 billion) in FDI capital during 2024, a 33% increase from 39.26 billion Emirati Dirhams ($10.7 billion) in 2023. Hotels and tourism accounted for 14% of estimated foreign capital in 2024, equal to $2 billion, tied with real estate as the most heavily invested sector in Dubai. The tourism category saw 45 individual FDI projects, making it the most active by project count among the top five sectors. Real estate followed with 11 construction projects. In 2024, Dubai saw 18.7 million international visitors, up 9% from the previous year. For Dubai, India emerged as the top source of FDI capital for the first time, driven in part by real estate investments. The United States and Switzerland concentrated their capital in software, IT services, and tourism. In global terms, Dubai accounted for 6.2% of all FDI projects. Within the Middle East, it captured 55% of the region’s total. The data comes as Dubai pushes ahead with its D33 economic agenda, which includes a target of $177 billion in FDI over the next decade. The strategy focuses on positioning Dubai as one of the top three cities globally for both business and leisure — a goal that hinges in part on continued growth in tourism-related investment. Riyadh, which has been aggressively positioning itself as a regional investment hub, attracted 191 FDI projects in 2024. Despite high-profile efforts such as the creation of a dedicated FDI marketing ministry and the launch of a $5 billion investment partnership with BlackRock, Saudi Arabia’s capital is still far behind in converting global investor interest into actual project commitments. FDI is a hot topic in Saudi Arabia, especially regarding tourism projects. Multi-billion-dollar projects like Neom, Diriyah and Red Sea draw attention for the immense amount of public spending they have required. However, these projects are largely focused on the leisure market – religious tourism is the largest travel segment in Saudi by a wide margin. In January, Saudi opened up FDI into Makkah and Medina projects for the first time.

My wife even commented that my face looked ‘refreshed.’" 3. Jessica T., 27 – Miami, FL "I was tired of using expensive skincare products that never worked.

If you’ve been struggling with gut issues, skin problems, or both, this probiotic formula might be the breakthrough you need. How Does Prime Biome Work? The Science Behind Its Powerful Effects The secret behind Prime Biome’s success isn’t just about probiotics—it’s about the gut-skin axis and how a balanced microbiome plays a direct role in skin cell regeneration, digestion, and inflammation control. This supplement is formulated to target the underlying causes of digestive discomfort, poor nutrient absorption, and premature skin aging, rather than just masking symptoms like conventional probiotics or skincare products. By combining clinically-backed probiotic strains (Verified) with powerful botanicals, Prime Biome delivers a multi-faceted approach to gut and skin health, ensuring that your body isn’t just looking better but actually functioning optimally from the inside out. Here’s a deep dive into how this supplement works at a cellular level. 1. Rebuilding the Gut Microbiome for Lasting Balance At the heart of Prime Biome’s effectiveness is its ability to restore and maintain a thriving gut microbiome. Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, and when the balance is thrown off—due to diet, stress, medications, or environmental toxins—it leads to digestive distress, chronic inflammation, and even skin problems like acne, dullness, and premature aging. One of the key probiotic strains in Prime Biome, Bacillus Coagulans, has been clinically studied for its ability to survive stomach acid and reach the intestines alive. Unlike traditional probiotics, which often get destroyed by the harsh stomach environment, Bacillus Coagulans form protective spores, allowing them to colonize the gut and repopulate good bacteria effectively. Study Spotlight:A 2022 study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Microbiology found that Bacillus Coagulans supplementation led to a 48% reduction in bloating, a 39% improvement in digestion, and a 41% decrease in skin inflammation within eight weeks of use.>>Warning: Avoid Fake Sellers! Get the Authentic Product Only from the Official Website – 75% Off Here. By feeding the gut with beneficial bacteria, Prime Biome helps to:✔ Reduce bloating and indigestion by improving food breakdown and absorption.✔ Eliminate toxins that contribute to inflammation and skin irritation.✔ Balance gut bacteria, ensuring a stronger immune system and a healthier skin barrier. 2. Enhancing Skin Cell Turnover for a Youthful Glow The gut-skin connection is one of the most overlooked factors in skincare. Most people rely on topical creams and serums, but the truth is, healthy skin starts from within. Prime Biome’s formula is designed to accelerate skin cell renewal by supporting collagen production and reducing oxidative stress, leading to firmer, clearer, and more resilient skin. One of the standout ingredients is Babchi (Bakuchiol)—a plant-derived compound often called “Nature’s Retinol” for its ability to stimulate collagen, reduce hyperpigmentation, and smooth out fine lines. Unlike traditional retinol, Babchi doesn’t cause irritation, dryness, or sensitivity—making it a perfect ingredient for gentle but effective skin renewal. Study Spotlight:A 2023 clinical trial conducted by the American Dermatological Society found that Babchi extract increased skin elasticity by 36% and improved hydration levels by 47% after six weeks of consistent use. >>Big Savings Alert: Buy Direct & Save!

By stimulating collagen and cellular repair, Prime Biome helps:✔ Reduce fine lines and wrinkles by promoting faster cell turnover.✔ Even out skin tone by minimizing hyperpigmentation and redness.✔ Strengthen the skin barrier, protecting against environmental damage and premature aging. 3. Reducing Inflammation for Gut and Skin Harmony Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest contributors to digestive distress, acne breakouts, and premature aging. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it triggers systemic inflammation, leading to poor digestion, increased breakouts, and even conditions like rosacea and eczema. To combat this, Prime Biome includes Lemon Balm and Organic Ceylon Ginger, two powerhouse anti-inflammatory ingredients known for their ability to soothe gut irritation, reduce oxidative stress, and calm the nervous system. Study Spotlight:A 2024 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Inflammatory Diseases found that Lemon Balm extract reduced systemic inflammation markers by 42% in individuals with gut dysbiosis and inflammatory skin conditions. By targeting the root causes of inflammation, Prime Biome:✔ Soothes gut lining irritation, preventing bloating and acid reflux.✔ Reduces skin redness and sensitivity, calming acne and eczema flare-ups.✔ Lowers oxidative stress, protecting cells from damage that leads to premature aging. 4. Optimizing Nutrient Absorption for Full-Body Benefits Even if you’re eating a healthy diet, your body might not be absorbing the full spectrum of nutrients due to gut imbalances. A damaged gut lining reduces nutrient uptake, meaning your body isn’t getting the vitamins and minerals it needs for energy, skin repair, and overall wellness. This is why Prime Biome includes Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin—two prebiotic-rich ingredients that strengthen gut lining integrity and optimize nutrient absorption. These plant-based compounds feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, ensuring that they flourish and support better digestion, increased hydration, and a more resilient immune system. Study Spotlight:A 2025 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Sciences reported that participants supplementing with Inulin and Slippery Elm Bark showed a 58% increase in nutrient absorption and a 33% improvement in digestive efficiency. By improving nutrient bioavailability, Prime Biome helps to:✔ Enhance energy levels, reducing brain fog and chronic fatigue.✔ Boost skin hydration, making your complexion more radiant and plump.✔ Support immunity, giving your body the strength to fight off inflammation and toxins. >>MUST-SEE: Shocking New Report Reveals the Truth About Prime Biome – Does It Work?

Are There Any Prime Biome Complaints? What You Should Know With over 50,000+ verified users, Prime Biome has built a reputation as one of the most effective gut-skin health supplements available today. But like any highly popular product, it has attracted its share of misinformation, fake reviews, and misconceptions. 1. The Truth About Fake Prime Biome Products One of the biggest issues is counterfeit supplements being sold on unauthorized platforms like Amazon, eBay, and third-party sellers. These fake products look identical to Prime Biome but contain low-quality, ineffective ingredients, leading to negative experiences and false complaints. Many customers who unknowingly purchased fake versions have reported zero results, not realizing they were not taking the real, clinically-backed Prime Biome formula. >> Avoid Fakes!

As Prime Biome’s popularity exploded, some competitors have resorted to unethical tactics to discredit it. There have been reports of: The reality? Prime Biome is disrupting the market, and companies that sell overpriced, ineffective supplements are losing customers fast. 3. Customers Who Give Up Too Soon Some negative reviews come from users who expect instant results. Unlike stimulant-based products that give you a temporary high, Prime Biome works by rebuilding gut health gradually. For best results, users should take Prime Biome consistently for at least 4-6 weeks to allow full microbiome restoration, improved digestion, and visible skin improvements. 4. Is Prime Biome a Scam? Absolutely Not. Prime Biome is backed by verified scientific research, real user success stories, and a 60-day money-back guarantee. Every bottle is produced in FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring that customers receive only the highest-quality formula.

Side Effects, Medical Backing & FDA Compliance When it comes to health supplements, safety is the number one concern—and for good reason. People are tired of hidden additives, artificial fillers, and sketchy products that claim to be “natural” but lead to unexpected side effects. Prime Biome is different. It’s not just another probiotic—it’s a science-backed, doctor-formulated supplement designed for long-term safety and effectiveness. But with so many gut health products on the market, does Prime Biome Truly Stand Out as a safe, risk-free choice? That’s exactly what we’ll uncover here. Does Prime Biome Have Side Effects? Here’s the Truth The reality is that Prime Biome is extremely well-tolerated, with no serious reported side effects from real users. However, like any probiotic or gut-supporting supplement, there can be temporary adjustments as your microbiome rebalances. Some new users experience mild bloating or gas in the first few days, which is actually a sign that the probiotics are working. When beneficial bacteria begin repopulating the gut, they start to outcompete harmful bacteria, which can lead to a brief period of digestive adjustment. This is completely normal and should subside within a few days as your body adjusts to a healthier gut environment. Most users find that after a short period, their digestion becomes smoother than ever—with reduced bloating, better regularity, and improved overall comfort. Another important factor to consider is allergies. Prime Biome is free from common allergies like gluten, dairy, and soy, making it a safe choice for those with sensitivities. However, if you have specific plant allergies, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting. >> See Why Prime Biome Is Trusted By Thousands For Gut And Skin Health – Learn More. Prime Biome Ingredients – What’s Inside and Why It Works The carefully selected ingredients in Prime Biome make it one of the most powerful gut-skin health supplements available today. Each component is backed by scientific research, ensuring that every gummy delivers maximum benefits for digestion, microbiome balance, and skin renewal. Unlike other probiotic supplements that simply introduce bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by ensuring that those bacteria thrive, repairing the gut barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy skin cell turnover. Bacillus Coagulans is a unique spore-forming probiotic that survives the acidic environment of the stomach. Many probiotics die before they reach the intestines, but Bacillus Coagulans remains stable and activates exactly where it's needed. This probiotic supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves nutrient absorption, and strengthens the connection between gut and skin health. A 2025 clinical study found that people supplementing with Bacillus Coagulans saw a 49% improvement in digestion and a 35% reduction in skin irritation within eight weeks. Babchi is a rare botanical known for its skin-rejuvenating properties. Unlike harsh retinoids that cause irritation, Babchi provides natural collagen-boosting effects, helping to maintain skin elasticity. Its antioxidant-rich profile also neutralizes free radicals that contribute to premature aging, breakouts, and inflammation. Research suggests that regular use of Babchi may enhance skin firmness by 31% within three months. Dandelion is an underrated detoxifying herb that helps the liver and digestive system eliminate waste and excess toxins. Poor digestion often leads to toxic buildup in the bloodstream, which manifests as dull, acne-prone skin and bloating. Dandelion extract works by stimulating bile production, supporting digestion, and reducing gut inflammation, making it a critical component in restoring gut-skin harmony. Fennel is a potent digestive aid that helps reduce bloating, gas, and discomfort. It is particularly beneficial for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic digestive distress. By soothing the gut lining and promoting the movement of food through the intestines, fennel ensures a smooth digestive process, leading to clearer, healthier skin. Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that acts as fuel for probiotics, ensuring that the beneficial bacteria in Prime Biome can flourish. Without prebiotics, probiotics struggle to colonize the gut, reducing their effectiveness. Inulin helps stabilize blood sugar levels, improves digestion, and supports immune function, making it an essential component in long-term gut health. >>FLASH SALE: Secure Your 75% Discount Now – Limited Stock! Fenugreek is known for its ability to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut microbiome diversity. Unstable blood sugar levels often lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger acne and skin irritation. By keeping blood sugar steady, Fenugreek helps regulate oil production, reducing breakouts and promoting a clear, even complexion. A clinical trial published in 2024 found that Fenugreek supplementation led to a 41% reduction in inflammatory skin conditions and improved digestive function in participants. Lemon Balm is a powerful stress-reducing adaptogen that plays a critical role in supporting the gut-brain axis. Chronic stress is one of the leading causes of gut imbalances and skin issues, as elevated cortisol levels disrupt digestion and increase inflammation. Lemon Balm helps lower stress hormones, allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance naturally, leading to better digestion, reduced bloating, and a calmer, healthier complexion. Organic Ceylon Ginger is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory ingredients in Prime Biome. Unlike regular ginger, Ceylon Ginger contains higher concentrations of gingerol, which reduces gut inflammation, supports circulation, and improves digestion efficiency. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach skin cells, improving hydration and elasticity while reducing puffiness and dark spots. Organic Lion’s Mane is a rare medicinal mushroom that enhances cognitive function, gut health, and immune system strength. One of its lesser-known benefits is its ability to promote gut barrier integrity, reducing the risk of leaky gut syndrome. This, in turn, leads to clearer skin, reduced inflammation, and better overall wellness. A 2025 study found that individuals taking Lion’s Mane experienced a 38% improvement in gut microbiome diversity and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels. Slippery Elm Bark is a well-documented gut-healing botanical that soothes intestinal irritation, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. It forms a protective layer over the digestive lining, preventing toxins from leaking into the bloodstream, a common issue that contributes to chronic inflammation, acne, and dull skin. This natural protective effect makes it one of the most powerful gut-soothing ingredients in Prime Biome. Why the Combination of These Ingredients Makes Prime Biome So Effective The true power of Prime Biome lies in its formulation. Each ingredient was chosen to create a synergistic effect, meaning that the combination delivers results that are far more powerful than using any single ingredient alone. Many probiotic supplements fail because they lack prebiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and skin-supporting botanicals. Prime Biome’s formulation solves this by ensuring that every ingredient works together to target gut health, inflammation control, and skin regeneration simultaneously. The balance of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-supporting botanicals ensures a thriving microbiome, better digestion, and more radiant skin over time. The absence of stimulants, fillers, and synthetic ingredients makes Prime Biome a truly clean and effective formula for people struggling with bloating, digestive issues, and skin concerns.

Prime Biome is a complete transformation system, designed to revive digestion, restore microbiome balance, and enhance skin health from within. If you’ve been dealing with bloating, gut discomfort, unpredictable digestion, dull skin, or premature aging, ignoring Prime Biome might be the biggest mistake you didn’t know you were making. Most supplements promise short-term, surface-level benefits. Prime Biome, on the other hand, gets to the root cause of your problems—poor gut health, inflammation, and microbial imbalance—fixing them from within. When your microbiome is optimized, your digestion works effortlessly, your skin glows, your energy levels skyrocket, and your immune system becomes stronger than ever. 1. Revives Digestion and Eliminates Bloating Like Nothing Else Anyone who has suffered from bloating, indigestion, constipation, or food sensitivities knows how frustrating it is to feel like your gut is constantly working against you. The problem? Most digestion supplements fail because they only mask symptoms rather than addressing the root cause—a poorly functioning gut microbiome. Prime Biome is different. It restores balance from within, using a powerful blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing botanicals that optimize digestion long-term. This isn’t just another "gut health" product that gives you temporary relief. Prime Biome reshapes your digestion permanently, allowing you to enjoy food without discomfort, bloating, or unpredictability. >> See How Prime Biome Can Transform Your Digestion – Learn More. 2. Turns Back the Clock on Aging Skin—From the Inside Out Think your skincare routine is enough? Think again. Your gut controls how your skin ages. You can spend hundreds of dollars on creams, retinoids, and serums, but if your microbiome is imbalanced, your skin will continue aging prematurely. Prime Biome does what no topical skin care product can—rebuilds healthy skin at the cellular level. No other supplement combines these skin-enhancing benefits with deep gut healing. That’s why people who use Prime Biome report visibly younger, clearer, and more radiant skin within weeks. >> See how Prime Biome can revitalize your skin from within – Click here. 3. Balances Hormones and Boosts Metabolism If you’ve been struggling with unexplained weight gain, sluggish energy, or mood swings, your gut is likely out of balance. A poorly functioning gut leads to hormonal chaos, making it harder for your body to burn fat, control cravings, and sustain high energy levels. Prime Biome’s unique formula corrects this imbalance by: Most people assume that slowed metabolism is a normal part of aging, but the truth is your gut plays a far bigger role than you realize. Prime Biome ensures your hormones stay balanced, metabolism stays high, and fat-burning remains effortless. 4. Strengthens Immunity and Reduces Chronic Inflammation A weak immune system isn’t just about getting sick more often. Chronic inflammation—triggered by poor gut health—leads to: If your gut is inflamed, your entire body is suffering—even if you don’t realize it yet. Prime Biome’s potent probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants work to eliminate inflammation at its source, strengthening immunity on a cellular level. No single ingredient supplement can deliver this level of immune support. Prime Biome’s full-spectrum formula ensures your body stays resilient, energized, and free from chronic inflammation. The Scientific Testing Behind Prime Biome’s Ingredients Every single ingredient in Prime Biome has been carefully selected and clinically tested for safety and effectiveness. Unlike many “mystery blend” supplements that don’t disclose their full ingredient list, Prime Biome is completely transparent—so you know exactly what’s going into your body. Every batch of Prime Biome is lab-tested for purity and potency, ensuring each gummy contains the optimal amount of these clinically supported ingredients. >> Discover the scientifically backed formula of Prime Biome – Click here. How GMP Certification and FDA Compliance Ensure 100% Safety Prime Biome is manufactured in a state-of-the-art, FDA-inspected facility that follows strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). What does this mean for you? Absolute safety, quality, and consistency. Many supplements on the market cut corners during manufacturing, using cheap fillers, unverified ingredients, or low-quality processing. That’s never the case with Prime Biome. Every bottle undergoes rigorous third-party testing to confirm purity, potency, and safety. Here’s why this matters: These strict safety measures separate Prime Biome from other supplements that lack proper regulation. If a product is not made in a GMP-certified facility, you should be questioning its safety. Debunking the Myth: “Natural Ingredients Can Still Be Dangerous” There’s a common misconception that just because something is “natural,” it’s automatically safe. While some herbal supplements do have risks, Prime Biome was specifically formulated by medical professionals to be both effective AND safe. Here’s why Prime Biome’s formula is different from unregulated, “natural” supplements that could pose risks: The problem with many supplements is poor-quality sourcing—some companies use low-grade, contaminated, or improperly dosed ingredients, leading to potential safety concerns. Prime Biome avoids these issues by using only premium, carefully sourced botanicals and probiotics. Long-Term Use: Is Prime Biome Safe Over Months or Years? Unlike stimulant-based weight loss pills or harsh detox supplements that can cause issues with long-term use, Prime Biome is designed to be taken daily for lasting benefits. Gut health isn’t something you fix overnight—it’s a lifelong commitment. The longer you take Prime Biome, the stronger your microbiome becomes, leading to: Because Prime Biome is free from additives, artificial chemicals, and stimulants, there is zero risk of dependency, withdrawal, or long-term damage. Users who have taken it for months report sustained improvements in digestion, energy, and skin clarity—without any negative effects. Why No Serious Side Effect Complaints Exist It’s rare for a supplement to have thousands of satisfied customers and no widespread complaints—but Prime Biome is one of those rare products. Most “side effects” reported are mild, short-lived, and linked to the gut adjustment phase, which resolves itself within a few days. Unlike synthetic supplements that lead to jitteriness, dependency, or digestive distress, Prime Biome works with your body, not against it. Additionally, because Prime Biome is only sold through the official website, customers receive fresh, verified bottles that are properly stored and handled. This prevents issues that occur with fake supplements sold through third-party retailers. With a 60-day money-back guarantee, GMP certification, FDA compliance, and real scientific backing, Prime Biome sets the gold standard for probiotic safety. >>Don’t take risks with your health—choose the safest gut-skin supplement today. Why Prime Biome Works Better Than Traditional Probiotic Supplements The probiotic supplement market is flooded with products that promise to restore gut balance, but very few deliver real, measurable benefits. Most probiotics are either too weak, unstable, or incapable of surviving the harsh environment of the digestive tract. This is where Prime Biome sets itself apart. Unlike generic probiotic pills that contain a few bacterial strains with questionable survival rates, Prime Biome’s advanced gut-skin formulation ensures that beneficial bacteria reach the intestines and provide real, lasting results. Most probiotic supplements suffer from a low bioavailability problem—the bacteria they contain often fail to survive stomach acid and bile. This means that by the time they reach the intestines, where they are needed most, only a fraction of the probiotics remain active. Prime Biome’s unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and skin-supporting botanicals ensures that its beneficial bacteria are delivered in a stable, bioavailable form. Ingredients like B. Coagulans, a robust probiotic strain, form protective spores that allow them to withstand stomach acid, ensuring that they reach the gut intact. Another major flaw of traditional probiotics is that they often lack prebiotic fibers, which are essential for feeding and sustaining beneficial bacteria. Without these nutrients, probiotics can struggle to colonize the gut effectively. Prime Biome includes high-quality prebiotics such as Inulin and Fenugreek to nourish the good bacteria, allowing them to multiply and thrive. This powerful synergy between prebiotics and probiotics leads to better digestion, reduced bloating, and enhanced skin clarity. Additionally, Prime Biome doesn’t just stop at gut health—it directly supports skin regeneration and cellular renewal. Many probiotic supplements fail to consider the gut-skin axis, which plays a crucial role in overall health and appearance. By including herbal extracts like Babchi, Lemon Balm, and Organic Lion’s Mane, Prime Biome ensures that the gut microbiome remains balanced while also promoting a clearer, more youthful complexion. >> Want to see why Prime Biome is outperforming traditional probiotics?

How Prime Biome Supports Weight Loss Through Gut Health Optimization Many people struggle with stubborn weight gain, bloating, and digestive sluggishness without realizing that an imbalanced gut microbiome is one of the biggest hidden obstacles to fat loss. Prime Biome works by restoring gut health, which in turn optimizes metabolism, reduces inflammation, and enhances nutrient absorption—all of which play a direct role in weight management. Scientific research has shown that the composition of gut bacteria significantly affects how the body stores fat and regulates appetite. When harmful bacteria outnumber beneficial bacteria, it can lead to increased fat storage, insulin resistance, and an inability to efficiently break down and absorb nutrients. Prime Biome counteracts this by replenishing the gut with beneficial strains like B. Coagulans, which help break down food more efficiently and support a healthier metabolic rate. Inflammation is another major contributor to slow metabolism and stubborn fat retention. Chronic inflammation disrupts hormonal balance, increases cravings, and makes weight loss an uphill battle. The anti-inflammatory properties of Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm in Prime Biome help to soothe the digestive system, reduce bloating, and promote better metabolic function. By calming gut inflammation, these ingredients allow the body to burn fat more efficiently while keeping energy levels stable. Another overlooked factor in weight gain is poor digestion leading to bloating and water retention. Many people mistake digestive bloating for weight gain when, in reality, their gut is simply struggling to break down food properly. Prime Biome contains powerful digestive-supporting herbs like Slippery Elm Bark and Fennel, which improve gut motility, reduce water retention, and ensure that nutrients are absorbed efficiently rather than being stored as excess fat. The Little-Known Link Between Gut Health and Hormonal Balance While most people associate gut health with digestion, very few realize just how deeply the gut microbiome impacts hormonal balance. The microbiome plays a critical role in regulating cortisol (stress hormone), insulin (blood sugar regulation), and estrogen (reproductive health)—all of which influence metabolism, mood, and even skin clarity. Prime Biome’s carefully formulated blend of probiotics and herbal adaptogens directly supports hormonal balance, leading to improved metabolic function, reduced stress, and clearer skin. One of the most damaging effects of an imbalanced gut is elevated cortisol levels, which can lead to stress-induced weight gain, poor digestion, and breakouts. When stress hormones spike, they trigger inflammation throughout the body, including the gut and skin. Prime Biome helps regulate cortisol by including adaptogenic herbs like Lemon Balm and Organic Lion’s Mane, which promote relaxation, reduce stress-related inflammation, and support a stable gut environment. Insulin resistance is another major consequence of poor gut health, often leading to blood sugar spikes, cravings, and increased fat storage. Beneficial bacteria are responsible for breaking down dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help regulate insulin sensitivity and prevent glucose spikes. Prime Biome’s combination of prebiotics and probiotics ensures that the gut microbiome is functioning optimally, preventing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. For women, hormonal imbalances related to estrogen metabolism can significantly impact skin, weight, and mood. The gut plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating excess estrogen, and when the microbiome is disrupted, it can lead to estrogen dominance—causing bloating, acne, mood swings, and stubborn fat accumulation. By restoring microbial balance, Prime Biome helps the body regulate estrogen naturally, reducing these symptoms and promoting a healthier hormonal environment. What Makes Prime Biome’s Ingredients So Powerful? A Deep Dive Into the Science Unlike generic probiotic supplements that rely on a limited number of bacterial strains, Prime Biome is formulated with a comprehensive blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and botanical extracts—each chosen for its scientifically backed ability to promote gut and skin health. This multi-layered approach ensures that every ingredient works in synergy to optimize digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being. B. Coagulans, the probiotic powerhouse, is one of the most resilient bacterial strains, capable of surviving stomach acid and colonizing the gut effectively. Studies have shown that B. Coagulans reduces bloating, supports immune function, and enhances nutrient digestion. Unlike many probiotic strains that require refrigeration, B. Coagulans remains stable at room temperature, making it more effective in supplement form. Babchi, the plant-based collagen booster, is a powerful antioxidant known for promoting skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and supporting cellular regeneration. This ingredient enhances collagen production, which is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin. Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm play a dual role in reducing inflammation and supporting digestion. These ingredients improve gut motility, prevent bloating, and help break down food more efficiently, ensuring that the gut microbiome remains balanced and thriving. Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin act as natural prebiotics that fuel the growth of beneficial bacteria.

I smell opportunity....time to buy equities. Well, when the entire US government was run on tariffs, that was when we expanded the most. I guess Donald Trump is right. Fear drives the market. Both ways................... We’ll see how long the well-connected are willing to manipulate the markets downward. And sometimes those opposed to Trump will do things which hurt Trump and the USA…… The market was / is wildly overinflated. We were going to eventually hit depression levels of crashing given our unsustainable debt. This was the globalist plan. People don’t like this truth but Trump is right, we waited so long and allowed it to get so bad that the medicine we need is not going to be pleasant. What a bunch of whiners they are. Correct! Adam Smith has long been wrong. His writings are a fig leaf for greedy e ecutives in an age of mobike illefal immigrants and wage arbitrage for just the workers but not executives. Billionaires and Blackrock hardest hit. I’m interested if anyone has a number on how much investment is paid by loans? Part of the 1929 stock market crash (one year before Smoot-Hawley) was that many investors had taken loans to invest more, and more, and more. Classic FOMO. Margaret Thatcher’s proverb against socialism “...eventually you run out of other people’s money” applies to FOMO style investing as well. I smell opportunity... Exactly. I think much of Trump International’s investments are on loans, IIRC. I do believe much of the stock market is currently leveraged against itself / supported by borrowed money given how much money was thrown around the last several years. This is one of many reason why the actual rich and powerful are loosing their collectives minds. The consumer pays all taxes and the tariffs we are charged other countries are paid by whoever buys the finished product. Corporations collect the taxes from the consumer which is then passed on to the government. We’ve been supporting all the foreign governments this way. America has been running up a massive debt while supporting other countries and these other countries are in danger of financial collapse. Trump is moving to shore up the USA while helping Iran, Russia and China move toward collapse. Just my opinion, feel free to make it yours. Don’t be a Panican. The QQQ (Nasdaq 100) is currently right back where it was in August 2024. The only thing wiped out, so far, is the Trump election rally. The only thing wiped out, so far, is the Trump election rally. Trump has recently said that tariffs are “beautiful” and “wonderful”. That is all I need to know. Trump is never wrong.

Title: The IPO slump is bad news for everyone

Good morning. JPMorgan Chase released CEO Jamie Dimon's much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders. In the 58-page letter, Dimon said he sees stagflation dangers slowing the economy — and suggested that stock market pain may not be over. Dimon, a longtime meeting-hater, also offered tips on holding better ones. Read BI's takeaways here. In today's big story, public offerings were about to take off. Instead, they've hit the massive Trump Slump — and there's no end in sight. What's on deck Markets: Finance influencers share their advice amid Trump's tariffs. Tech: NYC's tech scene loves this cold-plunge and sauna studio. Business: Hollywood was hoping for a comeback in 2025. Now, those dreams are fading. But first, RIP to the IPO comeback. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's bad news for everyone. Just a few months ago, tech IPOs seemed primed for a comeback. "All signs were pointing to 2025 as the year when we would finally get some IPOs," said Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance Capital. But a historic stock market sell-off, precipitated by Donald Trump's tariffs, has thrown cold water on those hopes. IPO analysts at Renaissance now estimate that as few as 150 deals could be made this year, making 2025 the fourth straight down year for IPOs. Another possible factor: Dreams of an IPO comeback may have been unrealistic from the start. Recent boom times led to the belief that public markets could ask for the moon — and get it, BI's Dakin Campbell writes. However, as outlooks have softened, investors still expect high returns from IPOs, resulting in many companies struggling to generate the enthusiasm needed for a successful public offering. As long as IPOs remain stagnant, average Americans have few ways to share in Silicon Valley's wealth. A slowdown in the IPO market limits the opportunities for mom-and-pop investors to directly take stakes in high-growth companies. That means there's less chance for them to strike it big with the next Facebook or Airbnb. The knock-on effect? Further deepening the divide between the stock market haves and have-nots. "Yet again, we are sequestering the majority of the upside of our prosperity to the private markets that consist mostly of 0.1 percenters and institutional investors," Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur and marketing professor at New York University, observed. So, what could spur a more robust market for IPOs? Analysts have some ideas, though it will likely involve companies lowering their valuations. 1. Mark Cuban says the US could be on track for a "worse situation" than 2008. In a series of Bluesky posts, Cuban suggested the extensive tariffs, combined with cuts to the federal workforce, could result in a worse financial crisis than the Great Recession. 2. Finance influencers on navigating tariffs uncertainty. BI asked nine finance influencers their top piece of advice amid tariff-related market instability. They shared budgeting, investing, and travel tips, but the No. 1 rule was "don't panic." 3. The trade war's silver lining. The 30-year mortgage rate dropped to its lowest point since October during the trade war chaos of last week. That's a bright spot for homebuyers — but it may not last long. 1. Tariffs chaos hits Amazon's atmosphere. President Trump's whiplash tariffs announcement is throwing the retail giant into uncertain territory. Amazon's stock was among the hardest hit on Thursday, and some employees, sellers, and vendors say the company has given them little guidance so far. 2. Building AI is about to get even more expensive. Most semiconductors are tariff-exempt, but what if the chips are inside other products? It may be time to rethink supply chains. 3. NYC techies <3 sweating and networking. The cold-plunge and sauna studio Othership is the hottest new spot for New York's tech scene, mixing wellness with socializing. It's open to more than just tech workers, though it was designed with them in mind. BI went inside. 1. TikTok's US teams are getting Chinese leaders, staffers say. A string of US executive exits left a management vacuum at TikTok, which employees say ByteDance's Chinese leaders are filling. However, this could change again if ByteDance sells TikTok to a new owner. 2. Hollywood's dashed dreams. Three months into 2025, Hollywood's hopes for a comeback are fading fast. Trump's tariffs, declining production, and more are casting a shadow on the industry's growth prospects. 3. The Chinese food "tsunami." A slew of authentic Chinese restaurant brands are coming to the US, but geopolitical tensions and anti-Asian sentiment persist. Could the cuisine bridge divides between the two countries, or is it set up to fail? The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: Surveying The Landscape Of Institutional DeFi
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/07/surveying-the-landscape-of-institutional-defi/
Time Published: 2025-04-07T12:00:00Z

BySean Lee BySean Lee, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images A term that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, “Institutional DeFi” is widely predicted to be one of the defining themes of the digital asset sector in 2025 – and perhaps even the rest of the decade. If that seems far-fetched, just ask JPMorgan. The banking behemoth recently published a report subtitled “The Next Generation of Finance?” into the potential benefits of adopting decentralized financial protocols for the TradFi sector One point that stands out from the report is a relatively strict definition of institutional DeFi as “the application of DeFi protocols to tokenized real-world assets, combined with appropriate safeguards to ensure financial integrity, regulatory compliance, and customer protection,” going on to note an explicit exclusion – institutional players participating in “crypto DeFi.” According to this definition, JPM’s own tokenization efforts, based on its Kinexys Digital Assets platform, which is used to offer intra-day repo settlement, would be included. (It’s worth noting that tokenized repo settlements are projected to reach $1 trillion in the coming years, according to Citi.) However, any institutional activity in the established DeFi sector –including the $60 billion surge in DeFi activity recently observed by institutional custodian Fireblocks – would be excluded. On the one hand, crypto DeFi still operates in a regulatory no-man’s land, meaning many institutions will understandably be keen to distance themselves for compliance reasons. Various efforts have been underway to solidify regulator’s understanding of DeFi, and to recommend policy frameworks that can balance innovation and investor protection. Examples of such include IOSCO’s “Final Report with Policy Recommendations for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)”, and the Crypto Council for Innovation’s “Key Elements of an Effective DeFi Framework”, in which I was a contributor. So in time, regulatory clarity for DeFi will happen. Just not yet. With that said, crypto DeFi is the very place where the innovation happens as the barriers between institutions and crypto-native DeFi are increasingly hard to define as banks increasingly look to the benefits of public decentralized infrastructure to issue their tokenized assets. For instance, a given blockchain ecosystem such as Polygon or Aptos is currently being used in multiple ways. JPMorgan itself has experimented with permissioned iterations, while other firms such as Franklin Templeton and BlackRock are using the public architecture for issuing their tokenized money market funds. All alongside an established ecosystem of native crypto DeFi apps. For institutional DeFi and native DeFi to play together, safeguards will be a non-negotiable necessity for TradFi players. However, a key question is: How eager are the innovators in DeFi willing to go along with the idea of rules and regulations? A ruling in the eleventh hour of the Biden administration that would compel DeFi platforms to implement KYC checks was met with predictable howls of dismay from industry insiders, indicating that resistance is still strong in some quarters. Even if such a ruling is now obsolete under the new administration, it’s safeguards such as these that would potentially unlock institutional access to crypto DeFi. And according to the recent JPMorgan report, “the prize for innovators who hone [institutional DeFi] for use in the world’s trillion-dollar finance industry could be substantial.” A key argument espoused by the crypto and broader tech sector is that regulation stymies innovation. However, the reality is that the institutional DeFi opportunity is already stimulating innovation and industry development towards the kind of safeguards that institutions would demand. One of the often-discussed areas where DeFi falls short is in compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations. Thus, permissioned DeFi solutions were among the first to emerge, heavily supported by crypto-native institutional providers such as Ripple Custody and Fireblocks, among others. However, this is only part of the equation explaining why take-up has been slow. Data privacy is also a compliance requirement at odds with the public nature of blockchain transactions and the ease with which large transactions can be traced. The extension of zero-knowledge technologies into blockchain privacy, along with the development of innovations such as iExec’s decentralized confidential computing, which uses hardware-based trusted execution environments, could bridge the gap between public blockchains and institutional privacy standards. Another bridge is needed between institutional models for organization, governance, and conduct, and the decentralized finance segment, where governance is managed through token ownership, and often, there is no figurehead by design. However, at this point in its evolution, the crypto sector arguably has its own institutions in the form of exchanges like Crypto.com or the other giants that also have a foot in the decentralized segment via their associated blockchain projects, such as the Cronos chain. These established firms, which have often courted institutional clients themselves, will have an important role to play in bringing together institutions and DeFi from their respective sides of the divide. The benefits of institutional DeFi are becoming too great to ignore, but the institutions themselves are invariably cautious about excessive risk, meaning they are keen to keep crypto DeFi at arm’s length. However, as the source of the innovation, DeFi developers have an opportunity to share in the benefits of institutional DeFi, assuming they remain open to the kind of safeguards that will make it possible for TradFi to collaborate.

April 07, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.

A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Farewell, Fugazy!

Time Published: 2025-04-07T11:40:58Z
Full Content:
That ruckus you hear in the capital markets is the sickening howl of the Fugazy Economy meeting its extinction. Fugazy means fake, unreal, dishonest, misaligned to what societies need to thrive. Fugazy means mis-using the time-value of things that purport to be wealth to multiply fake wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. The pernicious effects of that system are visible all across the ruined landscape of our country, a nation of broken cities, failed towns, and a demoralized populace. Mr. Trump apparently aims to convert the expiring Fugazy economy into a production economy — yikes! — based on making things of value, and perhaps more importantly, of people at all social levels having meaningful roles in the making and moving of things. The Trump tariffs are the first big step in a process that is already generating a whole lot of friction, heat, and ferment. The aim of the tariffs is straightforward: the end of a trade regime that punishes and cripples American production. The response so far is heartening. Many other countries suddenly seek new trade arrangements with the USA, correctly sensing that Mr. Trump means bidness. (This ain’t no Mud Club. . . this ain’t no foolin’ around. . . .) It’s even possible that these readjustments will happen so swiftly that the tariff differentials will be a wash before summer, and everybody will be, at least, on a firm footing, knowing what the clear new rules say. This new disposition of things required forceful incentives to change entrenched, harmful practices. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Another angle on this process is the dynamic known as import-replacement. It means exactly what it sounds like: where you used to get stuff from other lands, you now make it here. It should be obvious that this can’t be accomplished overnight. But the question is: okay, when are you going to start? Part of the answer is: we can’t afford to put it off any longer. There’s an awful lot of stuff, from machine tools to pharmaceuticals to military equipment that we had better start making again — or else slide into collapse, perhaps even slavery to other powers. That process starts with deploying real capital — as opposed to Fugazy capital — to re-start businesses and industries. That will take money away from hedge funds and other rackets that exist to play games with evermore abstract layers of things that only pretend to represent money. As that occurs, a lot of pretend money will vanish. Don’t be too shocked by this. That’s what happens when a society bends back toward reality: you start sorting out the real money from the fake money. That’s why the price of gold keeps marching up. I sense that Mr. Trump and his colleagues knew full-well that the tariff play would rattle the markets badly, that these “corrections” are an unavoidable consequence, and are better gotten-over as quickly as possible. What else would you expect in a system that has dedicated itself for decades to mis-pricing the value of just about everything? The snap-back is sure to be harsh. The psychopathocracy that drives the Global Left lost more traction last week in its quest to keep all of its old rackets running. Their foot-soldiers in the USA have been defunded effectively by Mr. Musk’s DOGE, starting with the immense network of rackets that were run around the USAID program. The Woke NGOs are no more and the fat paychecks are no longer going out to the nose-ring-for-lunch-bunch who came to infest the DC Beltway — and their satellite offices in Democratic Party controlled cities. Hence, the feeble turn-outs in last weekend’s street actions. The Baby Boomers have gone especially psychotic. That’s why there are so many old folks waving those Soros-made placards in the astroturfed crowds of the “Hands-off” protests. After an eighty-year run of the most mind-blowing comfort and convenience enjoyed by any generation in world history, America’s Boomers stare into the abyss of their fading Fugazy fortunes as their stock portfolios tank. Kind of too bad. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone along for the ride. Maybe you should have cared for your country a bit more. Here’s your poster-boy for that: the retarded slob rock-and-roller Neil Young, performing in support of the US Intel blob, the Covid-19 vaccine campaign, the degenerate Democratic party, Senator Adam Schiff, and BlackRock. Neil Young’s estimated net worth is about $200-million. He could lose ninety percent of that and still live a life of luxury. In 2022, he inveighed against Covid vaccine “misinformation” and promoted the shots. Guess, what? You were dead wrong about that, Neil, and now a lot of people are dead and dying because of those vaccines. He has many compadres in showbiz who took the same position against reality. The time is not far-off when they will be revealed as disgraceful tools — Public vaxx champions such as Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Ryan Reynolds, Lady Gaga. . . the list is long and discouraging. Meanwhile, they’re all out there rallying the Woke troops against the Golden Golem of Greatness as the Left’s leaky lifeboat goes down, gurgle, gurgle. In the process, they’ve destroyed Hollywood, rock and roll, and comedy. The country will recover from that, too. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to laugh at them in the years to come as the obituaries roll in. Meanwhile, brace and rejoice! Great changes are set in motion. Roll with the turbulence. You’ll come out the other end, stronger, wiser, steadier, perhaps even happier. And, mark ye, the silence emanating from the DOJ and the FBI these budding spring days. The New York Times is nervous as all git-out. A much-appreciated note of optimism this Monday morning. Now, if we can just find a solution to the unlawful obstruction of executive prerogative by a subversive judiciary ….. One of your best ever, JK!👍👍 This post perfectly encapsulates where we are as a country today. Think about the private equity industry, which specializes in buying companies, layering on cheap debt and pretending that this creates value while producing nothing - Fugazy indeed! While I’m a Boomer, I recognize that we must right the ship, lest the country be lost for future generations. We’ve already saddled them with debt beyond belief. Time to stop the money printing presses and get back to being a producer nation. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Heads to Panama to Meet with Regional Leaders, U.S. Troops

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is heading to Panama City, Panama, on Monday, for a two-day visit to attend the 2025 Central American Security Conference and meet with American troops stationed there. “The Secretary will meet with partner-nation senior civilian, military, and security leadership in a series of bilateral meetings that will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations toward our shared vision for a peaceful and secure Western Hemisphere,” Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement. The annual conference will be co-hosted by the U.S. and Panama, and will focus on regional defense through joint operations and cybersecurity, according to U.S. Southern Command. At the same time, 50 U.S. Marines, in addition to sailors and soldiers, will train alongside Panamanian service members from the Panamanian National Aeronaval Service. As part of the training, the crews of four F-18 Hornets, one C-130 Hercules, one P-8 Poseidon, the USS Chosin and USS Normandy, and the Coast Guard Cutter Kimball will arrive in Panama, Southcom said in a release. According to the Marine Corps, Panamanian and U.S. Marines will train together on naval infantry skills, including marksmanship, land navigation, planning and orders development, and jungle warfare. Hegseth’s visit to Panama takes place as President Donald Trump has called on Panama to give the U.S. better terms on access to the Panama Canal, which the U.S. built in 1914 but agreed to hand over to Panama under President Jimmy Carter. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and is vital for American military and commercial shipping. Trump has raised concerns about the canal being controlled by China, which Panama has denied. On March 4, under Trump, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchinson Holding agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports in the canal to a consortium including BlackRock, Inc. — a deal that effectively put the ports under American control. As reported by the Associated Press, the deal gave the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including at both ends of the Panama Canal, as well as in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. During his Joint Address to Congress in March, Trump called for reclaiming the canal. He said in his remarks: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. Thirty-eight thousand workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die. The most expensive project, also, that was ever built in our country’s history, if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back. Even before his address, Trump talked about the U.S. getting ripped off by “exorbitant” transit fees. U.S. troops have long been stationed in Panama, to conduct training exercises and exchanges with Panamanian forces, including recent joint training exercises with the countries’ special operations forces.

Title: Global financial Ponzi scheme collapses in real time as markets plummet, Mike Adams and Steve Quayle warn of impending chaos

Global Financial Collapse: Analysts warn of a rapid unraveling of the financial system, with stock markets crashing, bond markets destabilizing, and hyperinflation looming, making gold and silver the only reliable stores of value. "The Great Taking": The crisis is framed as a deliberate dismantling of wealth, where institutional investors like BlackRock may seize assets from ordinary citizens, wiping out middle-class savings and pensions. Hyperinflation & Bank Bail-Ins: Government responses, including money printing and tariffs, will worsen hyperinflation. Bank "bail-ins" (confiscating depositor funds) and Chinaâs threat to call in U.S. debt could trigger a dollar collapse. Geopolitical Escalation: Trade wars with China could lead to economic warfare (e.g., dumping U.S. treasuries) or kinetic conflict, with Russiaâs hypersonic missiles posing a severe threat in a potential WWIII scenario. Urgent Preparation Needed: Physical gold, silver, food, water, and backup communications are critical for survival. Analysts warn of imminent societal breakdown, urging immediate action before supply chains collapse.

Urgent Preparation Needed: Physical gold, silver, food, water, and backup communications are critical for survival. Analysts warn of imminent societal breakdown, urging immediate action before supply chains collapse. In an emergency interview, financial analysts Steve Quayle and Mike Adams issued a dire warning: the global financial system is unraveling in real time. With the Dow Jones plummeting over 2,000 points and bond markets destabilizing stock markets, the two experts emphasized that gold and silver remain the only reliable stores of value as hyperinflation looms and governments prepare for "bail-ins" â the confiscation of depositor funds to prop up failing banks. The discussion, which aired on Brighteon.com, painted a grim picture of a coordinated economic takedown by global elites, with catastrophic consequences for middle-class investors. Quayle, a veteran financial analyst, warned: "The real story is behind the scenesâwhatâs happening in the bond markets. When bond markets take a hit, the collateral banks are holding collapses. Weâve never seen the economy deteriorate at such an accelerated rate with so many negative events happening concurrently." The Great Taking: Middle-Class Wealth Erased Adams and Quayle asserted that the current financial crisis is not accidental but a deliberate demolition of the existing system to usher in a "Great Taking"âa scenario where institutional investors like BlackRock swoop in to seize assets from ordinary citizens. "This feels like a great taking moment where the typical middle-class investor is about to get obliterated financially," Adams said. "Anyone not holding gold and silver will see their assets destroyed." Quayle added that commercial real estate is the next domino to fall, with major retailers and restaurants defaulting on loans, triggering a chain reaction that will wipe out pensions and savings. Hyperinflation, Bank Bail-Ins, and the Death of the Dollar Both experts warned that government responsesâsuch as Trumpâs proposed tariffs and potential money printingâwill only accelerate hyperinflation. "Whatever Trump or anyone does to respond to this will involve printing more money, which will only devalue the dollar further," Adams said. Quayle emphasized that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are already in crisis mode, with China threatening to call in its $2 trillion in U.S. debtâan act theyâve reportedly labeled as an "act of war" if unpaid. "If we canât pay the interest on our debt, China will consider it an act of war," Quayle warned. "The U.S. dollar is being repudiated globally, and 146 nations are moving away from it." World War III and Economic Warfare The conversation took an even darker turn as Adams and Quayle connected the financial collapse to escalating geopolitical tensions. They warned that Trumpâs aggressive tariff policies against China could push the world into kinetic warfare. "China and Trump are playing a game of global chicken," Adams said. "If trade wars go insane, China could sell off U.S. treasuries, ban rare earth exports, and even attack Taiwan." Quayle added that Russia and Iran have mutual defense agreements, meaning any U.S. strike on Iran could trigger a full-scale war with Russiaâone that would be decided in minutes due to Russiaâs hypersonic missile superiority. The Only Safe Havens: Gold, Silver, and Preparedness Both analysts stressed that physical gold and silver are the only assets that will retain value in the coming collapse. Quayle, who has decades of experience in precious metals, warned: "Without gold and silver, your entire financial worldâwhether youâre retiring or just trying to stay afloatâwill go down the drain." Adams urged listeners to secure food, water filtration, and backup communications (such as satellite phones from SAT123.com) before supply chains collapse entirely. Final Warning: âThis Weekend Could Change Everythingâ Quayle issued a chilling final warning: "This is the weekend that could literally go down in history. If youâre not prepared, you will be caught in the crossfire of financial destruction, war, and societal breakdown." As markets continue to freefall and global tensions reach a boiling point, Adams and Quayleâs message is clear: The collapse is here. Prepare nowâor face the consequences.

"If trade wars go insane, China could sell off U.S. treasuries, ban rare earth exports, and even attack Taiwan." Quayle added that Russia and Iran have mutual defense agreements, meaning any U.S. strike on Iran could trigger a full-scale war with Russiaâone that would be decided in minutes due to Russiaâs hypersonic missile superiority. The Only Safe Havens: Gold, Silver, and Preparedness Both analysts stressed that physical gold and silver are the only assets that will retain value in the coming collapse. Quayle, who has decades of experience in precious metals, warned: "Without gold and silver, your entire financial worldâwhether youâre retiring or just trying to stay afloatâwill go down the drain." Adams urged listeners to secure food, water filtration, and backup communications (such as satellite phones from SAT123.com) before supply chains collapse entirely. Final Warning: âThis Weekend Could Change Everythingâ Quayle issued a chilling final warning: "This is the weekend that could literally go down in history. If youâre not prepared, you will be caught in the crossfire of financial destruction, war, and societal breakdown." As markets continue to freefall and global tensions reach a boiling point, Adams and Quayleâs message is clear: The collapse is here. Prepare nowâor face the consequences.

"This feels like a great taking moment where the typical middle-class investor is about to get obliterated financially," Adams said. "Anyone not holding gold and silver will see their assets destroyed." Quayle added that commercial real estate is the next domino to fall, with major retailers and restaurants defaulting on loans, triggering a chain reaction that will wipe out pensions and savings. Hyperinflation, Bank Bail-Ins, and the Death of the Dollar Both experts warned that government responsesâsuch as Trumpâs proposed tariffs and potential money printingâwill only accelerate hyperinflation. "Whatever Trump or anyone does to respond to this will involve printing more money, which will only devalue the dollar further," Adams said. Quayle emphasized that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are already in crisis mode, with China threatening to call in its $2 trillion in U.S. debtâan act theyâve reportedly labeled as an "act of war" if unpaid. "If we canât pay the interest on our debt, China will consider it an act of war," Quayle warned. "The U.S. dollar is being repudiated globally, and 146 nations are moving away from it."

"The U.S. dollar is being repudiated globally, and 146 nations are moving away from it." World War III and Economic Warfare The conversation took an even darker turn as Adams and Quayle connected the financial collapse to escalating geopolitical tensions. They warned that Trumpâs aggressive tariff policies against China could push the world into kinetic warfare. "China and Trump are playing a game of global chicken," Adams said. "If trade wars go insane, China could sell off U.S. treasuries, ban rare earth exports, and even attack Taiwan." Quayle added that Russia and Iran have mutual defense agreements, meaning any U.S. strike on Iran could trigger a full-scale war with Russiaâone that would be decided in minutes due to Russiaâs hypersonic missile superiority.

Quayle, who has decades of experience in precious metals, warned: "Without gold and silver, your entire financial worldâwhether youâre retiring or just trying to stay afloatâwill go down the drain." Adams urged listeners to secure food, water filtration, and backup communications (such as satellite phones from SAT123.com) before supply chains collapse entirely.

Title: Jefferies tells tech giants that tariffs are a 'free hall pass' to reset their goals

Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies. In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a "free hall pass" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures. "Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance," said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill. The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days. The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health. Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days. The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets. Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider. For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, "likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks," the analysts wrote. The Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties. Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10. The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. At market close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 6%, the Dow was down 5.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week. On Monday, Asia stocks opened deep in the red. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning. "Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday. "The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion." Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Thousands of speeding prosecutions on hold pending test case over ‘defective’ notice

Full Content:
A test case with implications for more than 2,000 drivers who were allegedly speeding in an average speed zone will be heard by the High Court this week. The case concerns the legal adequacy of a fixed charge notice (FCN) issued to Edel O’Brien, Springhill Avenue, Deansgrange, Blackrock, Co Dublin, who is alleged to have driven at 131km/h on the M7 motorway at Birdhill (west), in an average speeding zone where a 120km/h limit applies. A core issue is whether the absence of the word “average” from FCNs, when issued for alleged speeding in an average speed zone, makes them so defective that a conviction cannot be registered on foot of them. About 900 other cases have been adjourned, and 1,500 summonses for alleged speeding in an average speed zone have yet to issue, pending the outcome of the High Court’s decision on legal issues referred by District Court Judge Miriam Walsh arising from Ms O’Brien’s case. Average speed cameras record vehicles at two distinct points a set distance apart, allowing for speed to be calculated over a longer distance than a single static camera. In Ms O’Brien’s case, she was served with a FCN alleging she was driving at 131km/h on the M7 Ballinahinch, (westbound) Birdhill, on September 7th 2022. Ms O’Brien contacted the Garda Processing Office querying the content of the FCN. She said she was then told, for the first time, the allegation related to a recorded average speed over a 9km distance on the M7 westbound ending at Birdhill. When she did not pay the notice, she was summonsed to appear before Nenagh District Court in March 2024. In setting out legal issues to be determined by the High Court, Judge Walsh said Ms O’Brien, representing herself, had pleaded guilty and accepted she had been speeding in excess of the 120km/h limit but she raised an issue that the FCN did not refer to the word “average” with reference to the speed of 131km/h alleged. Ms O’Brien argued the FCN materially misstated the particulars of the actual speeding allegation. The judge initially entered, but later vacated, a conviction against Ms O’Brien and suggested she get legal advice. The High Court will be asked to decide on issues in the case on Thursday.

Key Points Why Google’s and Meta’s Stocks Are Down Market Reaction to TariffsRecent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, effective as of early April 2025, have led to significant market volatility. These tariffs, including a 10% blanket tariff on all imports and higher rates for specific countries like China (34%), have raised concerns about increased costs for companies with global supply chains. For Google, this means higher expenses for imported components used in hardware like Pixel phones and Chromebooks, potentially squeezing profit margins. For Meta, similar cost increases affect its hardware division, such as Oculus VR headsets. Impact on Advertising RevenueBoth Google and Meta rely heavily on advertising revenue, which could be indirectly hit by tariffs. Higher prices for imported goods may reduce consumer spending, leading to lower ad budgets from businesses, especially international advertisers. For Meta, it’s noted that 10% of its 2023 revenue came from Chinese companies advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which could be at risk if tariffs raise costs for these advertisers Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta. Global Operations and Economic UncertaintyBoth companies have significant international operations, and the tariff-induced economic uncertainty could disrupt global trade, affecting their revenue streams. This broader market unease, as seen in the sharp declines in major indexes like the Nasdaq (down 5.97% on April 3, 2025), has contributed to the stock drops Stocks ravaged by tariff fallout as global supply chains brace for impact.

Title: A Tesla Uber-Bull Analyst Cuts His Price Target For The Stock By ~50 Percent, While Declaring That “Darker Days Are Ahead”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Tesla shares are now down around 40 percent so far this year, hammered by a fierce competition wave out of China and politically motivated boycotts in the US and the EU. Now, a Tesla uber-bull analyst seems to have read the proverbial writing on the wall by slashing his erstwhile sky-high stock price target by nearly half. $TSLA: Wedbush cuts target price to $315 from $550 "We remain bullish on Tesla, but this is a critical moment for Musk. The brand is weakening as a political symbol, and the situation is unsustainable. Musk has overcome major challenges before — this may be his toughest yet." — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) April 6, 2025 To wit, Wedbush's Dan Ives has now slashed his price target for Tesla shares by 42.7 percent from $550 to $315, while retaining an overall 'Outperform' rating on the stock. Even though Ives asserts that his "long-standing bull view of Tesla remains," he adds a qualifier by conceding that "this is a pivotal moment of truth for Musk to turn things around...or darker days are ahead." Ives goes on to note: "We have been one of the biggest supporters of Musk and Tesla over the last decade....but this situation is not sustainable and the brand of Tesla is suffering by the day as a political symbol." In what constitutes a sooting salve for the frayed nerves of Tesla investors, the Wedbush analyst notes that "Musk has been with his back against the wall many times and every time Tesla came out of it and was stronger on the other side...this may be one of his biggest challenges yet to turn around." As mentioned earlier, Tesla sales have struggled lately in the face of stiff competition out of China and politically motivated boycotts in the EU and the US. Elon Musk recently alienated a large segment of the German population by vigorously supporting the far-right AfD party in recent elections. Meanwhile, in the US, Musk's DOGE-related activities continue to drive a political wedge into Tesla's brand image. And, now we have solid numbers to back assertions of ongoing brand damage. As we reported last week, Tesla's deliveries cratered to multi-year lows in the first quarter of 2025, with the EV giant managing to record sales of just 336,681 units in the recently-concluded quarter against expectations of 377,600 units (IR-compiled consensus estimate). What's more, Tesla's inventory level soared from 77,330 units at the end of Q4 2024 to 103,264 units at the end of Q1 2025, despite a retooling-driven extended halt across the EV giant's production lines ahead of the launch of the Model Y Juniper. While some analysts, including Future Fund's Gary Black, continue to expect a gradual reset in the prevailing narrative around Tesla as the upcoming launch of unsupervised FSD in Austin draws near, we have yet to see any material evidence of such a paradigm shift.

Title: $2B Lost In 90 Days: How Losses In Crypto Security Incidents In Q1 2025 Increased 96% Y/Y

The cryptocurrency industry is no stranger to hacks and scams, but Q1 was particularly rough, and that might be putting it mildly. $2 billion. That’s how much was lost in crypto security incidents in Q1, according to a Tuesday security report from Web3 security outfit Hacken. For context, the figure represents a 96% increase over what the industry lost in Q1 2024 and is almost equivalent to the $2.25 billion lost in the whole of 2024. Don't Miss: Of the $2 billion lost in Q1, over $1.6 billion was lost to so-called access control exploits, over $300 million was lost to rug pulls, over $96 million was lost to phishing scams, and over $29 million was lost to smart contract vulnerabilities. The dominance of access control exploits is significant as a variation of it has led to the largest exploits for three consecutive quarters. Access control exploits see bad actors target the infrastructure surrounding a project, like its website front-end, to gain access and steal user funds. In the past three quarters, it has proved particularly effective in targeting Safe multi-sig crypto wallets, which are thought to provide additional security by eliminating a single point of failure. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. As highlighted by Hacken, access control exploits targeting Safe multi-sigs were behind the $235 million WazirX exploit in Q3 2024, the $55 million Radiant Capital exploit in Q4 2024, and the infamous $1.5 billion Bybit hack in Q1, the largest in the quarter by far and the largest exploit in history. According to Hacken, the trend highlighted a failure to secure the surrounding infrastructure around these multi-sigs as much as the smart contracts behind the wallet. Security practices suggested by the firm included implementing human-readable signing to allow signers to see clearly the details of the transaction they are consenting to, securing off-chain components like web interfaces, and promoting operational discipline among signers. Meanwhile, in addition to this access control exploit concern, Hacken highlighted that bad actors displayed new money laundering tricks in Q1. Trending: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Typically, when funds are stolen in the cryptocurrency space, they are funneled through mixers to obscure their origins, but bad actors may now be turning to a very different venue: trading platforms. In this approach, bad actors open large leveraged bets with their loot while hedging against that bet elsewhere with clean capital. They then let the leveraged position get liquidated while retaining the profits from the hedged position. “By sacrificing the origin wallet and creating a loss event on-chain, the attacker distances themselves from the stolen capital while retaining its economic value,” the report wrote. See Also: Have $200K saved? Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth Another approach these malicious actors are exploring is staging sandwich attacks to reframe stolen funds as profits from DeFi arbitrage. Still, behind Q1’s alarming hack numbers and the growing sophistication in how bad actors launder their loot, the cryptocurrency industry was able to largely maintain one positive trend. Specifically, the industry did not see a significant rise in decentralized finance exploits in line with a steady decline in the previous four quarters. According to Hacken, this suggested that protocol design is maturing. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Title: Trump tariffs: Australian sharemarket to plunge after Wall Street meltdown

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged the prospect of up to four cuts in interest rates this year as a result of the deepening global economic turmoil that wiped almost $100 billion off Australia’s sharemarket on Monday. Fears that US President Donald Trump’s trade war will trigger a US recession sent global markets into a meltdown on Monday, with the ASX 200 plunging 4.2 per cent, its biggest fall since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. The Australian dollar plunged to five-year lows of less than US60¢. Repercussions from US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements spread across global markets.Credit: Bloomberg The violent moves are due to worries that Trump’s trade war will inflict a major hit on world economic activity and spark a US recession, after China retaliated to the US trade barriers and as Europe prepares to take countermeasures. The ASX 200 has now fallen more than 10 per cent since the start of this year, and the bourse has lost about $175 billion since late last week, when Trump spooked the markets with his “Liberation Day” tariff plans. The typical superannuation fund has lost about 4.5 per cent this month, SuperRatings said, and there are growing financial market bets the Reserve Bank will respond to the global turmoil by cutting interest rates next month. As experts warned of more volatility ahead, Chalmers said the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the Australian economy should be “manageable” but noted markets were now expecting about four rate cuts this year, including one cut of as much as 0.5 percentage points at the next Reserve Bank meeting, on May 20. “I don’t predict or pre-empt those decisions, but the market is certainly now expecting multiple interest rate cuts over the course of the year, beginning in May,” Chalmers said in a press conference in Sydney. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor insisted the Coalition had a better track record on the economy, and that it was ready to manage the economy through the turmoil. “The impact of tariffs on global sharemarkets is impacting Australians’ retirement savings, it is impacting young Australians investing to save for a home deposit,” Taylor said. The market rout came as new Treasury analysis found the tariffs announced by Trump last week would permanently dent economic growth, but the bigger impact would be on the world economy. Australia’s gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, will be 0.1 per cent lower than if tariffs had not been imposed, while inflation will be 0.2 percentage points higher, Treasury said. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the Australian economy should be “manageable”.Credit: Dominic Lorrimer The federal Treasury’s analysis was based on an economic model created by leading Australian economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin. McKibbin said the model revealed the biggest hits by Trump’s tariffs would be on the Australian mining, energy, durable manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Demand for workers across mining by the end of next year could be almost 5 per cent lower than if the tariffs had not been put in place. Independent economist Saul Eslake said the impact on the Australian economy was likely to be worse than the Treasury forecast because the formal advice could not take into account the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s next decisions – and what he called the “madness” of the White House. “When businesses are uncertain, they put the shutters up – and they put off decisions to invest or employ,” he said. It was a sea of red on the ASX, with all sectors down sharply and shares in Australia’s biggest companies hit hard: Commonwealth Bank shares crashed 6.2 per cent and mining giant BHP plunged 6.1 per cent. Monday’s 4.2 per cent drop erased about $97 billion in value from the ASX 200. Perpetual’s head of investment strategy, Matt Sherwood, predicted more volatility ahead, saying there was no obvious “off ramp” for investors. He said it was hard for Trump to back down from the tariffs he had announced, and he believed it was also unlikely the US Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon. “The investors are not wanting to catch the falling knife,” Sherwood said. “It’s hard to see things stabilising, at least in the near term.” Despite the pain, Allekian Family Office managing director Shant Allekian was relatively unfazed by the recent market downturn, saying he views it as an opportunity to buy stocks at low valuations. “This is opportunity first and foremost, and these types of opportunities only present themselves every handful of years. I bought a lot of things on market open today,” he said. “Sure, it can be shocking to see these big headline market drops, but it’s important to put things into perspective and understand that longer-term things will revert to the mean, just like we saw during COVID and the GFC [global financial crisis].” He said anyone with investments or superannuation who might be panicking after today’s downturn should think about why they’re investing, and unless they have a fixed time frame, just ride it out. “This is where a lot of people can panic and get very nervous and think the whole world is falling apart. But we get these episodes regularly. This isn’t rare, and throughout all of these periods of volatility, the markets come through the other side at some point,” he said. Shant Allekian sees the market rout as a buying opportunity.Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said that while he did not think Australia was at risk of recession – which is generally defined as two quarters in a row of negative economic growth – he estimated the US faced a 45 per cent chance of recession, and this was the key concern for markets. “History tells us that if you have a recession in the US, then you could have a deeper, longer bear market in shares. If you avoid recession, it could be a shorter bear market or just a correction,” Oliver said. Wall Street’s S&P 500 plunged 6 per cent on Friday in New York after China announced its response to Trump’s reciprocal tariffs of 34 per cent on Chinese imports. But another reason for the wild swings on markets is investor uncertainty over whether Trump will implement all the tariffs he announced last week, or whether he could back down in the face of the sharemarket plunge. Montgomery Investment Management chairman Roger Montgomery said it was difficult to see a rebound from the plunge while investors remained uncertain about whether Trump’s tariffs were set in stone or more of a negotiating tactic. “While there’s uncertainty about that, it’s very difficult to imagine any investors building a case that says it’s safe to go back in now,” he said. The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself because it can drive a vicious cycle of behaviour that only worsens inflation. US households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. With Shane Wright, David Crowe and AP The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

WELCOME TO HOW I Spend My Money, a series on The Journal that looks at how people in Ireland really handle their finances. We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, what they save if anything, and what they’re spending their money on over the course of one week. Are you a spender, a saver or a splurger? We’re looking for readers who will keep a money diary for a week. If you’re interested send a mail to money@thejournal.ie. We would love to hear from you. Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes, so let’s be kind. Last time around, we heard from a lab specialist on €70K living in Dublin. This week, an audit associate on €31K living in Dublin. I graduated from UCC last year and I’m currently in my first year of a graduate programme at a ‘Big Four’ accountancy firm in audit. I’m 24 and living in a house share in the south Dublin area, sharing with four others. I went travelling last year around Asia for a few months as I knew what I was signing myself up for. On normal weeks, I work 37-40 hours per week, however, for anyone familiar with accountancy and audit, they’ll know the horror stories of the busy season. From January to March, I work anywhere from 55 to 80 hours, which are unfortunately unpaid. As if that’s not enough, as part of my contract, I must complete the ACA exams (the Chartered Accountant qualification) which take three years. Lectures and tutorials take up to seven hours per week and then I must study. My first round of exams are in May. Luckily, my studies and exams are paid for by my employer and each round of exams passed we get a bonus and marginal salary increase (around €2,000 increase if I pass these first exams). I have April and May off work as I will be on paid study leave before the exams. I save on the Revolut app, earning 2.5% AER (which typically earns me €10 per month after deducting Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)). Occupation: Audit associate (graduate programme) Age: 24 Location: Dublin Salary: €31,500, with an additional €900 gross for passing exams in May Monthly pay (net): €2,369 Extra income: €90-120 per month for walking my neighbour’s dog. €10-11 per month interest income after deducting DIRT from my Revolut savings (earning 2.5% AER) Rent: €850 (bills included) Groceries: My parents kindly give me a €150 Dunnes voucher every month Petrol: €65 – €75 – I’m not from Dublin and I travel home once a month to see family and friends. Unfortunately, due to my busy schedule, that’s all I can do as I don’t get any study done at home. Whilst in Dublin, I use public transport the vast majority of times, or walk Leap card: €20 Social: €50 Gym membership: €129 Car insurance and AA breakdown assistance: €56 Google and Apple storage: €5 Revolut Metal: €16 Spotify: €12 Vodafone: €20 HP ink: €3 Advertisement Coffee: €45 Long-term prescription: €40 Nails: €45-60 Health insurance: My employer pays half, and I pay €65 per month Savings: Typically €780-€950 per month Car tax: €76 every three months Hair: €230 every four months New running shoes: €170-€220 every four months Clothes: Approx €200 every three months – I don’t buy from Penneys, I prefer to get better quality pieces either new (if I want to treat myself) or I use vinted where I often find brand new items for less than half the price. *** 5:30 am: I wake up and prepare for the gym and work. I drink half of my protein shake to energise myself. My lunch for work is prepped. I tiptoe around the house to avoid waking my housemates. 6:00 am: I walk to the gym for my 6:30 am class. Although my gym is expensive, I certainly get my money’s worth as it is all class-based, and the facilities are top-notch, including Dyson hairdryers, hair straighteners, quality shampoo and conditioner, and excellent instructors. 7:45 am: I freshen up after my class, put on my skirt and blazer, and straighten my hair. My gym is near the green line Luas, so I top up my Leap card on the way (€5). 8:25 am: I arrive at work and grab a barista coffee (free) in the canteen. As I sip my morning coffee, the looming audit deadline begins to weigh on my mind, I certainly start to feel stressed and like an imposter! 1:00 pm: I enjoy my chicken salad sandwich and yoghurt during my break. Afterward, my friends and I take a refreshing 20 min walk around Grand Canal Dock before returning to the office at 2pm. 5:30 pm: After finishing work, I opt for a leisurely walk to St Stephen’s Green before catching the Luas home. 7:30 pm: I arrive home and make a vegetable stir fry for dinner. Before I know it, it’s 9:30pm thanks to doomscrolling on TikTok, and I reluctantly pack my bag for work tomorrow. 10:00 pm: I head to bed. Today’s total: €5.00 5:00 am: My alarm goes off a bit earlier today as I plan to go for a run before work. Having recently recovered from a stress fracture injury, I am gradually easing back into my running routine. I fuel up with a slice of toast and a glass of water. With a reluctant yawn, I put on my shorts and running shoes and head out for a 10 km run. 6:30 am: I get home, take a shower, and get ready for work. 8:30 am: After taking the Luas, I arrive at work and enjoy a complimentary coffee and pastry. My day is filled with a busy schedule, juggling endless work tasks while also preparing for my upcoming ACA exams. 1.00 pm: I glance at my watch, which signals it’s time for a much-needed break. I enjoy a prepped pesto pasta and crackers with hummus. It’s a sunny day in Dublin, which helps freshen my mind. My colleagues and I go for a brisk walk, savouring the fresh air. 7:30 pm: I finally arrive home after 10 hours in the office. I was supposed to have an online lecture at 6 pm, but work commitments decided otherwise. I make my dinner, pop on a face mask and change my bed sheets before bed at 10 pm. Today’s total: €0.00 5:30 am: My alarm rings, signalling the start of my day. Since I am working from home today, there’s no need to commute to the office, but I still have a gym class to attend. 6:00 am: I head out for my 6:30 am class. I usually attend HIIT classes, which I find provide me with a great boost for the day ahead. 8:30 am: I set up my workstation and get started on audit workpapers, client meetings, and internal catch-up meetings. 1:00 pm: I decide to take a walk to Hatch coffee in Blackrock and get a latte (€4.10), arguably the best coffee spot in Dublin!

I walk our neighbour’s dog for an hour – I started doing this since Christmas as the owner is elderly and I typically do it twice a week and charge €15. Today’s total: €4.10 5:00 am: My alarm gets me up as usual. I get ready and head to my 6:30 am gym class. 8:30 am: I arrive at work. 12:00 pm: Coffee, work, meetings, repeat. 5:30 pm: This evening after work all of us associates on my team are heading out for some drinks at a nearby bar. Why are Thursday evenings so busy!? We were like sardines in the bar. We are allowed to expense two drinks per person and so I only pay for one drink (€11.40). 10:00 pm: I get the bus home using my Leap card. Today’s total: €11.40 8:00 am: I am working from home again today, so my alarm goes off a bit later. It feels like a nice welcome to the weekend ahead. I grab a bite to eat before setting up my desk, untangling many cables and turning on my monitors. 1:00 pm: I head for a much-needed coffee at Bear Market (€4.20) and make my own lunch when I get back. 6:30 pm: I head to an evening gym class. My gym is near a Dunnes, and so after my class I head in and get my weekly groceries. It comes to €41, but I use my voucher from my parents, which allows me to save a bit more each month. Today’s total: €4.20 8:00 am: I decide to head out for a run; it’s great to be injury-free once again. I was truly going insane not being able to get my movement in for those three long months. I treat myself to a coffee and almond croissant afterward in the newly opened Bread41 in Stillorgan (€8.10) before heading home for a study day. 10:00 am: I have upcoming exams in less than six weeks, so today is dedicated to studying and trying to catch up on lectures and tutorials. These exams will be tough, and we have the fear of being fired if we fail them. 4:00 pm: I completed three lectures from 12 pm until now. Time for a break. I have a chicken salad with couscous and brown bread. 6:00 pm: Back to the grind. More studying and practicing exam questions. The ACA exams are demanding, but I am motivated and have a study plan in place to help me (hopefully…) succeed. Once fully qualified, the average Chartered Accountant in Dublin is on a salary of €101,000 per annum, which is a huge motivating factor given that I’m only on €31,500 at the moment. 10:00 pm: That was a long day. I wind down from studying by watching some TV, grab a shower, and head to bed. Today’s total: €8.10 8:00 am: I wake up to a later alarm and get ready for the day. I have an in-person lecture at 12 pm this afternoon, so I decide to walk into town instead of getting the bus as I am not going to the gym today. I was tempted to go for a run, but decided against it as trying to avoid my injury from returning. 10:00 am: I meet my friend before my lecture, and we get a coffee (€4.30). 2:00 pm: We have a break, where they provide a free lunch consisting of sandwiches and finger food. 4:00 pm: Once the lecture finishes, I get the Luas back home. 5:30 pm: I arrive home and make a big dinner so that I can bring leftovers to work tomorrow. 7:00 pm: I walk my neighbour’s dog this evening and earn €15. 9:00 pm: Doomscrolling on TikTok once again, head to bed at 10:30 pm and set my alarm for another week of work and study. Today’s total: €4.30 *** What I learned - Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Sunday Summary: The Manhattan Office Market’s Return to Form

Time Published: 2025-04-06T13:00:19Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy After some fits and spurts, it appears Manhattan’s office market might have finally recovered, five years after COVID-19. Things looked promising last year, when office leasing hit a full-year volume of 33.3 million square feet after dropping roughly 50 percent in 2020 to 19 million square feet, and it seems the good times kept on rolling. Leasing reached 11.4 million square feet in the first quarter of 2025, the fourth consecutive increase in quarterly demand and the borough’s strongest three-month volume since the 13.2 million square feet leased in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to a Colliers (CIGI) report. And a look at the top leases of the quarter is also something worth spending your Sunday celebrating as none came in below 300,000 square feet, with Jane Street’s nearly 1 million-square-foot expansion and renewal at Brookfield (BN)’s 250 Vesey Street leading the pack followed by the United Nations’ 425,190-square-foot renewal at 2 United Nations Plaza. There were several other deals signed last quarter worth highlighting, including Universal Music Group’s rumored 336,000-square-foot lease at Penn 2 crossing the finish line and law firm Kirkland & Ellis expanding its New York City presence by leasing 131,000 square feet at 900 Third Avenue for a new office. Speaking of rumored deals getting finalized, Goodwin Procter secured 250,000 square feet at 200 Fifth Avenue, a deal that Commercial Observer reported the law firm was in negotiations for weeks ago. And it seems like this activity won’t be limited to just the first quarter. The New York Post reported that several large tenants are currently looking to secure spaces of 350,000 square feet and above, while CO had the scoop that Apollo Global Management (APO) is in talks to take just under 100,000 square feet at 9 West 57th Street. Everything’s coming up real estate But the gangbusters leasing activity isn’t the only thing to give real estate cause for celebration. There are also bidding wars and big dollars for space, with Ralph Lauren and LVMH duking it out to either buy or sign a high-priced lease for the ground-floor storefront at 109 Prince Street; PGIM Real Estate closing on a massive $3 billion capital fund for data center projects; Burlington dropping more than $257 million to acquire an Inland Empire warehouse from BlackRock; and PMG landing $215 million to build the 38 West Eleventh Residences near Downtown Miami. Yet, nobody might be having a better week than New York Mayor Eric Adams, and that might play in real estate’s favor as well. Adams had his federal corruption charges dropped by a judge — who also removed the ability to bring them back to life in the future — leading Hizzoner swiftly afterward to announce he had switched party affiliations and would run for re-election as an independent in the November general election. That move could clear the field for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to clinch the Democratic primary race in June and set up an Adams vs. Cuomo general election. Despite the two candidates having considerable baggage, it could be a win-win scenario for real estate. Both have long been friends to the industry (and Cuomo has recently doubled down on that by apologizing to the Real Estate Board of New York for passing the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019) and it could knock from contention more progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani, who has vowed to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments. Now to harsh your mellow, but … Unfortunately, it wasn’t all good news this week. Some more buildings faced distress. Rialto Capital hit Thor Equities and Premiere Equities with a foreclosure at their 25-27 Mercer Street retail condo after they defaulted on a $10 million loan. Special servicer CW Asset Management filed a pre-foreclosure on Metro Loft Management’s 180 Water Street after it defaulted on a $265 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. (Metro Loft’s Nathan Berman told CO it will avoid foreclosure by settling its debts.) Meanwhile, that $401 million deal former boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. reportedly made to acquire more than 1,000 units in Upper Manhattan might not be the knockout it seems, with public records not showing those properties changing hands and reports saying that Mayweather bought only a small stake in the portfolio. Over on the West Coast, Los Angeles’ controversial “mansion tax” — which slaps a levy on high-dollar sales of most property types in the city — has led to an up to 50 percent drop in transactions above $5 million since it went into effect two years ago and created only about $632.6 million in revenue for the city, according to a study by the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies. Also, the Los Angeles office market has reached its post-pandemic bottom and is expected to stay there for a while, with the city recording 3.4 million square feet of leases in the first quarter, a drop from the previous quarter, according to a Savills report. And, while the moves in the New York City political scene could be a boon to real estate, the same might not be said about what’s happening in the White House. President Donald Trump’s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, an important source of labor for the construction industry, coupled with historically high inflation, have made it even harder to fill construction jobs. A 2024 study found that 92 percent of construction firms with open salaried positions are having trouble filling those roles. “One thing that over the last 10 years that actually kept the construction workforce afloat was the increased migration that we had into the U.S.,” Gregory Kraut, co-founder and CEO of owner KPG Funds, told CO. “In one day, we had about 20 percent of our workforce disappear because of Trump’s immigration stance. There’s a whole underbelly of construction that relies on those people.” And the construction industry was dealt another blow with Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement, which would implement a 10 percent tariff on all imports to the United States, along with steeper tariffs on other countries, including China and those in the European Union. “When the tariffs took effect last month, glass prices went up 10 percent,” Eli Moyal, founder of design-build company Chapter, told CO. “Now, with the new tariffs … we could see up to a 30 percent increase in glass prices.” Those tariffs and the crackdown on immigration have had another effect: stopping many international tourists from wanting to visit the United States. That could have a significant impact on hotel and hospitality in New York City, the nation’s top urban tourist destination. “It’s not good, obviously,” Vijay Dandapani, president and CEO of the Hotel Association of New York City, told CO. “As yet, we in New York City haven’t felt it in any significant way. Nothing material yet.” Farewell, Women’s History Month Last week saw the end of Women’s History Month, and CO marked the occasion by talking to some important women in the industry. We sat down with Melissa Román Burch, the Forest City Ratner and Lendlease alum who is now chief operating officer for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, to talk about the Brooklyn Army Terminal and MADE Bush Terminal projects; dived into the careers of Lorie Hanson, Pharrah Jackson and Pamela LeVault, top professionals at lender Greystone; and looked at how brokerage Platinum Properties — led by Dezireh Eyn and Teresa Stephenson — has been moving beyond their Financial District roots to find success in other locales like North Brooklyn.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Clontarf finished the Energia All-Ireland League regular season on top of Division 1A by overtaking St Mary’s with a 47-19 win over the latter at Castle Avenue to secure a home semi-final in a fortnight’s time. The visitors, already assured of a home semi-final, fielded a somewhat weakened side to allow key players a respite. Leading 19-14 at half-time, Clontarf pulled clear with four second-half tries and will now host Lansdowne on April 19th, while St Mary’s will welcome the champions Cork Constitution to Templeville Road. Con completed their regular season campaign by sharing 14 tries with Terenure in an entertaining 47-45 win at Temple Hill in a repeat of last year’s final. Centre Ethan Reilly scored four tries for a Terenure side which was playing its first dead rubber in four seasons, in what was also Seán Skehan’s final game as head coach after the most successful era in the club’s history to date. Lansdowne warmed up for the playoffs by dipping deep into their squad for a 26-13 home win over relegated Garryowen, and their only defeat in their last nine games was a 49-46 loss at Castle Avenue to the last kick of the game. A UCD side featuring eight players on Leinster’s books, including four who played in the province’s win over the Sharks in Durban a week previously, preserved their 1A status with a 40-10 win at Young Munster. They were also indebted to City of Armagh’s somewhat surprising 29-24 loss at home to Ballynahinch. City of Armagh now host UCC in next week’s 1A/1B promotion/relegation semi-finals after the students climbed above Old Wesley with a 38-5 win over 1B champions Old Belvedere. Old Wesley missed out after a 40-28 defeat to Blackrock, who next week visit Nenagh Ormond in the other semi-final. Shannon suffered back-to-back relegations despite a 66-12 win at home to Queen’s, while Highfield avoided a relegation playoff with a 43-42 bonus-point win at Naas, while Trinity were restricted to two tries in their 20-7 win at home to Nenagh. Trinity will now host Greystones in the 1B/2A semi-finals after the latter edged out Corinthians on points difference (+169 to +159) thanks to a 15-13 win in Navan, while the Galway club were frustratingly one try short of a bonus point in their 19-12 win at home to Ballymena. Cashel will host Barnhall in the other semi-final. Navan will host Galwegians in the 2A/2B semi-finals after the latter overtook UL Bohemians on the final day thanks to a 39-7 win in Skerries and Sligo’s 12-8 win over the Limerick club. Sligo thus finished above Skerries in the relegation playoff spot on points difference. Dungannon host Clogher Valley in the other semi-final. Enniscorthy pipped Midleton to the Division 2C title with a 29-26 win away to Belfast Harlequins, while the Cork side were losing 26-24 away to Monkstown. Midleton must now refocus in hosting Dolphin in the 2B/2C playoffs, while Skerries host Ballyclare in the other semi-final.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Rocket Lab USA class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/RKLB or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Tariffs: Are A Recession And Bear Market Inevitable?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday.

Title: No match for Marty Morrissey when it comes to RTÉ moonlighters
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/04/06/no-match-for-marty-morrissey-when-it-comes-to-rte-moonlighters/
Time Published: 2025-04-06T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
When RTÉ began compiling a quarterly register of external activities documenting requests by staff to engage in side hustles, it was assumed the most eager moonlighters would be young influencers with large Instagram followings. On the contrary, it turns out there’s no party like a Marty party when it comes to sideline gigs. The list of staff who requested permission from RTÉ for an outside event during the second and third quarters of last year, released under freedom of information legislation, shows Marty Morrissey is the undisputed king of the liggers. Despite not being a client of agent to the stars Noel Kelly, Morrissey requested permission for five external activities in the second quarter of last year and 22 in the third quarter. RTÉ will not disclose how much staff are paid for their sidelines and will not say whether they were granted or refused permission. Many will presumably be unpaid, including those for charitable causes. Marty’s gigs included emceeing the Repak Environmental Awards in the Shelbourne Hotel and the Supervalu Tidy Town Awards in Croke Park, along with interviewing the cast of Riverdance about their careers. The list for the fourth quarter will presumably include what sounds like his most lucrative outside gig: fronting the Marty Party holiday package in the Costa del Sol last October where holidaymakers were entertained by the likes of Tommy Fleming and Sharon Shannon. Where does he get time for the day job? Not that Morrissey, who had to return his free Renault last year after the Ryan Tubridy payments scandal, was the only sports presenter juggling jobs last year. [ Marty Morrissey: ‘I’m an only child of an only-child dad and an only-child mum. I’ve no aunts, uncles or first cousins’Opens in new window ] The second and third most requests came from the sport department, with presenter Darragh Maloney seeking permission for 17 outside gigs during the two quarters and fellow broadcaster Jacqui Hurley seeking 15, including presumably hard-hitting interviews with retired rugby star Brian O’Driscoll about his Land Rover Defender and Q&As with rugby player James Ryan and jockey Rachel Blackmore on behalf of Volvo. Michael O’Leary is estimated to be worth about €900 million, mostly down to his stake in Ryanair. But he also has an expanding property portfolio with his 2,000-plus acres in Co Westmeath leading to the nickname “The Mullingar Magnier” after the Coolmore Stud boss, who is estimated to own more than 10,000 acres in Co Tipperary. In Dublin, O’Leary owns several period piles which he lets out, including houses on Raglan Road and Clyde Road in Dublin 4. When it comes to pursuing his rent, he’s not shy of a trip to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), the arbiter of landlord-tenant disputes, even if it’s over only €754. Last week the RTB published a judgment following a case taken by Bradley Investments, O’Leary’s investment vehicle, against a couple who underpaid their €2,260 monthly rent at a property his company owns in Blackrock, Dublin by about €754 one month. The couple said they had cut the rent for one month because they had been forced to move out while the house was painted, which took 10 days. They say they initially objected to the house being painted, arguing it would be “too disruptive”. When O’Leary’s company suggested a reduction in their rent for the month of the painting, they said this was “an insult” as it did not include any compensation. However, when Bradley Investments insisted it needed to paint the place, they moved out for 10 days and reduced the amount they paid. At the RTB O’Leary’s representative argued the tenants had rejected the suggestion that a portion of the rent would be waived, adding there was no proof they moved out for the 10-day period and should have paid their rent in full. However, the RTB found in favour of the tenants, ruling O’Leary’s representatives did not have “carte blanche” to carry out painting or repairs at the expense of the tenants’ right to “peaceful occupation”. Perhaps the reason O’Leary was so keen to keep up the house’s appearance was because of a former resident – it’s where his wife Anita Farrell lived before marrying the Mullingar man. Speaking of Coolmore Stud, the latest addition to the board of Horse Racing Ireland is Anne-Marie O’Brien, the wife of Aidan, the trainer at John Magnier’s Ballydoyle Stables. A trainer in her own right, she grew up in the business – her father Joe Crowley was previously Coolmore’s head trainer. She was nominated courtesy of the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and appointed by Minister for Agriculture Martin Heydon, himself from good bloodstock country in Kilcullen, Co Kildare. Hot on the heels of Wanderers FC, Ireland’s second oldest rugby club, getting planning permission for a tricky conversion to their clubhouse on Merrion Road, Old Belvedere has lobbed in an application to expand its own base on Anglesea Road with a larger bar and, of course, three padel courts. The decision to add the padel courts was endorsed by members in a recent egm, with 97 per cent voting for the game that seems to be smashing squash and tennis in the popularity stakes. We can guess which way neighbour Dermot Desmond, an honorary life member of the club and devotee of padel, voted. Rogue lawyer Michael Lynn has obviously been keeping busy in prison reading journalist Michael O’Farrell’s book about him. Fugitive: The Michael Lynn Story was published a year ago by Merrion Press and Irish Academic Press. But it was only last week that Lynn, represented by John P O’Donohoe solicitors in Waterford, filed a High Court defamation action against O’Farrell and the book’s publishers. Perhaps he discovered it in the prison library. Mediahuis boss Peter Vandermeersch has been living in Ireland since taking over as publisher of the Independent stable of newspapers in 2019. Now he is turning his journalist’s eye on the “history, culture and paradoxes” of Ireland in a new book aimed at the Dutch market. Described as “not a classic travel guide”, it is instead “a quest for the soul of Éire”. [ ‘Talbot Street is known as Tablet Street now’: Will a €2m makeover be enough to turn things around?Opens in new window ] We wonder if he’ll mention Talbot Street, his favourite Dublin street and the location of Mediahuis HQ. In a blog post five years ago, he rhapsodised about the cosmopolitan stretch where you will find the most “junkies, nutters and crackpots” in the capital. And no, he wasn’t talking about his colleagues. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

(AP Photo: Julio Cortez) It's worth watching. With everything that's happening in the world, where is Australia's sovereign wealth fund (the Future Fund) investing on behalf of Australians? It recently released its six monthly investment update. The update shows what stocks it bought and sold between June and December, and what returns its stock holdings are generating. We've previously written about the controversy surrounding a list of 30 "defence companies" the Future Fund has direct shareholdings in (i.e. global weapons manufacturers and aerospace companies). You can see the original list here. Let's revisit that list to see how the Future Fund's investments in those stocks are going (according to its Periodic Investment Report 31 December 2024). The federal government has been accused of politicising the Future Fund by changing its mandate, but its investments have always been tangled up in politics. The latest data show that, between June and December, the value the fund's shareholdings in the companies on that list jumped by $94 million. The value of its shareholdings increased significantly in Axon Enterprise Inc. (+132.5 per cent), Elbit Systems (+102 per cent), Lockheed Martin (+52.5 per cent) and Thales (+41.98 per cent). The value of its shareholdings in Northrop Grumman (+33.4 per cent), the Boeing Co. (+26.6 per cent), and RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon Technologies) (+13.9 per cent) also rose noticeably. Many of those companies are the subject of international divestment campaigns. The table below shows the value of the fund's shareholdings in those companies. In the table, a change in the value of the shareholdings reflects the Future Fund's decision to buy (or sell) more of each stock, an increase (or decrease) in the price of each stock, or both. Norway's sovereign wealth fund has many of those companies on its exclusions list for things like human rights violations, production of nuclear weapons, and particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms. However, there's currently a debate in Norway about the wisdom or otherwise of maintaining such strict ethical guidelines for its sovereign wealth fund in today's environment, when the global security landscape is evolving rapidly and defence spending is rising. Just last month, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned these were "momentous and dangerous" times and Europe was now living in "an era of rearmament". With that in mind, another Future Fund investment worth watching is Palantir Technologies. Between June and December, the value of the fund's shareholdings in Palantir increased from $5.5 million to $20 million (+263 per cent). The company's share price jumped by 192 per cent in those six months, and the Future Fund bought more stock, increasing its shares from 144,897 to 163,479. What does Palantir do? Coles plans to deploy data company Palantir's tools across more than 840 supermarkets to cut costs and "redefine how we think about our workforce". At a time of increased food insecurity, Australians should question if this is the right direction. It sits on the frontier of Big Data analytics (it was named after the seeing stones in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings). Early in its life, it received seed funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm, and much of its revenue derives from government clients such as military, immigration departments, and police agencies, in the United States and overseas. It has been the subject of a slew of books about Silicon Valley's billionaires and the deep connection between modern national security and the surveillance state. Its artificial intelligence software has helped US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials conduct workplace raids, family separations and deportations. It's the subject of international divestment campaigns due to its "strategic partnership" with Israel's military. It also works with large companies such as Rio Tinto, WesTrac, and Coles supermarkets (it has offices in Canberra and Sydney). The US billionaire Alex Karp, chief executive and co-founder of the company, published a book in February titled: The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the West. It's currently ranked No.1 on the New York Times bestseller list. In the book, Mr Karp argues "the West" is superior and software and technology companies must forge a deeper bond with the state to help the West maintain its geopolitical and economic dominance this century. Norway's sovereign wealth fund recently took a huge $US1.4 billion position in Palantir (significantly increasing its stake in the company). The Future Fund also piled into Tesla stocks in the second half of last year. Its purchases roughly coincided with the election of US President Donald Trump in November. Elon Musk's electric vehicle company has also been targeted by vandals in recent months amid backlash to his embrace of far-right politics. Between June and December, the value of the Future Fund's Tesla shareholdings jumped from $159.2 million to $472.7 million (+196 per cent). That's nearly half a billion dollars. Tesla's share price jumped by 104 per cent in those six months, and the Future Fund increased its shareholdings by 34.8 per cent (from 537,358 to 724,704 shares). But we'll have to see what happens to those shareholdings when the Future Fund releases its next six-monthly investment update. Tesla shares have plummeted 40 per cent in value this year, due partly to the global backlash against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has unveiled its ultra-fast charger that promises to take just five minutes to fully power EVs — putting heat on rival Tesla in the process. Interestingly, the Future Fund also owns shares in Tesla's rival, the Chinese car maker BYD, but its shareholdings in BYD are small in comparison. And the fortunes of BYD are tracking in the opposite direction of Tesla's right now. BYD generated $170 billion in revenue in 2024 (soaring past Tesla's annual revenue of $155.5 billion). It reported a 73 per cent surge in net profit to a record $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter last year, and its share price is up 32 per cent this year. Between June and December, the value of the Future Fund's BYD shareholdings rose from $10.6 million to $17.9 million (+69 per cent), and it bought 88,900 more shares.

Title: Donald Trump delays TikTok ban, but will it remain available in the U.S. in June? The truth behind the decision

Editions: En/lifestyle/us-news People have been expecting news on this matter President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will delay the enforcement of a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations. The move extends the deadline by 75 days, pushing it to June 18, as discussions continue to determine TikTok's future in the United States. The law, passed in 2024 with bipartisan support, mandates ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese owners or face a nationwide ban. Lawmakers and national security experts have raised concerns over TikTok's data collection practices and ties to the Chinese government, citing the app as a potential risk. ByteDance has pushed back, emphasizing that 60% of its ownership lies with global institutional investors, 20% with its Chinese founders, and the remaining 20% with employees, including those in the U.S. In his post on Truth Social, Trump expressed optimism about progress made toward securing an agreement that would ensure TikTok's continued operation in the U.S. "My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump wrote. "We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal." ByteDance confirmed that negotiations with U.S. officials are ongoing but noted that any deal would require approval under Chinese law. A key sticking point remains TikTok's content-recommendation algorithm, which the U.S. law bars from being controlled by ByteDance but is critical to the app's functionality. China has opposed any sale involving the algorithm, further complicating negotiations. Reports suggest that an agreement to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations into a new company, majority-owned by American investors such as Oracle or Blackrock, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake, was close to being finalized earlier this week. However, the deal hit a roadblock after Trump announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to withhold approval. The tariffs have also spurred financial market volatility, further raising the stakes for the administration. As the June deadline approaches, TikTok's future remains uncertain. The app briefly shut down in January following legal challenges but resumed operations after assurances from Trump that the ban would not be enforced while negotiations continued. ByteDance has described its discussions with the U.S. government as "constructive" but acknowledged unresolved issues. Potential investors such as Oracle, which already hosts TikTok's U.S. user data, and Amazon have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations. With multiple parties involved and diplomatic tensions high, the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether TikTok avoids a ban and secures a path forward in the American market. Trump's decision to delay enforcement reflects the broader complexities of U.S.-China relations, blending national security concerns with economic and political challenges. As the June 18 deadline looms, all eyes will be on Washington and Beijing as they seek a resolution to one of the most contentious tech disputes in recent history. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Title: ‘Nowhere to hide.’ How Apple and others in Silicon Valley are bracing for Trump tariffs

The iPhone is a quintessentially 21st century product — Californian in its creation and design and now enmeshed in the global economy.Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, though in recent years the Cupertino-based company has made more of its products in India, Vietnam and other nations. In all, the tech giant says it relies on more than 50 countries and regions to put AirPods, iPads and MacBooks in the hands of consumers.Now, that global supply chain is under siege.This week, President Donald Trump said he would impose a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries on Saturday. His administration also added tariffs of 34% on China, 46% on Vietnam and 26% on India.“Apple has nowhere to hide,” said Eric Harwit, professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “No matter where they’re making their technology, they’re going to be suffering, they’re going to see higher costs.”Trump’s sweeping tariffs have rattled both investors and some of the world’s most valuable tech companies that have fueled the global economy and Silicon Valley’s growth. They’ve also raised questions about whether these global businesses will pass the higher costs onto consumers or slash their payrolls.Apple has been especially hard hit. Its stock plunged more than 9% on Thursday and dropped another 7% on Friday to close at $188.38.Share prices of other tech titans, including Google’s parent company Alphabet, Meta, chipmaker Nvidia and Amazon, also saw big declines, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite to fall 5.8% on Friday — more than 20% below its record set in December. The unease reflects worries among investors that the tariffs could cause lasting damage, potentially making it harder for the U.S. tech industry to compete globally and dominate the race to deploy artificial intelligence technology, analysts said.The duties also are expected to drive up the costs of consumer electronics, including the iPhone, as products become more expensive to produce.“Technology pervades everyday life and these tariffs are attacks on consumer electronics,” said Todd O’Boyle, vice president of technology policy at the Chamber of Progress, a trade group. “They’re attacks on everything that we buy and that includes any foreign parts with global supply chains.”The levies could cause consumers to pay as much as $2,500 more for an iPhone, which costs roughly $1,000, depending on the model.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also produce consumer gadgets but make billions of dollars annually from ads purchased by brands in other countries, which some analysts say could also drop if these advertisers pull back spending.Meta declined to comment, but its annual report cites the possibility that tariffs or a trade dispute could result in a drop of its China-based ad revenue. The company has also expanded production of its mixed reality headsets in Vietnam.Alphabet — which makes phones, earbuds, smart speakers and other consumer electronics — also has cited tariffs among the manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm its business. It did not respond to a request for comment.The White House said it’s imposing tariffs because it wants to shift more manufacturing jobs back to America.Relying too much on foreign producers could threaten economic security by “rendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks,” Trump said in his executive order.“These America First economic policies delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and everyone from Main Street to Wall Street is again going to thrive as President Trump secures our nation’s economic future,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai.He cited recent multibillion-dollar commitments made by companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Apple to build more manufacturing plants in the United States.The tech industry has been bracing for more tariffs ahead of what the president dubbed “Liberation Day.”The Trump administration already imposed tariffs on certain auto parts and imported aluminum and steel, materials that tech companies use to build data centers that store and manage computer hardware and equipment.The administration spared those materials, along with copper, from its latest tariffs. Semiconductors that power electronics and AI systems also were excluded from what the White House dubbed “reciprocal tariffs.”Exactly how tech companies will respond to the costs of tariffs is still unclear. While Trump wants businesses to shift manufacturing back to the United States, they could also move production to places with lower tariff rates. It would take years for businesses to build new factories.It’s also possible these tariffs will not remain.During Trump’s first term, Apple got exemptions from tariffs imposed on imports from China for some of its products including its smartwatch. Trump’s tariffs in his second term go well beyond China, affecting more countries.Nick Vyas, founding director of the Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute at USC’s Marshall School of Business, said the Trump administration is signaling to businesses that simply shifting production to places outside China isn’t enough.“‘Every dollar that I open up my market for you, I need you to open up the market for me [to] the same degree,’” he said, describing Trump’s thinking.Some tech companies have made efforts to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S.Among them is Santa Clara-based chipmaker Nvidia, one of the world’s most valuable companies.While it appears Nvidia would be spared from the brunt of the tariffs because of the exemption to semiconductors, some industry observers said more tariffs could still be coming.Trump told reporters on Thursday that “chips are starting very soon” when asked if tariffs for chips are off the table.“We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around,” Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at a Q&A with analysts last month. “Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.”Apple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston.The company said in its annual report that “substantially all” of its manufacturing is done by partners primarily located in mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Shifting where iPhones and other Apple products are made is not easy.China has engineers who can meet the high quality specifications on Apple products and the U.S. doesn’t have that great a number of engineers with those same skills, Harwit said.“It’s really that level of manufacturing expertise that Apple developed over many years that make it very difficult for Apple to give up on China and for the U.S. to find the skilled workers really needed in the United States to meet their needs,” he added.Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said that it would take Apple three years and $30 billion to move just 10% of their supply chain from Asia to the U.S. Plus, the iPhone’s price tag would increase to $3,500, he estimated.“The chances that Apple and the overall tech supply chain moves to the U.S. is a fantasy, fictional tale, unless you like $3,500 iPhones, $2,500 TVs and $300 AirPods,” Ives said. Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, though in recent years the Cupertino-based company has made more of its products in India, Vietnam and other nations.

And if you’re a Costco Executive member, you can get one for yourself or your business with an absolutely incredible $31,500 discount. (!) Fleet electrification expert Tony Nisam took to LinkedIn yesterday to post a deal that he ran across at a Washington State Costco that stacks a $25,500 manufacturer rebate with $3,000 in “regular” Costco Member Savings, $2,750 in “LIMITED-TIME” Manufacturer to Member Incentives, plus an additional $250 for Costco Executive members. Do a bit of math (add up 25,500 + 3,000 + $2,750 + 250), and you’ll calculate an almost unheard of $31,500 discount on one of the best, most capable commercial vans on the market – ICE or electric. And that’s before you factor in the 0% interest financing (72 mo.) being advertised at Blade Chevrolet, the Mount Vernon, Washington, where VIN 2G58J2TY6S9104313 (the exact van shown, below) is shown as stock number 16757. If you’re not a Costco member yet and you’re looking for a new truck for your business or even a unique #vanlife ride with zero emissions, modern tech, and a nationwide dealer network, GM makes that $130 Executive membership seem like a no-brainer. “But wait,” says the floating, disembodied ghost of the great Billy Mays. “There’s more!” In addition to the $31,500 worth of discounts Costco Executive members get, there are deals to be had on chargers AND a number of other state and local utility incentives your business might qualify for, bringing the cost of adding a new Chevy Brightdrop to your fleet even lower. In northern Illinois, for example, ComEd commercial customers can get up to $7,500 in rebates for a new Brightdrop Zevo van. Is a $39,000 price cut enough to get you to take a look at a new Brightdrop? At $45,235 (from a starting price of $84,235), can you afford not to? Head down to the comments and let us know.

Title: Trade deficits happen for good reasons — not only from unfair practices

On April 2, the Trump administration announced a system of tariffs on imports into the United States. The executive order imposed 10% tariffs for imports from all countries (excluding Canada and Mexico, which remain subject to tariffs imposed over the last two months) which take effect April 5, with higher tariffs for countries with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficit, to begin April 9. This means that imports from the European Union will be tariffed at 20%, while imports from China will see tariffs of 34% (see here for the full list of tariff rates.) In the short run, these tariffs will lead to increased prices, particularly for household products, cars, construction materials and some food items. As an example, the U.S. imports the bulk of its jasmine rice from Thailand which will have a reciprocal tariff of 36%. The extent to which the 36% tariff will be borne by rice farmers in Thailand, importers, grocery stores or households depends on the relative price sensitivity of each of these groups, but economic consensus is that households will bear at least part of that cost through higher prices. Items from toothbrushes to cars to washing machines will be similarly affected. Changes in the relative price of some goods and an increase in economic uncertainty around the profitability of some lines of business will lead to changes in investment decisions by companies in the United States. Retailers like Target, Amazon and Walmart will see margins tightened and will have decreased incentive to open new stores or expand existing retail locations. Auto manufacturers will delay production as they seek to understand the impact on their business from the changes in tariffs. One early example is Stellantis, the manufacturer of American auto brands Chrysler and Jeep, who announced on April 3 that it will pause production on some auto lines leading to temporary layoffs for 900 hourly U.S. workers. Delays in production and investment are likely to continue as uncertainty about the way that these policies will alter the U.S. economy are digested. These reductions in investment and production delays increase the near-term likelihood of a recession. If tariffs persist, they will change the composition of the U.S. economy. Tariffs increase the prices at which domestic producers of tariffed products can sell their goods. This increases potential profits in protected industries, leading to higher prices and often lower quality for manufactured goods. It also leads to shifts in the nature of goods produced in the economy. Previously profitable sectors of the economy will see decreased demand as prices rise which will lead to layoffs and a short-term increase in unemployment. If the tariffs continue, jobs will eventually migrate to more tariff-protected segments of the economy. This will lead to overall declines in growth however, as these tariff-protected regions of the economy grow because of the increased profits associated with tariffs as opposed to increases in the demand for their products. The executive order issued this week gives justification for the imposition of tariffs as “... a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption ...” However, the tariff rate imposed on our foreign trade partners seems to be proportional to the ratio of the U.S. trade deficit with that country divided by the total dollar value of goods imported from that country, with a minimum rate of 10%. As such, the policy enshrines the idea that if there is a trade deficit, it is because of unfair trade policies on the part of foreign counterparties. Yet this is largely not consistent with the nature of trade. Just as most households run a trade deficit with the grocery store (“importing” goods from the store in exchange for money), we choose to import goods from abroad because they can be produced more efficiently there and we would rather use our productive capacity to produce higher-margin goods and services. We do not produce significant amounts of jasmine rice in the U.S. because doing so would be expensive for us and we would rather use our land and labor to produce goods and services that allow us to profit from our unique productive abilities. Complicating the role of tariffs is the reality that one cannot decouple foreign demand for American-produced goods, which reduces the trade deficit, from foreign demand for American assets, which increases it. When a U.S. distributor of luxury Swiss watches pays $5 million for a shipment of timepieces, the Swiss manufacturer of those timepieces can choose what to do with that $5 million. They can use those dollars to purchase American-made goods, or they can use that money to purchase American assets like real estate, stocks, bonds or Treasury securities. If they choose to purchase assets, then there is an increase in the trade deficit, which measures differences in the value of the shipment of goods (as opposed to assets) across borders. As such, the size of the trade imbalance with a country is inextricably linked to the relative desirability of American assets. The attractiveness in recent decades of American assets, and foreigners’ willingness to purchase them, is an important driver of our trade balance. This foreign investment in the U.S. because of the desirability of American assets has allowed U.S. companies to hire additional workers, produce additional products, and offer dividends that would not otherwise have been possible. A cooling of trade between countries as a result of tariffs will reduce this source of capital. One open question is whether the tariff announcement this week represents a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy that will persist throughout President Trump’s term in office, or whether it is the opening offer in bilateral trade negotiations to be had with our trading partners over the coming weeks, as has happened with Canada and Mexico since Trump’s inauguration in January. Retaliatory tariffs from across the world is also a high likelihood. Either way, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of policy in recent months and the questions that remain about the current proposal run the real risk of decreasing short-term investment and hiring by American companies and the desirability of American assets to foreigners. These risks have increased the likelihood of both inflation and decreased growth in the near term.

Title: If Bitcoin Holds This Level Between Now And April 15, Arthur Hayes Says 'We Are Out Of The Woods'

After days of anxious waiting, President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” came and went. As anticipated, equity and cryptocurrency markets did not like the idea of fresh and broad tariffs. A broad market sell-off ensued in after-hours trading as the president read off his chart outlining “reciprocal tariffs” on almost every country in the world, including uninhabited islands. Bitcoin, in particular, dropped 5% from $88,500 to just over $82,000 and continues to trade near these lows, eroding earlier market optimism. Amid the rout, one prominent analyst has pointed to a key level to watch. Don't Miss: According to BitMEX founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes, the $76,500 price point is the level to watch for Bitcoin. “if BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods,” he wrote in a Wednesday X post following Trump’s tariff announcements. Mrkt no likey "Liberation Day", if $BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods. Don't get chopped up! The price level aligns with the three-month price low Bitcoin hit on March 11. On March 20, Hayes speculated that the level was the line in the sand for the asset, suggesting that the worst of the recent correction is over and that it is unlikely the asset will break below the level before making a run for new highs. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? For confirmation of Hayes’ analysis, bulls will want to see a strong bounce from that level should Bitcoin retest it. The analyst’s view comes as he continues to maintain that the leading digital asset is on course to more than double in price this year. Specifically, Hayes maintains that Bitcoin can still hit $250,000 by the end of the year. This prediction is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to pivot from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing due to political pressure as Trump seeks to reduce the U.S.’s trade deficit from 7% to 3% by 2028. In this scenario, the liquidity created is expected to boost risk markets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In the analyst’s telling, this pivot may have already started following remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in March. He announced a slowdown of the central bank's quantitative tightening efforts that kicked off Tuesday while stating that he now expected tariff inflation to be “transitory.” See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. With the move to slow down quantitative tightening, Hayes argued that the apex bank was already on course to create an extra $240 billion in liquidity. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from QT to QE for treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end,” he submitted in an essay released on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hayes’ expectation of greater market liquidity is not limited to the U.S. The analyst also expects China and Europe to join in the money printing—the former to defend the dollar-yuan exchange rate, the latter to build armies as the U.S. under Trump looks set to step back from guaranteeing its protection. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to fall, trading below $82,000 in an over 5% decline over the past 24 hours. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Shocked upset elderly couple getting bad news, finding fraud, money stealing, loss, overspending, ... More financial problem, holding calculator, using laptop, staring at monitor Most indicators are misleading investors right now, with some looking rosy and others seemingly saying it’s time to panic. So today we’re going to parse through the noise and look at what’s really going on under the hood of the US economy. Then I’m going to give you our latest “CEF Insider intel” on what to do with stocks—and funds (specifically closed-end funds) that hold them. We’re also going to dig into one bond fund yielding an outsized 13% that’s set to benefit as uncertainty grows. Consider the CNN Fear & Greed index, a closely watched sentiment indicator. As I write this, it’s showing a five-alarm fire. Fear & Greed Index Meantime, let’s look at the VIX, the market’s so-called “fear gauge.” You’d think that with the S&P 500 just closing out its worst quarter since 2022, the VIX would be spiking. Instead, crickets. VIX Quiet The VIX, which measures stock volatility, is at 22.3 as I write this—somewhat high territory compared to the last decade, but still pretty low in light of the worry the market has experienced going into April 2 tariff announcements. But in really moody times, this indicator rises to over 25, which it did several times in—you guessed it—2022. I’m guessing that if you’re reading this, you may also be thinking of 2022 right now, since that year also saw fears of inflation and a stagnant economy that caused markets to sell off. So today we’re going to drill into that and look at two reasons why, no, 2025 is not 2022 all over again. We’ll do it by looking at both inflation and stagnation to see if, in fact, either (or both!) are reasons for investors to worry. (Sneak preview: The answer is no—but we do need to be more selective and look at areas beyond stocks, like corporate bonds, including the bond fund we’ll talk about below.) I dislike pointing this out, because I almost always get comments from readers who (rightly!) tell me that prices keep going up in supermarkets and elsewhere. But, well … Inflation, on a year-over-year basis, remains below 3%, according to the consumer price index (CPI). That’s far from the alarming levels we saw in 2022. To be sure, prices are still going up: And as upsetting as that’s been for consumers, the important point for the stock market is the question of how much. We can consider the current rise of 3% year-over-year to be a safe zone. And if you look at the right side of the chart above, you can see that since inflation fell off a cliff in early 2023, it has been slowly (but inconsistently) creeping closer to 2%. The verdict here is clear: Inflation is not trending back to the eye-watering levels we saw in 2022. Yes, we do need to keep an eye on this, but it isn’t reason to panic. But what about the economy as a whole? Earnings Growth Paths BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li pointed to this chart recently when she said in a recent LinkedIn post that corporate earnings are rising “still above the historical trend of 6% to 7%.” In other words, companies are not only growing profits, but they are doing so at a stronger rate than they tend to, on average. It’s also worth noting that the S&P 500 saw earnings rise 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2021, when companies were comparing themselves against the economic shutdowns of 2020. That gives them some additional resilience in the face of tariffs and other unpredictable changes. Investors are totally ignoring that earnings number, as well as the fact that 77% of S&P 500 companies exceeded EPS estimates when they reported earnings in the last quarter. That earnings growth is accompanied by 4.2% revenue growth at the start of 2025 and 2.8% spending growth by consumers after we take inflation into account. I know this is a lot to take in, but the takeaway is that the average American is spending more not just because prices are going up, but because they’re buying more goods and services. Companies, in turn, are taking in more revenue and expanding profit margins. And they’re making their operations more efficient, in turn causing their earnings to rise, too. All of this is good news for investors. So the recent market price decline is a buying opportunity. My beat, of course, is CEFs—often-ignored funds that yield around 8% on average. So let me talk about what all this means for our CEF strategy. The short answer is that we need to be very selective in this environment—and target other corners of the CEF market beyond those funds that hold stocks. In 2025, we’ve seen CEFs hold their own for the most part, with average discounts to net asset value (NAV) for all CEFs around 5%, with stock funds at 6.2%. That might sound generous, but discounts were more like 8.5% in 2022, so this tells us there are fewer CEFs that are generously discounted. This is why we’ve been holding off on adding more equity CEFs to our portfolio this year, choosing to focus instead on corporate-bond CEFs. As I write this, we have just two tickers in our equity-CEF bucket. And we continue to like bond funds—especially those whose managers have been able to buy higher-yielding bonds with long durations. Those bonds are especially well-positioned as interest rates fall (something I see happening as the economy slows, which I expect as we move into the second half of 2025). Case in point: the Nuveen Core Plus Impact Fund (NPCT), a 13%-yielder trading at a 7% discount to NAV today. As I write this, it holds 132 bonds with an average leverage-adjusted effective duration (which measures how much a bond is likely to go up or down in value in relation to interest rates) of 8.7 years. That means NPCT will be able to bring in its bonds’ income streams for nearly a decade. And those bonds’ value will only increase as rates decline. The fact that we can pick this one up at a 7% discount to the value of the bonds it holds is a nice bonus and suggests more price upside ahead.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s barrage of tariffs—with the Federal Reserve poised to blow up the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price dropped sharply after China sparked fears of a “crisis scenario” but has bounced back, breaking its correlation with the stock market. Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock calls bitcoin potentially a “safer bet” than the U.S. dollar, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared bitcoin an emerging “store of value”—comparing it to gold.

More and crypto summit in March ahead of extreme bitcoin price volatility and a looming stock market crash. “Bitcoin is becoming a store of value, gold’s has historically been a store of value,” Bessent told podcaster Tucker Carlson, adding there are “a lot of different stores of value over time.” Bessent’s comments come as stock markets around the world fall sharply in the aftermath of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of trade tariffs that saw the U.S. implement a global baseline import tax of 10% and much higher rates for goods from dozens of countries. “As risk assets continue to sell off, investors may increasingly rotate into traditional hedges like bonds and gold—or into bitcoin, which has shown notable resilience relative to equities in recent days," David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at bitcoin and crypto investment company 21Shares, said via email. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up around 15% so far this year as traders and central banks buy it to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties. “Bitcoin’s price action this week has been a true testament to its investment case as an emerging store of value and potential for uncorrelated returns," Hernandez said. The U.S. stock market has plummeted by around 10% since Trump followed through with his well-telegraphed global tariff regime that was more aggressive than traders had anticipated. Trump himself shared a social media post with a caption reading: “Trump is purposely crashing the market." The bitcoin price has, however, climbed over the course of the week, breaking its recent correlation with the stock market—specifically the tech heavy Nasdaq and the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that includes Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped in recent weeks but has outperformed the "crashing" stock market. "What’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a MAGA problem," Bessent told Carlson, referring to the Trump administration’s Make American Great Again series of policies that are focuses on rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base. “The Trump tariffs have unleashed volatility, notably shaking the U.S. equity markets, but with this, bitcoin’s unique reaction deserves attention,” Joe Burnett, director of market research crypto financial company Unchained, said in emailed comments. "Recalling March 2020, bitcoin rapidly bottomed and recovered first (before U.S. equities), a pattern potentially repeating today as bitcoin hasn’t made new lows since March 11th. This resilience could signal a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Of course, if stocks continue falling aggressively over the coming weeks, it’s reasonable to expect that bitcoin could experience another leg down too.”

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research.

Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks.

Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore.

Title: Why Big Tech Interviews Take So Long. Here’s How To Beat The Process

ByCheryl Robinson ByCheryl Robinson, Contributor. Long interview processes at major tech companies are leaving job seekers waiting weeks for a ... More response. If you’ve ever felt like the interview process at a major tech company drags on forever, you’re not imagining things. A new study from Career.io confirms what many job seekers have suspected: landing a role at a top tech firm often means surviving a long, winding hiring process with the worst offenders keeping you waiting for nearly a month. The study analyzed publicly available data from 14 major U.S. tech companies, ranking them based on how long it typically takes to move from interview to job offer. The results? Some of the biggest names in the business aren’t just giants in innovation—they’re giants in hiring delays, too. At Oracle, candidates often wait close to four weeks for a response—if they receive one at all. According to reviews on Glassdoor, some candidates said their interview process lasted up to two months. Apple isn’t far behind, with an average turnaround time of 22 days. Adobe and Salesforce also require candidates to buckle up for a wait exceeding three weeks. While hiring managers may aim for the perfect fit, they inadvertently drive top talent away. Studies show that 82% of candidates lose interest in a role if the interview process drags on too long. This growing phenomenon, known as interview fatigue, occurs when job seekers become mentally and emotionally exhausted from drawn-out hiring procedures, repetitive interview rounds and unclear timelines. According to insights from Titus Talent, companies risk losing strong candidates not because of poor fit but because of poor processes. Amanda Augustine, a certified career coach at Career.io, says there’s a reason hiring has become more prolonged in recent years. “The tech industry has intensified the interview process, largely due to heightened competition stemming from layoffs,” she explains. “Hiring managers in big tech now hold more leverage than ever, implementing more rigorous and lengthy interview processes to identify the ‘best fit’ among a broader pool of applicants.” That means multiple interview rounds, technical assessments, culture-fit evaluations and follow-up conversations—all before a decision is made. Not every tech company is stuck in the slow lane. According to the report, Uber has the fastest hiring process, averaging just 9.34 days from interview to offer. Amazon (10.11 days) and Netflix (14.23 days) follow close behind. There’s a reason for this efficiency: Uber and Amazon rely heavily on high-turnover frontline workers like drivers and warehouse staff, necessitating a streamlined process. But it’s not just about speed for the sake of speed. Netflix, for example, emphasizes cultural alignment during their process, with multiple interviews and a final “vibe check” to ensure a strong team fit. Augustine notes, “Both Uber and Amazon have a reputation for hiring with flexibility in their workforce. The speed of drivers’ and warehouse workers’ onboarding has resulted in an expedited interview process, highlighting the operational priorities within the tech sector.” Interview fatigue is rising as candidates endure multiple rounds and extended timelines in today’s ... More competitive job market. Lengthy interviews aren’t going away anytime soon, but job seekers can approach them more strategically. Augustine recommends three ways to manage the marathon process: Interviewing at big tech firms may require patience, resilience, and a plan B. But with the right mindset and a few smart moves, candidates can stay in control—even when the process drags on.

Title: BlackRock Will Offer Spot XRP And Solana ETFs, Insider Claims
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-spot-xrp-solana-etfs-insider/
Time Published: 2025-04-05T09:30:44Z

Andrew Parish, the founder of x3 and a frequent source of high-level information on X, has stirred the crypto community with his latest claim that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, “will eventually capitulate and offer both XRP and SOL ETF’s.” Parish conveyed that sources close to the matter have told him “crypto floodgates have opened, 2025 filings expected,” while also suggesting that BlackRock leadership has indicated “we may not be first, but we will give clients choices,” and that “if nothing else, both will be included in crypto asset class products” because “crypto assets are an unprecedented growth opportunity.” This is not the first time Parish has shared alleged insider knowledge that turned out to be accurate. On March 17, he posted an update in which he cited “two SEC sources” who believed that the Ripple case was “very close to ending,” adding that these sources expected “XRP to get serious commodity consideration” and a “greatly reduced fine; GREATLY reduced.” He also emphasized that “new leadership knows this case and how they handle it is a big deal; precedent.” Just two days after Parish released that information, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to X to announce that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would drop its appeal, lending credence to Parish’s track record. It is also worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission actually reduced its penalty significantly from $125 million to $50 million, as revealed by Parish. While Parish’s assertion regarding a future spot XRP ETF offering may seem bold, he is not alone in his assessment. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has similarly predicted that BlackRock will seek to expand its crypto footprint beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Geraci noted three weeks ago, “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” pointing out that in his view “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” According to Geraci, BlackRock’s motivation lies in its current dominance by assets in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. He believes the firm will be reluctant to allow competitors to break ground with major altcoin ETFs, stating that “I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s reasoning underscores a notable shift from BlackRock’s previously cautious stance on additional cryptocurrency ETFs. In July of last year, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, Samara Cohen, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no imminent plans to roll out altcoin products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs, reinforced that perspective in December, saying the company was predominantly focused on its existing crypto investment offerings. Additional remarks from Parish reveal that he has been hearing similar timelines and predictions from unnamed “ETF execs in the know.” In one update posted two weeks ago, Parish mentioned anticipating a variety of spot crypto ETF approvals beginning in Q2, including an expected timeframe of “XRP early Q2,” “LTC early Q2,” “SOL late Q2,” and “HBAR early Q3,” while also pointing to the possibility of “basket” crypto ETF products and leveraged long or short funds. His sources, he said, predict that “2025 is the year of crypto ETF’s.” At press time; XRP traded at $2.04 For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

In the end, the make-up of the top four and the Division 1A play-offs in the Energia All-Ireland League did not go down to the wire. Even so, there is some jostling for home semi-finals and the play-off picture throughout the divisions, as well as the AIL qualifiers. St Mary’s (63 points) top 1A after a seven-year absence but travel with a weakened team to second-placed Clontarf (61), who welcome back Ivan Soroka and need a win to ensure a home semi-final. ‘Tarf could be edged out of the top two by Cork Con, who entertain Terenure, finalists for the last three years but who have lost four in a row. After a transformative five seasons as head coach this will be Sean Skehan’s final game before focusing his energies on the rugby programme in the Terenure school. As indicated by a much-changed selection at home to relegated Garryowen, fourth-placed Lansdowne (56) are contentedly in the semi-finals after a run of one defeat in eight. City of Armagh (27 points) can stay above UCD (25) in the relegation play-off place by winning at home to Ballynahinch. After Trinity’s relegation last season, UCD feature eight players on Leinster’s books, including four who featured in the province’s win over the Sharks in Durban last week, for their trek to Young Munster, who are again stacked with Munster players. Old Belvedere have won 1B while Nenagh Ormond have secured second, leaving Blackrock (51 points), Old Wesley (50) and UCC (48) fighting for the remaining two play-off spots. Blackrock host Old Wesley in Stradbrook, where the losers could miss out on the play-offs to UCC if they beat Old Belvedere at home. Last-placed Shannon (24 points) need a bonus-point win at home to Queen’s and hope that Highfield earn nothing from their trek to Naas if the nine-time champions are to avoid successive relegations. Trinity, at home to Nenagh, need to match Highfield’s result to avoid a relegation play-off. In the tussle for the last promotion play-off place in 2A, Corinthians, at home to Ballymena, trail fourth-placed Greystones, away to Navan, on points difference with their opponents fighting to avoid a relegation play-off. UL Bohs, Galwegians and Rainey are competing for the last play-off place in 2B, and face the relegation threatened duo of Sligo and Skerries as well as champions Wanderers. Midleton lead Enniscorthy atop 2C heading into final games away to Monkstown and Belfast Harlequins.

Gordon Chang, expert on U.S.-China relations, details how Beijing can 'make life very difficult' for firms involved in sale of Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is slated to meet with Panama leaders next week amid President Donald Trump's continued efforts to regain control of the key strategic and military resource. The Trump administration has been outspoken about national security threats presented by alleged Chinese interference. During a February visit to the country, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in an X post that "the United States cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed on Friday the secretary of defense will attend the 2025 Central American Security Conference, participating in discussions that will "drive ongoing efforts to strengthen the U.S.'s partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations," according to a report from the Associated Press. A cargo boat navigates on the Panama Canal next to the expansion project of the Panama Canal on the Pacific side in Panama City, November 17, 2015. (Reuters) PANAMA DENIES STATE DEPT CLAIM THAT IT IS ELIMINATING FEES FOR US GOV VESSELS USING CANAL The president, who has criticized the six-figure premiums imposed on U.S. ships traveling along the vital waterway, previously suggested repurchasing the canal. It was built by the U.S. over the span of multiple decades, but was eventually handed over to Panama during the Carter administration. The "Panama Canal Repurchase Act," a bill that was recently introduced in Congress, would give Trump the authority to negotiate with appropriate Panamanian government officials to reacquire the Panama Canal.

(Reuters/Yves Herman) CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK Panama President José Raúl Mulino previously said China does not have influence over the canal and accused Trump of "lying" about potentially acquiring it, according to the AP. BlackRock, Inc. later announced a $23 billion deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson to take ownership of the Panamanian ports of Cristobal and Balboa, along with 43 ports in 23 other countries, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Title: We just declared a trade war with the world

Time Published: 2025-04-04T22:34:17Z

Enjoy your tax hikes, I guess! by Elizabeth Lopatto Enjoy your tax hikes, I guess! by Elizabeth Lopatto Nice economy you have there, said President Donald Trump’s administration. It would be a shame if something happened to it. The something, announced earlier this week, is a set of globally applied tariffs that make no sense on their face. No sane economist would endorse this. Through a combination of stupidity, incompetence and sheer gangsterism, the Trump administration has decided to levy a series of taxes that encourage blatant corruption, entirely fail to encourage American manufacturing growth, and leave people and companies poorer. That is, assuming that the taxes come into play at all. “This is the craziest of the crazy things we’ve seen thus far.” The central, persistent thing Trump seems to misunderstand about tariffs is that they are paid in the US by people in the US. A reasonable person might also remember that he tried them a few years ago in a trade war, to negative effect. We have, as a nation, shot ourselves in the dick. But don’t take my word for it! Here are some actual experts: There are hints that these tariffs are the buffoonish products of actual clowns. Take the tariffs on uninhabited islands, perhaps part of a trade war on penguins. Or the tariffs on an island occupied primarily by… a US military base. Then there’s the math behind the tariffs, which uses a puzzling formula that is remarkably similar to what several chatbots spit back if asked. The official formulation uses fancy Greek letters that effectively cancel each other out. The Financial Times — a funnier European version of The Wall Street Journal — translated it into “the stupidest chart you’ll see today.” The US has shaken the world’s confidence, and there are consequences for that Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, doesn’t seem to know the answers to some basic tariff questions when he was asked about them, such as why Canada and Mexico were missing from Trump’s big nonsense tariff chart. Bessent also said he wasn’t part of the tariff negotiations with countries such as China, which is, frankly, weird. If the secretary of the treasury isn’t in the loop on tariff negotiations, uh, who is? The best-case scenario for all this, which still sucks, is that these tariffs — set to roll out in stages on April 5th and April 9th — will be abandoned. Trump has been threatening devastating tariffs on Mexico, Canada, or Colombia for months, only to back down at the first sign of resistance. Even the generally docile members of Congress are exhibiting signs of noticing this is a bad idea, and are at least paying lip service to restraining Trump’s power. But this frankly bizarre US vs. Everyone trade war could still be devastating to the US economy for years to come, even if the nonsense tariffs aren’t enacted. The US has shaken the world’s confidence, and there are consequences for that. Tariffs of any kind are disruptive. Since companies know they will be paying extra on items they import, they will pass the increase on to consumers, especially the poorest ones. They are likely to look for ways to cut costs and are unlikely to splash out on investments, says Meissner. Consumers are likely to do the same thing — cutting back on spending and holding onto necessities for longer than they would have otherwise, at least in part because they know there’s higher likelihood they’ll be fired if companies trim costs. Wages will likely remain the same, even as everything costs more The design of these new tariffs amplifies all of this. They’re global with a minimum tax of at least 10 percent, so companies can’t easily avoid them by moving supply chains around, like many did during Trump’s first trade war. And already we are seeing disruptions. The Nintendo Switch 2 has delayed preorders. Advertising businesses — like Meta, Google, and Amazon — are bracing for pullbacks on spending, especially from Chinese companies. Expect the price of groceries, clothes, and cars in particular to rise steeply. China has announced its retaliatory tariff, which will doubtless make those estimated price rises worse, and it may be the first of many countries to do so. These increases differ from the inflation that happened in the wake of COVID, Wolfers says. During that time, increased prices meant more money for companies, which could then be used to pay their employees more. But — because again, tariffs are a tax — this money will go straight to the Trump Administration. So wages will likely remain the same, even as everything costs more. Let’s talk for a hot minute about how the economy was doing pre-tariff. That dip in consumer confidence predated the latest tariff announcement. The actions of DOGE — firing and unfiring people, slashing social services, freezing previously-agreed-on grants, and generally running amok in the government — already shook consumers. In March, consumers’ expectations for the future were the lowest they’d been in more than a decade. In particular, people were nervous about their employment, which is the kind of thing that leads people to cut spending. A great deal of economics is basically just feelings. People are feeling bad, and the tariffs have them feeling worse. That’s the kind of thing that can spiral into a recession. JP Morgan’s macro economist had previously put the risk of a recession at about 40 percent. That’s not the only bank to do so — S&P Global, Goldman, Barclay’s, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank all agree that the risk is now considerably higher, though they disagree about how much higher. Those deals are “a way of making people beholden to you.” “The economy will perform worse with tariffs,” says Wolfers. That doesn’t necessarily mean a recession — it could simply mean slower growth — but nonetheless some economists, including Meissner, are expecting one. The ostensible reason behind these tariffs is to drive trade deficits to zero, but that makes no sense. A trade deficit essentially means that the US is receiving many goods and services from a country in exchange for pieces of paper, and they are receiving fewer goods and services (and thus giving us less paper), Wolfers says. Who cares? Economics isn’t a zero sum game. Many of our beautiful and brilliant Verge subscribers are in a trade deficit with The Verge, as they pay us $7 a month for our fine text products, and we buy zero dollars’ worth of things from them. Trump’s supposed ultimate goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, but this isn’t going to happen either. That requires a less uncertain environment so companies will invest in building here, for one thing. It also requires a workforce — and it’s unclear why Americans would choose to work in manufacturing jobs as long as they have other options. Pragmatically, there are two things that explain these idiotic taxes. The first is that the Trump Administration is run by fucking bozos whose main qualification for their job is that they are Donald Trump’s spineless yes-men. The second is that Trump himself is by temperament a gangster, and he’s looking for leverage over every country and business that deals with the US. For instance, domestic farmers have been trying, unsuccessfully thus far, to get exemptions to tariffs so they don’t get “economically drawn and quartered” buying more expensive equipment while selling less food abroad, as one farmer put it. Trump has indicated he’s open to making deals to lower tariffs on individual countries. Uncertainty around bribery and exemptions actually make this clown show worse Those deals are “a way of making people beholden to you,” says Barrett. “I’m torn on whether this is just not well-thought out, or whether the uncertainty is part of the design.” What might one have to do in order to get such an exemption? Well, Colombia, Canada and Mexico provide examples: make a silly concession that lets Trump declare victory while changing nothing of note. After all, Trump is addled by television to a degree that as long as something sounds good on Fox News, it’s a win for him. As for individual industries, we already have indications in the form of tech moguls’ generous donations, generous production deals for Trump family hagiographies, killing DEI programs to make conservative ideologues happy, and massive pro bono law firm deals. But that uncertainty around bribery and exemptions actually makes this clown show worse. The idea behind tariffs is that in the long term, it lets American companies more effectively compete by raising prices on foreign goods. That gives American-made goods a chance to raise their own prices as well, juicing profits. But for that to happen, companies have to invest in building things in America — and as previously mentioned, the uncertainty about how long any given tariffs may last is likely to lead to more of a wait-and-see approach. Which… kinda defeats the purpose. “We have undercut the good faith and standing of the government in the world’s eyes.” Markets don’t like uncertainty. Neither do trade partners. America is likely to be hit with reciprocal tariffs, including from our allies, increasing the country’s pain. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, famous to anyone who’s read Dave Barry Slept Here, introduced in 1930, are widely credited with worsening the Great Depression. The Trump tariffs are even bigger than those disastrous ones, based on nonsensical math that, for instance, hits an average EU tariff rate of about 2.7 percent with a “reciprocal” rate of 20 percent. The uncertainty also hurts the US politically. “We have undercut the good faith and standing of the government in the world’s eyes,” Barrett says. This undermines the dollar as a reserve currency for the world — one of its important functions for American political power, allowing us to borrow money more cheaply than most other countries. And indeed, the value of the dollar plummeted after the tariffs were announced — to a six-month low against the euro. The US’s bad behavior here is an incentive for people to move their money elsewhere. This is like watching a trainwreck in slow motion. Previously, the Trump administration weakened the dollar by announcing its crypto reserve. Musk unilaterally decided to tank our ability to work as the world’s R&D hub, attracting global talent and boosting our economy — and, additionally, taking an ax to American soft power in the process. Congress, which has chosen to abdicate control over spending, is effectively sidelined. Now the tariffs further endanger American wealth and safety. The only real questions are when we’re going to get the explosion, and how big it’ll be. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved

Sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Over the 13 years reporting on Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, I have watched the rise, fall, near misses, and rise again of the company and its billionaire leader. Musk, known for his willingness to take risks, has admitted how close the company came to filing for bankruptcy before turning it all around. It was that “us versus them” storyline that helped turn Musk into a symbol of innovation. His political alignment with President Trump, and more importantly, his activities as the unofficial leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, has changed public perception of Musk. But it’s Tesla that is taking the biggest hit, including a drop in Q1 sales, global Tesla Takedown protests, and a falling stock price. And automakers, which have long trailed Tesla in EV sales, are taking advantage of this opening by offering sweet trade-in deals and other incentives. Senior reporter Rebecca Bellan has documented the moments over the past several months that have affected Tesla. Her article will be periodically updated, so be sure to check back. Can Tesla rebound? The recent tariffs announced by Trump could help Tesla since its vehicles — and many of its components — are made here in the United States. It still might not be enough protection to stop the bleeding. And tariffs will likely hurt Tesla’s energy-storage business. The chaos surrounding the tariffs implemented by Trump will linger. We’re just starting to see how automakers are reacting and adjusting. Some, like Ford, are trying to get ahead and provide discounts to boost sales in the short term. And Volkswagen has told dealerships it plans to add an import fee to the price of imported cars sold in the United States, per The New York Times. A little bird told us that while Tesla definitely appears poised to launch a robotaxi service in Austin this summer, the automaker’s outreach to the city has been slim. Others like Waymo and Cruise (back when Cruise was a thing) have tried to get off on the right foot by connecting with as many city stakeholders as possible before launching. Some government officials also shared safety concerns around Tesla’s brand of autonomy. They worry Tesla’s cars might have a more limited awareness of surroundings since they only rely on cameras, rather than lidar and radar, for perception. Got a tip for us?

EVident Battery, a Massachusetts-based advanced battery inspection tech startup, raised $3.2 million in a seed funding round led by Ibex Investors. Nationwide Ventures, Automotive Ventures, and Avesta Fund also joined. Fourier, the hydrogen startup, raised $18.5 million in a Series A round led by General Catalyst and Paramark Ventures. Other participating investors include Airbus Ventures, Borusan Ventures, GSBackers, MCJ Collective, and Positive Ventures. Windrose Technology, an EV maker based in Belgium and with Chinese roots, plans to file for an IPO in the U.S. to $400 million, The New York Times reported. TechCrunch reporter Maxwell Zeff interviewed San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and autonomous vehicles do come up. Check out the video here. Uber has partnered with Dubai’s Road and Transport Authority in a deal that paves the way for the company to operate AVs in the United Arab Emirates city. Uber doesn’t have its own AVs, so it will rely on partnerships. Its first in Dubai will be with Chinese company WeRide. Speaking of WeRide, the AV company has obtained a driverless public road testing and operating permit in France. Harbinger, a medium-duty EV manufacturer, officially started production and has manufactured its first 100 salable units, the company told TechCrunch. It’s a notable milestone for the California-based startup, which was founded in 2021. Those vehicles will be headed to several customers, including RV giant Thor Industries. Meanwhile, Harbinger has also inserted itself into the bankruptcy proceedings of EV startup Canoo. Harbinger filed an objection to the sale of Canoo’s assets to its CEO, potentially throwing a wrench into the 2-month-old bankruptcy case. Rivian delivered just 8,640 vehicles in the first three months of 2025, the company’s worst quarterly mark since the end of 2022. The company says it still expects to deliver between 46,000 and 51,000 EVs by the end of 2025. Redwood Materials, the battery materials and recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, opened a research and development center in San Francisco. The 15,000-square-foot facility located in the city’s Design District is equipped with lab space to support engineers who will eventually work on every point of the battery ecosystem, from chemical engineering and cathode science to software and electrical engineering.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: I built a 'tariff pantry' for my family. These are my top 4 hacks.

Time Published: 2025-04-04T19:02:37Z
Full Content:
Whether you've seen Mark Cuban's advice to go to Walmart and buy "lots of consumables" before prices increase or how some Americans are already stockpiling goods, you may be wondering whether to prepare for the potential impact of upcoming tariffs on your family We have been bracing for rising costs since the election results came in. My husband and I have spent the last four months building what we started calling our "tariff pantry." If the prices of groceries and household necessities continue to rise, and our paychecks remain the same, it will bust our budget It's time to get creative. It's always been important for us to keep an emergency reserve of food on hand in case of a natural disaster, as we live in Indiana with power outages in the winter and tornadoes in the spring. Starting in November 2024, our family and several of our friends decided it was time to take that a bit further. We started building "tariff pantries." Assuming tariffs raise prices, we will have a good reserve of food and household supplies on hand to fall back on. The right amount to have on hand varies from household to household. Some friends are stocking up on emergency rations in case of major disruptions, but others are just keeping an extra week or two of groceries in the house. Here's my approach: If I can have a pantry full of groceries and household supplies now, then I can save money later when costs have increased. If milk skyrockets in price, I can still buy it but keep my overall spending low if I already have other essentials at home. I've used some basic calorie calculations (2000 calories per adult per day) to set aside five to six weeks of food. Although my approach is to use this pantry to supplement my groceries, not as our sole source of food, having several weeks on hand seemed like a good way to calculate our options. It's tempting to run to Costco and buy everything I see, just in case we need it later. But that's not actually going to create any savings; if I load up a credit card with expenses I can't immediately pay off, I'm adding to my expenses, not saving anything. That's why I've set up four rules for quickly building my food reserves. 1. Buy what you can afford. This means your pantry, like mine, may not be stocked as quickly as someone else's, or with as much food. But a small emergency supply is better than none at all. Account for food storage needs, like mylar bags, mouse-proof plastic containers, and 5-gallon buckets. 2. The clearance aisle is your friend. Instead of trying to master the art of couponing, I'm focused on finding clearance and sale items. I buy a little bit extra every time I go to the grocery store. Look for foods with a long shelf life and a distant expiration date. Speaking of expiration dates, things that are about to expire aren't always the best for a long-term pantry. However, you can get household items like toothbrushes, shampoo, and cleaning supplies from the clearance section that have no expiration dates. Apps like Flashfood can give you access to clearance-priced grocery store produce, meat, and dairy that is about to reach its "use by" date. If you have freezer space, you can purchase and freeze these items for long-term use. I've added quite a bit of meat to my deep freezer using this method. Use this Food Safety Chart to learn the best timeframe for freezing foods safely. 3. Think beyond the grocery store. I'm committed to having a garden again this year. I've often had a hobby garden that costs more than it helps me save, but my garden has to work harder this year. To save costs, I'm starting plants from seeds instead of buying established plants later in the season---I've already started vegetables in peat pots indoors. Consider what resources may be available in your area. For example, a local Amish grocery store near us often has great prices on seasonings, jams, baking supplies, and canning supplies. Some items, like bulk products from Costco or local suppliers, can be shared with friends. A good friend of mine doesn't have the space or time to garden this year, so she's arranging to trade some of her skills for extra produce from friends' gardens. 4. Remember Covid-era lessons. I find myself thinking back to those early pandemic days lately. When we suddenly had to stop going to the grocery store, we learned a lot of lessons about what to have on hand. This isn't an opportunity to practice over-consumption or hoarding — rather, it's a time to be intentional about what we have in stock. For example, don't buy things because you think you might start baking bread or cooking beans from scratch and changing everything about the way you eat. Also, focus on what your family eats, not what others add to their pantry. In our family, the point of a tariff pantry is to create a buffer between our spending and the impact of tariffs. By responsibly storing food based on what we actually need and can afford, we're keeping our costs down. More importantly, we're giving ourselves some peace of mind at a time when we have little control. Jump to

Retail investors are trying to time the market and take advantage of the multi trillion-dollar market meltdown triggered by Trump’s new tariffs. A new note to clients from JPMorgan Chase says mainstreet investors poured $4.7 billion into stocks on Thursday, representing the largest collective allocation in 10 years, reports Reuters. Retail is primarily buying small-cap technology stocks in its attempt to buy the dip – a sector that institutional investors have increasingly bet against. Retail investors are also focusing on Mag 7 stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN), although they are net sellers of Tesla (TSLA). More than $5 trillion has been wiped out of US markets in the past two days amid President Trump’s massive tariff hikes, which have sparked fears of a global trade war and an impending economic downturn. Today at time of publishing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1,602 points, representing a 3.9% drop, with the S&P 500 down 244 points for a 4.5% decline.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: Chips mostly dodged Trump's tariffs, but that could soon change

When President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs this week that sent global markets into a panic, a few exemptions were made, including for semiconductors. In addition to the country-by-country reciprocal tariffs, including 34% for China and 32% for Taiwan, Trump introduced a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on imports from all other countries. However, the White House said some goods, such as steel and auto parts already subject to tariffs, and energy and minerals not available in the U.S., are not subject to the reciprocal tariffs. While semiconductors are also on this list, Jefferies (JEF-1.01%) analysts said in a note on Friday that “this is because President Trump is considering additional sector-specific tariffs on those items.” And although it’s not a direct impact yet, the tariffs will still “have significant ramifications on end demand for” the electronics and devices that semiconductors are inside of, the analysts said, because the prices for those items will climb. Jefferies expects the tariffs to continue pressuring chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA+1.42%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.97%), Broadcom (AVGO+3.26%), and Marvell (MRVL+0.83%), “which all purchase the majority of their chips from TSMC (TSM-1.49%)” in Taiwan. The analysts also expect stock pressure for companies that have end markets that rely on the Chinese supply chain, namely Apple (AAPL-2.62%). “[W]e expect there to be more Semis restrictions/tariffs coming up given concerns over national security which are elevated for this administration,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that they “see potential for further export restrictions” in addition to chip-specific tariffs. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported last week that foreign government officials and tech company leaders are asking the Trump administration to relax some rules under the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, which aims to control which countries, including U.S. allies, can import advanced semiconductors needed for AI development. Known as the AI diffusion rule, the framework puts countries into three different tiers, and outlines how many chips countries can import, where the chips can be deployed, and how nations can work together on AI. The rules came out at the tail end of the Biden administration. With the May 15 deadline to be in compliance looming, foreign governments and tech companies reportedly want the Trump administration to rethink some restrictions out of worries that the rules could hamper AI development and investment.

Title: Warren Buffet's market wisdom when stocks fall is all in this 19th century poem

This week, President Donald Trump’s new tariffs sent shockwaves through the stock market, triggering a sharp sell-off as investors reacted to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,400 points, marking one of its steepest declines in years. As the Magnificent 7 tech stocks – Amazon (AMZN-1.06%), Apple, and Tesla (TSLA-2.17%) among them – slid, concerns about price increases and supply chain disruptions began to grow. In times like these, many investors look for guidance when the market turns volatile. Warren Buffet, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+1.63%), has some advice when market declines occur: Stay calm and avoid panic. In his 2017 shareholder letter, Buffet stressed the importance of sticking to a long-term strategy, regardless of how volatile the market becomes. “When major declines occur ... that’s the time to heed these lines,” Buffet noted, pointing to Rudyard Kipling’s 19th century poem “If–.” “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . . If you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . . If you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . . If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you... Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.” Buffet added that the market will always experience ups and down, and investing involves the risk that the expected objective won’t always be attained. “The light can go from green to red without pausing at yellow,” he said. Those who stay financially secure and patient during downturns are the ones who ultimately emerge stronger, he added. As Trump’s tariffs continue to rattle markets, create uncertainty, and spark volatility, Buffet’s advice is more relevant than ever. The legendary investor has previously likened the tariffs to “an act of war,” partly because “the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ‘em!” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Should We Talk About The Weather? Should We Talk About The Government?

Time Published: 2025-04-04T16:31:27Z

Severe storms this week have caused tornadoes, high winds, and flooding across large parts of the country since Wednesday, killing a least seven people so far, with more storms expected in the Midwest and Southeast in the next few days. The wave of storms comes as the National Weather Service (NWS) is coping with huge job losses thanks to Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s war on government agencies, especially the ones that deal with climate change, which Trumpers consider a made-up “religious” belief that can be safely ignored. The current storms follow another heavy storm system in March that killed at least 39 in tornadoes, high winds, and wildfires. The weather service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has lost at least 2,000 workers between firings, layoffs of “provisional” employees, and people taking/being pushed to take buyouts, leading to about 20 percent fewer staff dealing with the same amount of weather, which the administration has been unable to cut. In addition to the staff cuts, NOAA will shut down a number of its research division’s websites because its contracts with web services providers have been cancelled, according to Bloomberg News (gift link). As a result, almost all external websites reliant on Amazon, Google and WordPress services are poised to vanish early Saturday morning in Washington, wiping the bulk of the unit’s work, which includes climate and environmental science research, from public view. Sure, that sounds bad, but you probably didn’t visit those sites anyway, so you won’t even notice they’re gone. You’d certainly notice if Wonkette were gone, so we need you to become a paid subscriber if you can! If you already are, you rock! Scientists have been warning that the mass firings will harm weather forecasting and endanger the public, especially as hurricane season approaches. Of course, it’s extremely difficult to prove any links between the staff cuts and potential loss of life due to extreme weather, which kills people no matter how good the forecasts are. But any loss of lead time in warning the public, especially in the case of tornadoes, will make it harder for people to take shelter. Already this week, the National Weather Service office in Louisville, Kentucky, announced that because of staffing shortages, it wouldn’t be able to send teams out to survey the damage from tornadoes that hit the area Wednesday, at least not until after currently forecast storms have cleared, probably near the end of this weekend. In the meantime, the office asked members of the public to send the office photos of storm damage. NWS Louisville meteorologist Brian Neudorff explained that such crowdsourced photos would help the office “evaluate the damage and it will allow us to plan on where we need to go once we have the available staff to survey.” Local TV station WAVE also very responsibly reported that the Weather Service announcement didn’t directly link the staffing issues to the mass shitcannings at NOAA, instead leaving the audience to put two and two together. The staffing cuts have also forced multiple NWS locations to cut weather balloon launches from twice daily to just one a day. Some locations will halt balloon launches altogether, presumably because some other launch site is close enough for diminished government work. Not huge cuts — yet — just reductions or suspensions of balloon launches at 11 sites so far, a tenth of those that had been in use. The NWS uses these weather balloons, until recently launched twice per day from 100 total locations, to gather temperature, wind, pressure and other data from the ground up to approximately 100,000 feet. The results are compiled along with data from satellites, radar stations, surface weather stations, buoys and aircraft to build weather models and forecasts that are public and freely available. Former NOAA weather data boffin Michael Morgan, now an atmospheric science professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the reduced data may not be critical just yet, but it will make a difference to forecasts’ overall accuracy and timeliness: “We’re going to lose data because of this staffing,” Morgan said in a press conference Monday. “And that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast. “Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor? No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.” Alan Sealls, the president-elect of the American Meteorological Society, offered a more striking metaphor, comparing losing some weather balloon data to knocking a few bolts here and there out of the steel frame for an office tower: “Nobody can say how many bolts you can leave out or remove before the structural integrity is compromised.” We hasten to point out that this is indeed just a metaphor, and not an accusation that weather balloons did 9/11. The tragic thing here is that improvements in weather forecasting have led to significantly fewer deaths from extreme weather in the US and around the world. That’s primarily because forecasters have been able to give the public greater lead time in warning of conditions that will spawn tornadoes, as well as more accurate forecasts of the track of hurricanes, interventions by presidential Sharpie notwithstanding. Former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told CNN the staffing cuts will definitely lead to a decline in reliability of forecasts: “Any reduction in staffing at a weather forecast office will result in either delays in the forecast being issued, and watches and warnings as well, or an erosion of quality. […] It wouldn’t surprise me at all if at the end of the season we’ve gone back by a few years – maybe a decade – in terms of capability.” Spinrad led NOAA during the Biden administration, however, so we’re certain that the seasoned science experts on Twitter will explain that forecasts were good enough a decade ago, and that government scientists have only themselves to blame for losing their jobs because they kept saying climate change was real, even though that’s now illegal, and besides, now that Florida is preparing to outlaw “weather manipulation,” the number of deadly storms will definitely go down, so there. Yes, kids, we’re now going to enter a new age of stupid online arguments. It’ll be a bit like climate change. We know a warmer atmosphere is causing more extreme weather events, but it remains hard to attribute any particular storm’s effects to a warming climate. In some cases, like the heavier rainfall, greater storm surge, and rapid increase in severity of hurricanes in recent years, the connections are quite clear: Warmer air can hold far more moisture, warmer water expands, and higher ocean temperatures provide hurricanes a lot more energy to grow quickly. But tornadoes are such short-lived events, dependent on lots of variables, that the exact connections are still difficult to determine. Similarly, as Spinrad and others make clear, staffing cuts in the NWS will enshittify forecasts overall, and it’s only logical to expect crappier forecasts will leave the public with less ability to prepare for or escape storms. But unless reduced staff causes some really glaring bit of information to go missing, it’ll be very hard to connect the job cuts to particular storm losses. We forecast dangerous levels of gaslighting on all this. Share [AP / PBS Newshour / CNN / WAVE-TV / Inside Climate News / Bloomberg (gift link)] Yr Wonkette is funded entirely by reader donations.

Hello, I'm Sorry, I Lost Myself My first ladyfriend in college was Romanian, and she was fascinated by American tornadoes. When I asked why, she said that pretty much nowhere else in the world has them nearly as often. She was right: the US experiences 75% of the world's yearly reported tornadoes, and Europe sees barely any at all (only Russia has any significant number of them, and those are usually way the fuck out in steppe country where no one lives).

Title: We asked BI's newsroom who is spending ahead of tariffs — and who is holding off

Let's get this out of the way from the jump — it's always best to avoid panic-buying and be strategic when making purchases. But to get a sense of how people are weighing their spending right now, we asked reporters and editors across BI's newsroom to tell us what they're choosing to purchase right now — or why they're holding off — ahead of Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs. For some, potential price hikes on consumer electronics out of China were the tipping point to pull the trigger on a gadget. Others purchased some extra daily consumables or said they were considering a similar move. And some said their spending habits remain unchanged. Let's dive in: Chief correspondent Peter Kafka: On Thursday, instead of checking out my 401(k), I bought a new MacBook Air from Apple, on their website. I have an Apple Card, so I was able to finance it at 0% APR. It's possible Tim Cook will figure out how to get Donald Trump to exempt Apple from tariffs like he did the first time around. Maybe he won't. But either way my kid will need a new computer in the next few months, so I figured I should get one now. I don't know when I'll look at my 401(k), though. Editor Conz Preti: My husband and I are also stocking up on shelf-stable foods. With three kids who rip through food every week, we are keeping our pantry stocked with pasta, canned food, and baking supplies. For veggies, we are planting as much as we can (tomatoes, kale, lettuce, cucumber, peas, carrots) in our garden to offset some costs of things we can't grow, like berries and bananas that our kids love. Trending reporter Ana Altchek: I will be taking a wait-and-see approach. I don't think it's possible to fully predict the market and prepare for possible price hikes — who knows how individual companies will be impacted and how they'll choose to respond? I definitely don't want to overspend in preparation for something that may or may not happen. Plus, I'd rather pay a little extra for some items I know I need in six months than overspend right now on items I may need. Real estate reporter Alcynna Lloyd: I wear hair extensions and ordered some in case tariffs drive up prices or items stop shipping as they did during COVID-19. The wig and extension industry relies heavily on suppliers from China and other Asia-based countries, and during the pandemic, it was a nightmare to get products. Editor Steven Tweedie: I'm ordering larger bags of cat food than I normally would since I know I'll go through it all, and it'll keep. Otherwise, I'm doing my best to resist using this as an excuse to spend on something I don't actually need, like a new Nvidia Graphics card for my PC — even though I'm guessing I'll end up spending more a year or two from now when I finally do upgrade. Senior retail reporter Alex Bitter: I bought a new trench-digging shovel (made in China) on Thursday and will probably pick up another this weekend. I use them for metal detecting and want a spare or two in case one breaks. In general, though, I'm not stocking up on much. These tariffs cover so many products that it seems like avoiding them entirely will be impossible, especially in the long run. Editor Andy Kiersz: I bought a new gaming laptop in December. I'd been considering upgrading at some point but had originally planned to do so later in 2025. The election and subsequent threat of tariffs spurred the move. I'm actually now somewhat regretting not also replacing my still-functional but definitely showing-its-age iPhone 11. Senior correspondent Katie Notopoulos: On Tuesday evening, I did a last-minute shop for things I thought would be most obviously sensitive to the tariffs — cheap fast-fashion clothing made overseas. I hit up the H&M near the BI office for three polyester shirts and a pack of socks. I placed the Old Navy order that I've had in my cart for two weeks for kids' swimsuits and summer clothes. Finally, in a last moment of panic and extreme dopamine low, I went onto Temu and ordered a few cheap toys for a kid's upcoming birthday. On Wednesday, talking with coworkers about how they had bought new laptops and TVs, a flash of Bad Ideas went through my mind. Did I need a new phone? (No, my iPhone 14 is working just fine.) Computer? (No, mine is working fine.) Surely, electronics will go up in price — perhaps now is the time to get a new Kindle? (No. Stop!) Editor Brad Davis: I'm not buying anything special — and I won't! Will my stubbornness come back to bite me, like when I refused to stock up on masks in March 2020? (I really wished I had bought those masks by April of that year.) Editor Ashley Rodriguez: I'm thinking about stocking up on diapers and wipes. My Costco stashes on both are running low. It's a tough decision because my 7-month-old has been growing so quickly that I worry she'll outgrow the diapers before I have a chance to use them all. Reporter Alice Tecotzky: As a devoted baker, I bought an extra bottle of vanilla Thursday despite still having some left in my pantry. Much of our vanilla comes from Madagascar, which was hit with a 47% tariff, and I anticipate the already pricey product will only get more expensive (and derail my long-awaited summer baking plans). Other than that, I'm not stockpiling too much, both because the economic future seems impossible to predict and because I don't have space in my small Brooklyn apartment. Editor Monica Melton: When my 2020 HP laptop gave up the ghost in February, I promptly handed it over to an e-waste recycling program. Since then, I've been borrowing my husband's MacBook Pro, telling myself I'd do research on the specs and best deal for my next personal computer. While this has taken me months to get around to, given how tariffs will impact the price of consumer electronics, I feel a renewed urgency to get that laptop this weekend. I'll likely choose a refurbished MacBook, which I reckon would hold up better than another HP. The resale market for electronics is looking a lot more appealing these days! Senior correspondent Emily Stewart: I am … not buying anything. Not because I'm not worried about tariffs! But honestly, I do not need anything right now, and I'm trying to fight my consumerist, "What should I buy about this?" tendencies. Obviously, price increases are bad. But I don't think it's bad to take a beat and think about whether I actually need to be drowning in even more stuff, especially as I stare at the robot vacuum I panic-bought during the pandemic that I have used a handful of times and is now broken. Editor Paige DiFiore: Earlier this week, we replaced our dying air fryer — it might've lasted us a few more months but we'd rather buy a new one now before prices could go up. Now, I'm stocking up on household essentials that won't expire, like toilet paper, dishwasher pods, and laundry detergent at BJ's. My fiancé and are I big coffee drinkers, so we just ordered some bags of espresso from our favorite Italian brand — but we can't buy too much because its shelf life is only a few months. I'm very concerned about how expensive coffee could get since it's not something the US produces on a large scale. We're getting married this year, so I'm relieved most of my guests purchased bridal shower gifts before the tariffs were announced. I'd feel bad if items on the list, like small appliances, cost even more than they already do. Editor Leena Rao: On Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the tariffs were announced, my husband went to the Apple Store and bought a new iPhone 16 Pro and a MacBook Pro. These weren't time-sensitive purchases, but given the potential rise in costs of hardware, we wanted to preempt any price increases. We are in the process of leasing a new car (a Volvo) and have one on order that's supposed to arrive in the next two weeks. I don't believe the model of our car is made in the United States. I'm hopeful we won't incur any additional costs for our monthly lease price, but we won't find out until the car arrives and we officially sign the paperwork for the lease. Editor Debbie Strong: I replaced my dishwasher last week and splurged on a slightly fancier model. The motor had broken on our old one, so this was less of a "tariff panic" purchase and more of an "I refuse to hand-wash another dish" emergency buy. Still, I'm relieved at the timing, as dishwashers have been repeatedly flagged as an item about to get way more expensive. I don't have any other plans to stock up on goods, mainly because I don't have the headspace for it right now. We'll see if that changes next time I'm at the grocery store. Jump to

Title: Trump tanks tech, Intel and TSMC do a deal, and OpenAI sets a fundraising record

UPDATED 11:57 EDT / APRIL 04 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Trump’s high tariffs, imposed late Wednesday, somehow managed to surprise investors, as tech stocks, and just about all stocks along with our 401(k)s, tanked Thursday and looked to be on an even steeper fall Friday — and many observers think even now the market isn’t pricing in the full impact. It’s hard to see how all this doesn’t drive us into a recession, and even harder to see why Trump is doing it. There’s no 3D chess here, only a checkerboard kicked onto the floor by a petty, malignant narcissist. (Ask me what I really think.) Meanwhile, it looks like those tariffs and the market meltdown have put the kibosh on planned initial public offerings, such as Klarna and StubHub. Stablecoin provider Circle finally filed to go public, but it will be interesting to see how soon that will happen now. Only sort-of bright spot: CoreWeave’s seeming dud looks a little better as its stock rose well above its initial price and remains there. Intel and TSMC have reached a preliminary deal for a joint venture to operate Intel’s chip factories, with TSMC taking a 20% stake. But how helpful this will be to Intel, and by extension U.S. chip manufacturing, depends on the details, which are sparse at this point. Elsewhere on the chip front, Qualcomm is getting more acquisitive, looking at buying chipmaker Alphawave, on top of buying Vietnamese artificial intelligence research group MovianAI earlier this week and Edge Impulse last month. OpenAI raised a ridiculous amount of money, a record-setting $40 billion — so much that it utterly skewed the latest venture capital stats. As capable as the company is, a valuation of $300 billion leaves absolutely no room for error, even if the errors aren’t its own. Indeed, Trump’s tariffs could slow down AI growth by making data center components more expensive, and already Alibaba and Microsoft are slowing their data center spending. Yet the AI funding keeps on coming: Alphabet spinout Isomorphic Labs also bagged $600 million and Runway AI $308 million. One rather concerning observation on generative AI from a new Gartner report: “Consumers are not chasing these features. As the manufacturers embed AI as a standard feature in consumer devices, consumers will be forced to purchase them.” Hmm. But AI is about to reset the cybersecurity industry, as Dave and Zeus outlined in the latest Breaking Analysis. And sure enough, a new study shows AI is now outperforming human red teams. Moreover, investors and cyber companies are betting on the reset, as ReliaQuest raised $500 million and Cyberhaven snagged $100 million for their AI-driven cyber tools, and others such as Solarwinds and Exabeam upped their AI games. The TikTok drama drags on as Trump said he would sign an executive order to extend the ban by 75 days. Here’s the news from this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: OpenAI bags $40B in funding, increasing its post-money valuation to $300B Siemens to buy life sciences R&D company Dotmatics for $5.1B Alphabet spinout Isomorphic Labs raises $600M for its AI drug design engine AI video generation startup Runway raises $308M round backed by Nvidia Gartner forecasts worldwide generative AI spending to reach $644B in 2025 Interesting quote from Distinguished VP Analyst John-David Lovelock, building on the forecast that 80% of that spending will be on hardware such as servers, smartphones and PCs: “Consumers are not chasing these features. As the manufacturers embed AI as a standard feature in consumer devices, consumers will be forced to purchase them.” Microsoft scales back global AI data center expansion plans amid emerging low-cost model trends Global VC funding hits $113 billion in first quarter, driven by outsized AI deals Data management startup Hydrolix reels in $80M Qualcomm acquires MovianAI to bolster its AI capabilities Unframe launches with $50M in funding to offer outcome-based AI solutions for businesses DevOps startup Opsera raises $20M to accelerate software delivery with AI agents Sourcetable gets $4.3M in funding to help everyone become a spreadsheet power user AutonomyAI launches with $4M to build front-end development AI agents FurtherAI gets $4M in funding to further AI automation in the insurance sector Vallor raises $4M to advance AI automation for enterprise procurement To its credit, Google is keeping the focus on AI safety as artificial general intelligence looms, with a new paper outlining more clearly what the actual risks are — four of them, in fact: Google DeepMind outlines safety framework for future AGI development OpenAI to launch its first ‘open-weights’ model since 2019 Exclusive: Panzura unlocks metadata from IBM Deep Archive files for AI training Amazon introduces Nova Act, an AI agent that can use a web browser AWS brings its generative AI assistant to the Amazon OpenSearch Service Kong’s updated AI Gateway helps to secure AI model production deployments Emergence AI is using AI agents to build new AI agents in real-time Cognition AI launches revamped coding assistant Devin 2.0 with much lower starting price Runway launches new Gen-4 AI video generator French startup Gladia launches next-generation multilingual speech-to-text AI model Solaria Oumi releases small-parameter hallucination detection model to open source There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Trump tanks tech titans (and ultimately almost everyone else): Tech stocks slump after Trump announces ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs Report: TSMC tentatively agrees to establish chipmaking joint venture with Intel Agents, DeepSeek and MCP: Kubernetes adapts to the brave new world of AI KubeCon day 1 keynote analysis: Taming multicloud complexity with cloud-native observability and automation Anything else that isn’t directly sponsored?

Title: Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks Fall as Tariff-Fueled Rout Continues

The chips are down. Chip stocks fell Friday, losing ground on the second trading day after President Donald Trump unveiled a set of global tariffs that sent stock markets dramatically lower—and the first since China announced its own retaliatory measures. The latest news offered investors yet another indication that trade war is here to stay, at least for now. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX), which tracks chip shares, was recently down about 7%. Four of its components, namely Marvell Technology (MRVL), Coherent (COHR), Entegris (ENTG) and Micron Technology (MU), were recently off more than 7% apiece. “Because many finished electronics goods and IT infrastructure goods are ultimately imported from many of [the countries affected by the new tariffs],” UBS analysts wrote Thursday, “this could have a profound negative impact on electronics demand.” Nvidia (NVDA), one of last year’s stock-market darlings, was off more than 7% in recent trading. Citi analysts yesterday suggested that analog chipmakers like Analog Devices (ADI) could outperform the broader sector in a downturn; its shares were off some 6% in recent trading. This week’s tariff announcements have hit stocks broadly. Today, all three major indexes were recently down roughly 4%, with the blue-chip Dow faring only a bit better. All 11 of the S&P 500’s sectors were recently in decline; its semiconductor and equipment subindex was down about 7%. China’s new tariffs on US imports are set to take effect Thursday, according to that country’s finance ministry.

The Nasdaq Composite was on track to fall into a bear market on Friday as the tariff-induced global stock sell-off deepened. The Nasdaq was recently down nearly 4% Friday morning, putting the index more than 20% off its December all-time high. The tech-heavy index was sliding alongside the other major large-cap indexes, with the S&P 500 off about 4% and the Dow down about 3.5%. The Nasdaq will have to close below 16,139.11 for a bear market to be confirmed. The index was recently trading at 15876 after rebounding from its session low below of 15600. The Nasdaq on Thursday had its worst day since March 2020 after President Donald Trump outlined a raft of steep tariffs that economists warn risk pushing the U.S. economy into a recession while stoking inflation. The sell-off continued Friday after China hit back with its own tariff on all US goods, matching the rate on Chinese goods announced by Trump. The move raised concerns that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs could be the beginning of a global trade war that results in even higher tariffs than those already announced. The majority of the more than 3,000 stocks in the Nasdaq were trading in the red on Friday, but mega-cap tech stocks were weighing most heavily on the index. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were down more than 4% after tumbling nearly 10% yesterday, their worst day since March 2020. AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were both down more than 7%, while EV maker Tesla (TSLA) tumbled nearly 10%,

Also: White House may let China keep TikTok algo control; egg lobby aims to silence critics ahead of annual Easter egg roll. Brands and consumers are reacting to the volatile trade war escalating around the world. “Today is an across-the-board disruption of the American economy, so anything with consumer exposure is getting creamed,” Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research, told the New York Times. In response, various brands and entire industries have wasted little time vocalizing the potential pain the duties will do to their business. Wine producers in France, for instance, have expressed concerns after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff. The Bourgogne Wine Board said that the U.S. is critical to the region’s wine sales, with the tariffs potentially costing Burgundy wines up to 100 million euros, according to the Associated Press. French winemaker Vincent Dampt told the AP that the tariffs were “bad news,” though he acknowledged it could have been worse. “I was really stressed with the possibility of having this 200% tariff,” he said, referring to the threat of even higher tariffs made earlier in the trade dispute between the U.S. and the European Union. Dampt noted that the tariffs will likely require slashing prices for the U.S. market. Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs dealt a major blow to the tech sector, making it one of the hardest-hit industries. Major technology firms, including Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, lost nearly $1 trillion in market value, making it one of the sector’s worst days since the pandemic, the Times reported. While most companies have remained quiet in response, some spoke up, including Ford which launched a campaign in response to the new 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts. As part of this initiative, Ford is offering U.S. customers the same pricing that its employees receive for vehicles. Why it matters: The Wall Street Journal that the tariff moves and corresponding market shake-ups have resulted in American consumers rushing out to purchase goods in sectors across the board – from yoga pants and TVs to automobiles. While others suspect that other big-scale items, like cars, may suffer major sales slumps. As a result, PR teams need to be particularly strategic with their approaches. They can’t overreach or risk alienating the White House, but they need to find ways to connect with consumers amid this market uncertainty. Ford, for example, is using a very pro-U.S. mantra as part of its campaign messaging: “From America. For America.” The promotion is on display at the top of the company website and across its social channels. The campaign also includes a TV spot voiced by actor Bryan Cranston, where he introduces the campaign as “an unprecedented moment in automotive history,” drawing attention to Ford’s significant U.S. operations. The campaign aims to get ahead of likely price increases, according to Rob Kaffl, Ford’s director of U.S. sales and dealer relations. “We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans. Whether it’s navigating the complexities of a changing economy or simply needing a reliable vehicle for your family, we want to help,” Kaffl told The Drum. For PR teams, Ford’s approach provides an example of how to address potential consumer concerns with clear, direct messaging that emphasizes company values without alienating other key stakeholders. But this also can only work for companies with certain supply chains with strong American roots and pricing flexibility – others will have to get more creative. Other industries aren’t so lucky, though. Technology companies have been in the crosshairs of the White House, the EU and even China so they understandably aren’t in a hurry to be overly vocal about the subject. Instead, they’re allowing analysts to do a lot of the talking for them. It’s a long-game play, Kramer said. Apple has already finalized its manufacturing plans for 2026, so it can’t avoid tariffs until at least 2027, he said. “You cannot re-architect your supply chain in a quarter,” Kramer said.

Title: The Magnificent 7 stocks slide again and the Dow drops 1,100 points as China retaliates in trade war

The Magnificent 7 tech stocks plunged, leading the overall market lower for a second day, after Jerome Powell warned about the effect of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, but said the Federal Reserve won’t race to cut interest rates. “It’s now becoming clear tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” the Fed chair said at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing conference. Stocks extended their declines after Powell spoke on Friday. The S&P 500 index ended the day down almost 6%, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 5.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 2,231 points, or 5.5%. Stocks had their worst day in five years on Thursday, and then did so again on Friday. Nvidia (NVDA+1.18%) and Apple (AAPL-3.08%) each dropped about 7.3%. Declines in the other Mag 7 stocks were 5% for Meta (META-0.03%), 4.1% for Amazon (AMZN-1.06%), 10.4% for Tesla (TSLA-2.17%), 3.5% for Microsoft (MSFT+0.50%), and 3.2% for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-0.18%). Energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM-1.49%), Chevron (CVX-1.33%), and ConocoPhillips (COP-2.42%), plunged on recession fears. Powell said the size and duration of the tariff effects are uncertain and that policymakers “don’t need to be in a hurry” to make decisions on monetary policy, he added. “We’re going to need to wait and see how this plays out.” Trump, via Truth Social, again called on Powell to cut rates and accused the studiously neutral Fed chair of playing politics. He’d earlier said via social media that his “POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE” after insisting on Thursday that “it’s going very well” and that “the markets are going to boom.” Nonetheless, Nike led a rebound in some shoe and garment makers’ shares, gaining 4.3% midday, after Trump said that he’d held a “very productive call” with Vietnam’s leader and that trade talks were possible. The shoemaker, which sources about half its production in the Southeast Asian country, was up 3% at market close. Earlier on Friday, Beijing imposed imposed 34% tariffs on all American goods, matching Trump’s duties, and took other measures, including restricting exports of some rare earth materials and barring some U.S. companies from doing business in China. The EU has yet to announce any retaliation. Additionally, employers added 228,000 jobs in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, rising from a downwardly revised 117,000 in February and beating the average estimate of 130,000. The jobless rate nonetheless increased to 4.2% from 4.1%, and hourly wages increased 0.30%, both matching projections. The better-than-expected jobs numbers for March are relics of a bygone era in the U.S. economy and won’t stand in the way of the Fed cutting interest rates later this year, economists said. “Mounting uncertainty and consequential investment paralysis will likely lead them to an easing bias in the second half of 2025,” Jefferies (JEF-1.28%)’ chief U.S. economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients. The Fed’s policy in this cycle has been reactive, however, so it’s likely to stay on hold for now, he added. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Forbes Daily: Tariff ‘Liberation Day’ Sinks Stocks As China Retaliates

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump’s tariff “Liberation Day” turned into a Wall Street bloodbath. The tariffs on nearly all foreign nations are widely expected to raise prices for American consumers. And despite the White House’s insistence that they would not cause “pain,” investors are already feeling it. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, and the Nasdaq cratered 6%—their steepest daily percentage losses since 2020. The “Magnificent Seven” tech companies that drove much of the gains in recent years were the biggest losers from the tariff losses, but retail also struggled, as many firms manufacture their goods abroad. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Wall Street is souring on President Donald Trump. A new Forbes survey of 50 Wall Street bigs shows that many who supported the Trump campaign’s economic promises before he took office have abandoned him, with a vast majority now disapproving of the president’s economic policies. More than half of our respondents supported Trump’s economic plan as he reentered the White House in January, but 72% now say the Trump team’s economic plan has been ineffective. China will impose an additional 34% import duty on all U.S. goods starting next week, in retaliation against President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 34% “reciprocal tariff” on Chinese goods, the state media announced on Friday. All three major futures indexes nosedived sharply after the Chinese announcement, with Dow Futures falling nearly 2.9%, the benchmark S&P 500 dropping nearly 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq futures down 3.1%. Small business owners looking to borrow money from lending institutions may have to answer a new question: How will President Donald Trump’s tariffs affect their business? And while some companies may benefit long-term if manufacturing returns to the U.S., many will suffer in the interim because they can’t fully pass on increased costs to customers. The DOGE cuts made what would have otherwise been a “fairly quiet” March for layoffs the worst since spring 2020, a new report found. Employers shed more than 275,000 positions last month, and the first three months of the year saw the most quarterly jobs cut since Q1 in 2009, during the Great Recession. RH Chairman and CEO Gary Friedman Thursday’s tariff-induced stock market losses wiped almost $300 billion from the fortunes of the world’s billionaires, and some of the biggest losers are those who’ve tried to make recent in-roads with Trump. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg saw his wealth fall by $17.9 billion since Wednesday’s market close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who was $16 billion poorer on Thursday. In percentage terms, the biggest billionaire loser of the trade war was Gary Friedman, the CEO of retailer RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, whose fortune tanked from $1.2 billion on Tuesday to an estimated $750 million Thursday, a drop of 39%. About an hour into the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Friedman was heard reacting as shares fell 26% in after-hours trading: “Oh sh*t,” he said. MORE: Meanwhile, the day’s biggest winner was Latin America’s richest person, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, who got $2.1 billion richer as of Thursday afternoon. Mexico was not subject to additional tariffs in Trump’s announcement. Plaid CEO Zach Perret After its latest $575 million fundraise, Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is valued at $6.1 billion—less than half the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. Still, the fintech market has gotten a recent boost following a downward trajectory that began in 2022, with fintechs raising roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally in the first quarter of 2025, according to CB Insights. Illustration by Fernando Capeto for Forbes; Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images and Justin Sullivan/Getty Images There’s a long, storied list of famous auto industry flops, from stinkers like Ford’s Edsel and exploding Pinto to General Motors’s unsightly Pontiac Aztek crossover SUV. Elon Musk’s pet project, the dumpster-driving Tesla Cybertruck, now tops it. After a little over a year at market, sales of the 6,600-pound vehicle, priced from $82,000, are laughably below what Musk predicted. Its lousy reputation for quality—with eight recalls in the past 13 months—and polarizing look made it a punchline for comedians. Unlike past auto flops that just looked ridiculous or sold badly, Musk’s truck is also a focal point for global Tesla protests spurred by the billionaire’s job-slashing DOGE role and MAGA politics. Judged solely on sales, Musk’s Cybertruck is actually doing a lot worse than Edsel, a name that’s become synonymous with a disastrous product misfire. Ford hoped to sell 200,000 Edsels a year when it hit the market in 1958, but managed just 63,000. Sales plunged in 1959 and the brand was dumped in 1960. Musk predicted that Cybertruck might see 250,000 annual sales. Tesla sold just under 40,000 in 2024, its first full year. There’s no sign that volume is rising this year, with sales trending lower in January and February, according to Cox Automotive. WHY IT MATTERS “Musk’s miscalculation of what pickup truck buyers want was a costly one, as Tesla likely invested an estimated $900 million to develop Cybertruck,” says Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. “The fact that those costs can’t be shared with other Tesla vehicles compounds the problem. Tesla’s billionaire CEO once bragged that he does ‘no market research whatsoever.’ In retrospect, he might want to start.” MORE Things Are Bad At Tesla. They’re About To Get Much Worse. President Donald Trump’s tariffs will likely increase prices for a number of goods, from new cars to coffee and iPhones. The tariffs include a baseline 10% rate, with some trading partners facing higher taxes: $2,300: The potential price tag of an iPhone 16 Pro Max, assuming a 43% price increase for the devices as predicted by analysts from Rosenblatt Securities to offset the cost of tariffs 80%: The share of coffee beans imported into the U.S. that come from Latin America, where top producers face 10% tariffs 20%: The tariff that wine produced across European Union nations will face, with France and Italy being the U.S.’s top suppliers in 2021 The stock market’s recent losses are a reminder that your stock portfolio is a long-term asset. While it’s okay to pick individual stocks for a small share of your investments (think 10%), the rest should be in a fund. The most important consideration when evaluating a stock ETF is that it should be big and cheap, so your savings don’t get eroded by annual fees—but it’s also important to look at factors like taxes. President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs target more than 180 nations, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands, considered to be one of the wildest and most remote places on Earth. The islands are territory of which country? A. The United Kingdom B. Australia C. Denmark D. France Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

Stocks may extend their post-tariff sell-off Friday after China retaliated with its own 34% duties on all U.S. goods, restrictions on rare earth exports, and other measures. Futures linked to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all pointing to a lower open. The Magnificent 7 stocks extend their slide on Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA+1.18%) plunging 3.6% and Apple (AAPL-3.08%) dropping 4.8% in premarket trading as of 8:50 a.m. EDT.

Title: Washington Post Opinions section anxiously awaits new leader after Jeff Bezos pushed David Shipley out

Former Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron joined MediaBuzz to discuss why he is disgusted with Bezos new mandate and why the move has garnered backlash at the publication. The Washington Post has faced an exodus of talent in recent months and remaining staffers, particularly in the Opinions section, are on pins and needles waiting to see where the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper is heading. Billionaire owner Jeff Bezos has routinely irked current and former employees since he famously stopped the editorial page from endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, prompting several staffers to leave the paper. His latest high-profile decision pushed Opinions section editor David Shipley out the door and put the unit in limbo until a replacement is named, a staffer told Fox News Digital. Discouraged Post employees feel it’s not the best time to work in the paper’s Opinions section and aren’t sure if Bezos’ relationship with President Donald Trump will impact who replaces Shipley. Staffers also feel that things haven’t been quite the same since the sudden 2021 death of treasured editorial page editor Fredd Hiatt. At the time, Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote that Hiatt’s unexpected passing marked the end of "a period of remarkable stability at the top of The Washington Post’s masthead."

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via Getty Images; SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) "Remarkable stability" is certainly not a term that Post’s staffers would use to describe their place of employment nowadays. Hiatt, who predated Bezos’ takeover of the paper, was eventually replaced by Shipley after a months-long process that saw the paper’s Opinions section go leaderless for the first half of 2022. Opinions section staffers are currently frustrated that they worked through a long interregnum only three years ago, and now they’re doing that again. Bezos announced in February that Shipley had decided to step away when the Amazon founder pushed for major changes to the Post’s Opinions section. "We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others," Bezos wrote on X, announcing the decision. Bezos said Shipley was offered the opportunity to continue to lead the opinion section and declined. Now, Opinions section employees are aware that it takes quite a while to solicit applicants and conduct interviews for such a high-profile position and staffers are concerned that they’ll either be without a leader for another extended period, or that rushing the process will result in yet another transition in the near future if the hire isn’t up to the task. Following Bezos’ decision not to endorse Harris, 11 Post opinion columnists wrote a statement calling the decision a "terrible mistake." The decision also irked liberal staffers and readers alike, but Bezos has repeatedly defended the decision.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Eyebrows inside the Post were raised even further since Election Day, as Bezos visited Mar-a-Lago and attended Trump’s inauguration, indicating their once-frosty relationship has healed for the moment. Trump claimed in a recent interview with OutKick's Clay Travis that Bezos disparaged some of his own newspaper's staffers as "crazy people." Longtime Washington Post reporter Paul Farhi left the paper in 2023 but keeps a close eye on his former employer and believes morale issues loom large. "There’s great disappointment in Bezos and widespread suspicion and concern about his relationship with Trump," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Still unclear how Bezos’ remaking of the editorial pages is going to play out -- not sure it will be more pro-Trump, although that is also the prevailing suspicion," Farhi added. "My sense is that morale continues to be terrible." A Washington Post spokesperson declined comment on "personnel updates," but noted a series of recent accolades the Opinions section has achieved, including the inaugural Goldsmith Prize for Explanatory Reporting.

(SAUL LOEB/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) While the Opinions section waits for a new leader, other departments have also hemorrhaged both money and talent. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Post "lost around $100 million" in 2024 as subscriptions and ad-revenue plummeting took a toll on the paper. The paper has also seen layoffs and top journalists, including Philip Rucker, Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Pager, Hannah Allam, and Matea Gold have all left. Longtime liberal columnist Eugene Robinson also left the paper on Thursday, marking the latest high-profile exit. Another liberal columnist, Jennifer Rubin, fled the Post earlier this year in protest of Bezos. TRUMP APPLAUDS JEFF BEZOS’ CHANGES AT WASHINGTON POST IN RARE MEDIA PRAISE The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the paper after her bosses rejected her illustration depicting Bezos groveling to Trump. Opinion columnist Ruth Marcus recently announced she was leaving the paper after a 40-year stint, citing Bezos' plans to reshape the Opinions section. Marcus said Bezos and other tech tycoons who attended the inauguration were akin to being Trump’s "trophies."

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Pool via REUTERS) "His presence on the inaugural platform conveyed a message of support for Trump that, I can say now, was inappropriate," Marcus wrote in the New Yorker. Farhi said the "bright side" is that the news side of the Post has "been doing superb reporting" on Trump and DOGE leader Elon Musk’s efforts to crack down on government spending. Farhi has noticed that Bezos and CEO Will Lewis have refrained from "meddling" in straight-news coverage and that Trump hasn’t been criticizing the paper on social media, which was a common practice during his first administration. "It’s possible Bezos has come to some kind of truce with Trump, but at great cost to his integrity and to the integrity of the Post," Farhi said.

Publisher - What's Cool In Road Cycling Gear Break: Q36.5 Gregarius Clima Dolomites Extreme jersey, Topeak Pakgo gearpack II, letting it ride: How cycling manufacturers are harnessing 3D printing technology to revolutionize the design and manufacturing of saddles, Pirelli P Zero Race RS – The new tube-type version combining practicality and lightness with top performance levels made for racing, “Out of Sight” — Ritchey’s new WCS Switch Stem and mountainFLOW unveils groundbreaking eco-friendly water bottle & mobile bike wash. Q36.5 Gregarius Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey – $172 Q36.5 sez: With a body mapped cut, the Q36.5 Gregarius Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey conforms perfectly to the shape of the torso, enhancing the aero benefits. The arms and shoulders are cut to ensure no fabric bunches up behind the neck and no material flaps in the wind. The longer arm length also works to keep an aero edge. The Dolomites Extreme Jersey is inspired by and dedicated to the extreme Dolomites adventures that are made possible by choosing the right clothing equipment. Chuck Peña PEZ sez: PEZ got the Dolomites Extreme collection’s flagship jersey in the “can’t be missed” tangerine red colorway (it’s also available in black and ice grey). Besides the color, the first thing you notice is the bold graphic on the front. Per Q36.5: the Q36.5 Gregarius Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey features our new #radarfocus logo first launched with the 2025 Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team kit. The radar is the ultimate symbol of both focus and navigation under difficult conditions, metaphors of the high performance qualities of Q36.5 The graphic is repeated, but smaller, on the back with the full inscription legible: SCIENTIAE OFFICIALIS INVESTIGATOR, which translates as “research scientist.” The second thing to notice about the Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey is how light it is. As a jersey designed for riding in the heat of summer and conquering epic climbs, lightness is a key factor. Q36.5 specs 112 grams for size M Construction-wise, the Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey is relatively “conventional:” 1 – front 3D panel, 2- side sheer panel, 3 – rear honeycomb panel, 4 – ribbed sleeves Instead of silicone gripper, the Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey relies on an elasticized strip to help keep the jersey in place What makes the Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey different from a lot of other jerseys is their proprietary technical materials. The front is a 3-dimensional fabric for wicking and to create a natural air barrier between the skin and the jersey for improved cooling in extreme heat conditions. The back is a honeycomb mesh material designed to move sweat away from the skin to the outer layer where it can evaporate. Again, important for riding in extreme heat conditions. When I ran my fingers on the inside, I could feel the 3-dimensional aspect of the fabric Honeycombs for sweat, not honey What’s also different about the Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey is how Q36.5 designs the fit: a body mapped cut that conforms perfectly to the shape of the torso, enhancing the aero benefits. The arms and shoulders are cut to ensure no fabric bunches up behind the neck and no material flaps in the wind. Raw cut sleeve for comfort and ribbed for speed #aero Per Q36.5’s size guide, I chose XS which fit me (5’8″, 130 pounds, ectomorph) well. Which is to say, a close to the skin race fit but not spray-on uber tight. Mesh pockets are semi-see through We’ve had some warmer, i.e., sunny and temps in the 70s (F), days here in the Lowcountry (and a few days in the low 80s), but it’s not quite yet truly hot (and humid). But just judging by how airy and cool the Clima Dolomites Extreme Jersey was in such temps, I fully expect it will hold up well when it gets hotter. I’m not expecting air conditioning, but a good test will be to see how it does without a baselayer during the dog days of summer (although I always ride with a baselayer even when it’s sticky hot and humid). More to follow! Topeak Pakgo Gearpack II Stephen Cheung PEZ Sez. You can always use a big tote bag or duffel bag for your race-day kit, but it can be a nightmare finding where you left that little baggie of safety pins. Well, hopefully you’ve bagged them up or put them in a box rather letting them float free! There are cycling-specific race-day organizers that hew to the duffel bag philosophy, with several large compartments that you’re free to stuff to your own design and desire. Topeak Pakgo Gearpack II is a gear packer’s delight at the other end of the spectrum, as it definitely follows the organizational mantra of “A place for everything and everything in its place.” Rated at 38 L capacity with a max weight of 3 kg, the Pakgo Gearpack II features 3 main compartments (1 top-load, 2 side-load), two semi-rigid clamshell sides that zip out to more storage, and a host of other smaller compartments to hide things to your heart’s delight. I tested it out by packing like I would for cyclocross, which demands a wide range of kits for every potential condition. The top “jersey” compartment, even with the “helmet” compartment below full, could hold SS/LS base layers along with SS/LS jerseys. In the “helmet” compartment I fitted a winter jacket, rain jacket, and helmet. There is also a key loop inside. In the “shoe” department I went with lower body kit: shoes, socks rolled into one shoe, kneewarmers rolled into the other shoe, and bib shorts. Not just one but two options for your helmet. There is a large helmet compartment where you can also put extra gear. Or else you can loop the helmet around two stretchy loops and clip the back end to the snap loop. The downside of the latter method is that you lose easy quick access to the “helmet” compartment. The zip pocket up top is useful for race nutrition along with race license, wallet. The semi-rigid clamshell sides can either be unbuckled to lie fully flat, or buckled to lie at a 45° angle. The stretchy mesh folder-sized compartment is the place for HR straps, sunglasses, mini-pumps, gloves. There’s a zipped, waterproof slot in case things get ugly or muddy. It’s fairly small so it’s not going to fit much more than a jersey though, so don’t forget a plastic trash bag as a backup. Worse case, there are four drain holes at the bottom of the Packgo Gearpack. To haul the Pakgo Gearpack around, there’s the pair of handles up top. Or you can pull out the backpack straps stored in a side pocket and clip the straps to the bottom loops. The straps and the back are padded for cushioning, and the sternum strap helps with stability. Without crazy-stuffing the Pakgo Gearpack II to its limits, I was able to pack: SS/LS base layer, SS/LS jerseys, rain shell, winter thermal jacket, HR strap, bib shorts, knee/leg warmers, thin socks, thicker merino socks, off-road shoes, short-finger gloves, thermal gloves, sunglasses, mini-pump, race nutrition packs. If I needed more internal room, the exterior helmet option would free up more. One noticeable missing feature are compartments for water bottles, but presumably you would store them on your bike itself when travelling. Final Verdict To me, the Pakgo Gearpack II would be a useful option for cyclists as a one-stop luggage solution for race days or whenever you’re driving somewhere to start your ride. It would also be useful for runners, but I wouldn’t say that there’s sufficient capacity for multisport athletes. Letting it Ride: How Cycling Manufacturers are harnessing 3D Printing technology to Revolutionize the Design and Manufacturing of Saddles By Andrew Sink, Staff Applications Engineer, Carbon Fizik creates custom saddles for riders using Carbon’s 3D printing technology For a long time, when it came to designing saddles for bikes, striking a balance between comfort, performance and durability has been the goal. However, meeting these objectives has come with limitations, mainly insofar as the materials used. Foam and molded materials for saddles, such as plastic, were widely used for their durability and affordability but often failed to deliver personalized support and long-term resilience. Poorly designed saddles can lead to discomfort, numbness, poor posture, lower back pain and even potential injury due to bad pressure distribution on sensitive areas, driving the demand for seating that is comfortable, durable and increasingly personalized to the individual. 3D printing/additive manufacturing is disrupting this application area, offering new possibilities of customization, efficiency and innovation which were not previously attainable. By designing lattice structures that offer precise pressure distribution, brands are demonstrating that the future of saddles lies in 3D printing technology. Leading brands are taking to 3D printing to reimagine their saddle designs. These companies include the likes of US bicycle manufacturer, Specialized, whose award-winning S-Works Power with Mirror Technology has received rave reviews from cycling enthusiasts. The Specialized S-Works Power Saddle with Mirror built on the Carbon platform Demonstrating the capabilities of Digital Light Synthesis™ (DLS) 3D printing technology, the S-Works Power Saddle with Mirror comprises a complex multizonal lattice structure designed for optimal pressure relief and comfort. Proving the scalability of the technology, that particular saddle has since paved the way for the introduction of the S-Works Romin Evo with Mirror, which was specially developed for the performance cycling market. Thanks to the flexibility of the DLS technology deployed to develop this saddle, the project took just six months from prototype to commercialization. Similarly, Italian biking accessory brand, Fizik, has a solid track record of using technology and data to create revolutionary products that elevate the rider experience. Having successfully leveraged elastomeric materials, lattice design software and DLS 3D printing technology, the company recently set itself the challenge of harnessing the same technology to develop a fully customized 3D printed saddle topper that would provide maximum support, stability, and comfort, minimizing pressure points and enhancing aerodynamic efficiency. Collaborating with pressure map data experts at gebioMized, Fizik engineered a system for collecting pressure map data (specifically the body force transferred to the saddle as well as how that force is distributed across the saddle’s surface) from riders to customize a saddle design with distinctive zonal cushioning tuned to adapt specifically to the rider’s body. This data is subsequently translated into the 3D printed lattice structure using Carbon Custom Production Software, resulting in a highly personalized supportive saddle optimized for comfort and performance. Selle Italia’s Shortfit 2.0 saddle is made from durable, highly elastomeric, energy-returning EPU 41 material that offers cushioning and gripping for the rider The Saddle of Champions By capitalizing on the flexibility of 3D printing, the company was granted the means to very quickly and cost-effectively develop individually designed one-off saddle paddings. The result is Fizik’s recently launched, fully customized, 3D printed One-to-One saddle, now in use by professional riders like Tadej Pogačar who, in February this year, rode his personalized Aeris LD One-to-One saddle as he sealed victory on the 2025 UAE Tour. Another brand to have firmly embraced 3D printing technology to revolutionize its design to production workflow is saddle manufacturer, Selle Italia. To meet the highest levels of performance that its elite cyclists required, Selle Italia wanted to find a material that was not only supportive for riders but was also breathable and ultimately provided a more comfortable ride. Requirements included: Working closely with Carbon production partner, Prototek, Selle Italia was recommended EPU 41 material – a durable, highly elastomeric, energy-returning material that offers cushioning and gripping for the rider. This particular material also lends itself to multi-zonal lattice designs that are extremely breathable and can be tuned precisely to offer a variety of mechanical responses for an overall better ride. The company has since expanded its 3D printed line to include those for performance cycling, comfort cycling, and triathlons – the first ever made with 3D printing and developed in partnership with reigning men’s IRONMAN World Champion Patrick Lange. The utilization of 3D printing by industry leading brands such as Specialized, Fizik and Selle Italia, and the revolutionary saddle designs that they are able to realize, is indicative of the transformative nature of this technology. Not only does it successfully address long-standing challenges in rider comfort but also sets the standard for future innovations and increased customization to suit the individual. As companies like Carbon continue to innovate their technology offering, it paves the way for even greater product design innovation among brands like these and many others. Fizik uses Carbon’s 3D printing technology to produce customised lattice-based saddles with distinctive zonal cushioning tuned to adapt specifically to the rider’s body Andrew Sink is a Staff Applications Engineer at Carbon, a product development and manufacturing technology company whose technologies portfolio enable brands to design, develop, and manufacture data-driven, high-performance comfort and protection products that are breezy, aesthetic, and custom. Pirelli P Zero Race RS – The New Tube-Type Version Combining Practicality and Lightness with Top Performance Levels Made for Racing It’s the tube-type option of the top-range P ZERO Race TLR RS It benefits from the experience of World Tour teams Lidl-Trek and Alpecin-Deceuninck An FSC® labelled, Italian-made product from the Milan-Bollate plant Milan (Italy), March 29, 2025 – Pirelli is launching the P ZERO Race RS, the tube-type version of its top-performing road racing tyre. P ZERO Race RS is the latest addition to the P ZERO Race bicycle tyres produced in Pirelli’s Milan-Bollate plant. This new clincher model, like all the tyres made by Pirelli Cycling’s Italian factory starting from June 2024, uses natural rubber* that is FSC® certified (Forest Stewardship Council® – an NGO that is recognised worldwide for its responsible forest management activities). P ZERO Race RS is Pirelli’s top product in the high-performance road line, in the tube-type segment and, as it is the case with the all-rounder P ZERO Race TLR and its clincher counterpart P ZERO Race, the new tyre now joins the P ZERO Race TLR RS version, Pirelli’s top of the range tubeless ready tyre. Pirelli can thus offer cycling enthusiasts two high-profile tyre options, which is further proof of the company’s commitment to the two most popular technologies today among end consumers. Designed and developed specifically for the many fans who constantly seek the high performance levels, practicality and lightness provided by clincher tyres, this new version also benefits from the positive feedback of some of today’s top cyclists. Riders from the Alpecin Deceuninck and Lidl-Trek World Tour teams, have had the chance to test them during training camps or to compete with them on some Alpine stages of the past season’s great Tours. Pirelli has developed the new P ZERO Race RS specifically to be used with its light, high performing SmarTUBE inner tube, aiming to provide cyclists with a setup that offers a significant weight advantage. Thanks to this combination, it is possible to save nearly 50g per wheel without compromising rolling efficiency. In fact, rolling resistance preserves absolute values that are very similar to those of Pirelli’s latest generation of TLR tyres, ensuring responsiveness and a fast, efficient riding experience. New-Generation Smartevo Compound P ZERO Race RS uses the SmartEVO2 compound with its original formula, which is further developed when it comes to its chemistry and process. Produced in the same Pirelli plants that create the motorsport compounds, SmartEVO2is the result of a “smart” polymer compound – i.e. chemically treated to enhance the functions of the various polymeric chains – created to simultaneously offer adherence and speed to the tyre, which now have been further improved. P ZERO Race RS, Pirelli’s most advanced version of tube-type road tyre, is already available for purchase at the best cycling shops and online. It comes in sizes 26-622, 28-622 and 30- 622, while its sides come in three colours: Standard, Classic and Retrò. The tyre in size 28- 622 weighs 230 grams. (*the percentage of natural rubber out of the total weight of the tyre is equal to about 14% and is the product’s most important component – FSC® N003618 license). “Out of Sight” — Ritchey’s New WCS Switch Stem Today Ritchey announced its new WCS Switch stem as an essential part of the Ritchey Switch System, an integrated system for bikes with internally routed cables, wires, and hydraulic lines. Ritchey’s new WCS Switch stem is much more than meets the eye. This innovative stem packs a number of features — more than just stealthily concealed routing into the headset and frame. A close look at the front of the WCS Switch stem features the tried-and-true Ritchey C220 clamp design meant to use the body of the stem to wrap around bars a full 220-degrees, thus alleviating stress on the face plate while using lower faceplate bolt torque. Along with increased width for additional stiffness, the clamping area rotated a few degrees downward to create a flat, sleek, lower profile stem body. But wait, there’s more! Working in tandem with the clamp, the WCS Switch stem also includes a reversible accessory for mounting accessories, like cycling computers, lights, and cameras. This mount is completely hidden inside the stem’s front clamp until you decide to mount your favorite accessory. The cavity of the stem can conceal up to three cables with housing to effortlessly integrate with the Ritchey Switch System spacers and Switch headset (both sold separately) to cleanly route the hidden cables into the frame. The Ritchey WCS Switch stem includes a matching compression cap. About the Ritchey Switch System The Ritchey Switch System is an innovative integrated collection designed to easily \ internally route cables, wires, and hydraulic lines from the handlebar into bicycle frames using a 1.5″ upper headset bearing.

I am only trying to iron out that situation where the US market falls 20-25%, then this oil fall and all will not matter.

Indian frontline indices opened in the red on Friday following global sell-off in the equity markets in reaction to the reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump. At 9:23 am, Sensex was down 544 points or 0.71 per cent at 75,750 and Nifty was down 194 points or 0.82 per cent at 23,059. Midcap and smalcap stocks witnessed selling pressure in the early trading hour. Nifty midcap 100 index was down 669 points or 1.34 per cent at 51,464 and Nifty small 100 index was down 253 points or 1.56 per cent at 16,001. On the sectoral front, auto, IT, PSU bank, pharma, FMCG, metal, realty and energy were major laggards. Only finance services was trading with gains. In the Sensex pack, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel and M&M were top gainers. Tata Motors, Tata Steel, L&T, IndusInd Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Sun Pharma, Infosys and Tech Mahindra were the top losers. Following the announcement of Trump tariffs, global markets experienced jitters overnight, leading to a gap-down opening indicated by the Gift Nifty. Selling was seen in most Asian markets. Tokyo, Bangkok and Seoul were in the red. The US markets witnessed a massive sell-off on Thursday after reciprocal tariffs were announced. The Dow closed by nearly 4 per cent down and the technology index Nasdaq down by nearly 6 per cent. On the institutional front, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling streak for the fourth consecutive session on April 3, offloading equities worth Rs 2,806 crore. In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remained net buyers for the fifth consecutive day, purchasing equities worth Rs 221.47 crore. According to market observers, on the upside, immediate resistance is seen at 23,350, followed by 23,600 for Nifty. "A breakout beyond these levels could trigger a continuation of the uptrend, targeting the 200 DSMA in the 24,000-24,100 range. While the index may remain range-bound in the near term, stock-specific trades are offering better opportunities, and traders should focus on individual names for potential gains," said Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivative - Angel One.

Nvidia (NVDA+1.42%) fell with other Magnificent 7 stocks on Thursday as the market reacted to new tariffs — but the company also may’ve slipped because a major bank downgraded it for unrelated reasons. The chipmaker’s shares were down 6.6% during pre-market trading on Thursday morning, less than a day after President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs against U.S. trade partners. At the market open Thursday, Nvidia’s shares were down 4.9% — and then fell an additional 1.3% during mid-day trading. The company ended the day down 7.8% at the market close. However, Altimeter Capital chief executive Brad Gerstner told CNBC that he expects Nvidia to fair well amid the Trump administration’s new tariffs. “The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,” Gerstner said during an appearance on “Fast Money Halftime Report.” He added that semiconductors are exempted from the tariffs — a “wise exception” — because of the global AI race. Meanwhile, HSBC (HSBC-2.93%) analyst Frank Lee downgraded his rating for the company’s stock from “buy” to “hold” on Thursday, citing concerns over Nvidia’s ability to continue its strong growth. Lee said Nvidia had previously had strong pricing power due to its dominance of the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential to powering generative artificial intelligence models, according to MarketWatch (NWSA+0.66%). However, that pricing power could have less of an impact in the future, as the company hasn’t raised average selling prices. It “is likely to cap earnings upside momentum,” Lee reportedly said in the note. He also noted that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking, due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) have tentatively agreed to form a joint venture that would run the U.S. company’s foundry business. TSMC, the world's largest chip manufacturer, will own a 20% stake in the combined company, according to reports citing The Information. TSMC declined to remark on the reports, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Intel’s foundry division produces chips for third-party customers. The business has long been the subject of deal speculation, including a report last month that TSMC approached several other chipmakers about a joint venture to operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities. The report of a tentative deal also comes less than a day after President Trump announced a sweeping package of tariffs against goods imported from other countries. Intel shares gained 2% Thursday, while TSMC shares lost close to 8% amid a broad-based decline as worries about the new tariffs rattled markets.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: I finally get the Costco hype now that I moved from an apartment to a house. Here are 18 purchases I swear by.

Time Published: 2025-04-03T20:00:02Z
Full Content:
I grew up in New York City and have always lived in small apartments without much storage space. It just never made sense for me to buy groceries in bulk. However, my partner and I recently moved to Los Angeles, and now we have a whole house to ourselves. One of the best perks of our new life is taking monthly trips to Costco for all our favorite items. Here are my favorite things to get there. We tend to have a Costco shopping trip at least once a month, and I also go there about once a week to fuel my car. Gas is expensive, especially in Los Angeles, and Costco typically has unbeatable prices — particularly for premium, which is what my Mini Cooper takes. The best part is I can easily check the rate on a daily basis when using the store's app, which helps me determine if Costco gas prices are better than competitors that day. My partner is a carnivore to the max. To him, nothing beats the five-pack of the Kirkland Signature boneless New York steaks. They taste great on the grill or in a cast-iron pan and are often the star of a delicious weekday meal for us. We never skip out on buying Costco's ribs, especially since we can get over 9 pounds of meat for about $35. The store also stocks pre-seasoned ribs, which are great when we're out of our homemade dry rub. We'll make these for ourselves or when having friends over for a barbecue. I'm a huge fan of Kirkland Signature products, and I especially like the label's organic Greek yogurt. It's perfect for making smoothies creamy or adding protein to granola. Now that I live in a house, I have room in my freezer to buy staples in bulk, like frozen strawberries. I'm usually pretty happy with the prices of frozen fruit at Costco, so I pick up mixed berries or strawberries there. Recently, I got 4 pounds of Kirkland Signature organic strawberries for $10, which felt like a steal compared to prices I've seen at other local grocery stores. Again, now that I have the space, I'm able to buy more household staples in bulk. We often pick up big packs of the Kirkland Signature paper towels and store them in our shed to optimize kitchen space. These affordable paper towels are thick and powerful. One 12-pack of rolls often lasts us over two months, especially since we supplement the use of them with microfiber cloths. Since we live in a house with a ton of random gadgets, we somehow always need batteries. I try to keep a few varieties on hand. Fortunately, we've found Kirkland Signature batteries to be fairly affordable and easy to buy in bulk. They especially came in handy during the recent California wildfires, when we lost power and needed to use flashlights. Working from home, I get distracted and find myself not hydrating frequently or as much as I should. So, I like that I can use Liquid IV to boost the flavor and hydration power of my water with electrolytes and sugar-free flavoring. I'm usually not able to find sugar-free Liquid IV at my local grocery stores, but Costco always seems to have some packs in stock. My partner and I typically each eat one Kirkland Signature protein bar a day. I don't eat too much meat, so these bars help me easily get 21 grams of protein when I need a boost. We usually buy the variety pack with 10 cookie-dough and 10 brownie bars. My partner likes the cookie-dough flavor, and I prefer the brownie one — a match made in heaven. I'm a huge date girl. Dates really are nature's candy. I love eating them raw on their own, making date bark with some peanut butter and chocolate chips, or incorporating them into a smoothie or yogurt bowl. They're a great source of fiber, potassium, and magnesium too. I love baking, but quality vanilla extract is a key ingredient in many recipes that can be expensive and hard to find in larger quantities. At Costco, however, I can find 16 ounces of pure vanilla extract for under $12. To me, that's an amazing deal. Kirkland Signature honey is one of our pantry staples since I'm a huge tea fan and love adding it to my drinks. I also recently got my partner into peppermint tea, which can be enhanced with a dollop of honey. This honey tastes high-quality — and getting three 24-ounce bottles of it for under $13 feels like a bargain. Yes, I still struggle with acne in my late 20s. I really like the pimple patches from Hero because they can hardly be seen when they're applied correctly. I'll often wear one or two when I'm traveling on a plane, taking a between-Zoom-meeting stroll, or even having virtual calls. The stickers help me avoid picking at my skin, and I'm a firm believer they make my pimples disappear much faster. As someone who deals with allergies, I always try to keep medication on hand that will help me deal with symptoms. Name-brand options can get pricey, especially since I take tablets every day. So, I opt for Kirkland Signature allergy medicine. The $5 bottle of 600 pills does my wallet a huge favor. One of the first things we did when moving into our first place together was buy a first-aid kit. After that, we stocked up on some of our staple medications, like ibuprofen Since moving to Los Angeles, my skin has struggled to adjust to the dry climate. So, I've been buying bulk packs of the CeraVe moisturizing cream and using it morning and night. Hydrating and not greasy, the cream has been my hero as of late. Plus, it's fairly affordable at Costco at $25 for two 16-ounce tubs. Perhaps one of the best things about Costco is that it's truly a one-stop shop. I always check the retailer's clothing section and often pick up a piece or two. My latest favorite purchase is the $18 two-piece lounge set from Honeydew. It's so cozy and especially great on long car or plane rides. Lastly, we end our shopping trip with celebratory Costco hot dogs, which cost just $1.50 each and come with a soft drink.

Title: SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Berger Montague Reminds AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) Investors of Class Action Lawsuit Deadline

April 03, 2025 15:44 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) on behalf of purchasers of AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 through February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 5, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin is a developer of a software-based platform for advertisers. According to the complaint, AppLovin and senior management misled investors regarding AppLovin’s financial growth and stability, raising expectations as to the launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and the use of “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analysts Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research each published reports accusing AppLovin of, among other things, reverse-engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged that AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, thus presenting false installation numbers and profits. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025 – a decline of $46.06 per share, or 12%. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel.

Title: Not a Meme! DePIN Can Take Crypto Mainstream
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/04/03/not-a-meme-depin-can-take-crypto-mainstream
Time Published: 2025-04-03T19:38:26Z

For years, the crypto market has thrived on speculation, where excitement, hype and fleeting trends attract value instead of fundamentals. Investors have continually poured money into tokens fueled by viral moments, chasing rapid gains. Time and again, a select few of these investments soar to incredible heights, only to come crashing down. With over 33 million tokens in circulation, the competition to attract attention gets harder and harder and investor attention is ever more fleeting. But DePIN can change this. With compelling businesses attracting real customers and revenue built on well designed token economics, DePIN can set a new standard of fundamentals in crypto. As our DePIN Token Economics Report outlines, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) offer a number of compelling businesses with fundamental value. Unlike typical crypto projects driven by speculation, DePIN offers a different approach. It uses blockchain technology to support real-world infrastructure, creating tangible value and generating real revenue. Instead of relying on hype, it builds a financial system based on actual demand, making it a more sustainable and practical model. Rather than resembling major crypto networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, DePIN operates more like capital-light marketplaces such as Uber and Airbnb, but with key distinctions. While both models connect providers with customers without funding infrastructure, DePIN providers are compensated in tokens that can appreciate in value, akin to Uber drivers or Airbnb hosts receiving equity. Additionally, most DePINs sell to businesses which eliminates the need for massive marketing expenses required in building a consumer brand. DePIN offers a compelling business model and, unlike memes that come and go, it is the beginning of crypto’s transformation into a mature, revenue-generating industry. At its core, DePIN represents a paradigm shift. Traditionally, blockchain-based businesses have relied on hype to attract buyers. In the absence of traditional fundamentals, the industry cycled through endless metrics such as TPS, TVL, Telegram channel size, followers on X and many others. Many projects have attempted to build decentralized ecosystems. But, without real customers paying for services, they have largely functioned as economies fueled by speculation rather than external demand. DePIN changes this by integrating blockchain technology with physical and digital infrastructure, creating compelling services that generate revenue. Whether it is decentralized cloud computing, wireless networks, mapping or storage solutions, DePIN projects offer services like traditional businesses and with customers who pay for usage. When combined with the correct token economics, it creates a sustainable financial model. As DePIN generates growing revenue, it is likely to draw institutional investors who have long been skeptical of crypto’s reliance on hype and speculation. The projects that successfully correlate the token demand to actual business growth will not only survive the current market but also set the standard for the next generation of blockchain companies The report also highlights one of the most compelling aspects of DePIN, the use of buy-and-burn, which removes the need to have an expanding pool of new buyers. Instead, these projects use a portion of their revenue to repurchase and burn tokens, permanently reducing supply and potentially driving long-term price appreciation similar to stock buybacks. This approach is in stark contrast to most of crypto which relies on new buyers to sustain and grow their value.The buy-and-burn model ensures that as DePIN businesses grow and generate more revenue, their token ecosystems become more resilient to market fluctuations. Some DePIN tokens are already demonstrating this by decoupling from broader crypto market trends, proving that real-world adoption can lead to price stability and long-term investor confidence. While DePIN offers significant potential, it also comes with challenges. One major concern is transparency, as most projects lack traditional financial reports, audits, or clear revenue statements. However, blockchain itself provides a solution — on-chain verification through buy-and-burn mechanisms allows for real-time financial tracking, giving investors a clearer picture of a project’s health. Another challenge is customer adoption. Many businesses and consumers remain concerned due to crypto’s volatility. To address this, DePIN projects are introducing fiat payment options and stablecoin rewards, making it easier for everyday users to interact with these decentralized services without needing prior crypto or Web3 experience. For DePIN to succeed, its incentive structures must be designed to keep all stakeholders — providers, users, and investors aligned. One way to achieve alignment is through staking mechanisms, especially in cloud-based networks where service providers lock up tokens as collateral to guarantee reliability. Projects like Filecoin and Fluence already use this approach, ensuring accountability while strengthening network security. Others, such as Render and Livepeer, take a different route by distributing a share of network revenue to token stakers, creating a system similar to dividends that rewards long-term commitment. Governance will also be critical as DePIN projects decentralize. To prevent large token holders from short-term profiteering for quick gains, new governance models like quadratic voting and weighted staking are emerging. These frameworks help keep decision-making balanced, ensuring that projects remain sustainable and fair as they evolve. DePIN isn’t just another blockchain investment vehicle, it is laying the foundation for real, decentralized infrastructure. While meme coins have shown that crypto can generate hype, they rarely create lasting value. In contrast, DePIN is developing businesses that can compete with centralized companies by focusing on real-world utility. With token models backed by revenue, deflationary supply mechanics, and increasing interest from institutional investors, DePIN is redefining how blockchain networks should function. The projects that successfully address capital efficiency, align incentives, and navigate regulatory challenges will be the ones that lead this next phase of decentralized technology. As DePIN matures, its token models will continue to evolve. Optimizing capital efficiency through transparent buy-and-burn rates will ensure liquidity while maintaining long-term value. Governance structures will adapt to prevent short-term actors from derailing network growth. By 2026, DePIN will be recognized as the benchmark for sustainable blockchain economies, proving that crypto can function as more than a speculative asset class. The crypto industry stands at a crossroads. Investors, developers, and institutions must choose between supporting unsustainable token models or supporting projects that create real value. For the space to mature, it needs to move beyond pure speculation, and DePIN is at the forefront of that transformation.

Shares of Lyft (LYFT) dropped Thursday as Bank of America analysts gave the ride-hailing company the dreaded double downgrade. Lyft stock was recently down about 11% to roughly $11.50, leaving them down nearly 40% over the past 12 months. The analysts dropped their rating on the company's shares to "underperform" from "buy" and cut their price target to $10.50 from $17.50, which was a bit above the Street's consensus, according to Visible Alpha data. While most of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have neutral ratings on Lyft's shares, the mean target above $16 reflects some optimism, making Bank of America's change stand out. The bank's analysts cited concerns about Lyft's positioning in autonomous vehicles and "pricing headwinds" even as they cited a solid and growing user base as strengths. "We still see long-term potential for Lyft in [the] AV ecosystem, but given its still-nascent partnerships, we are losing confidence in near-term upside," they wrote. Lyft reported mixed fourth-quarter results in mid-February. Shares of Lyft fell as markets were under pressure due to trade-policy concerns. Uber (UBER), a key peer, saw its stock lose nearly 6%.

Title: The 10 Biggest Billionaire Losers Of The Tariff War So Far

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg (left), Jeff Bezos (center) and Elon Musk (right) at Donald Trump's inauguration in January, alongside Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez. Editor's note: This article was updated after the stock market close at 4 pm Eastern time on April 3, 2025. P resident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a flat 10% tariff on every country in the world, with higher rates for many of America’s largest trading partners including China, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the European Union. The news sent stock markets tumbling around the world on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index down 5% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite down 6%. Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Europe also suffered losses. That rout wiped a collective $270 billion from the fortunes of the world’s 3,000 billionaires. The biggest losers so far are the very richest people in the world, particularly those who have cozied up to Trump in recent times. No one has been hit harder than Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune is down by $17.9 billion since yesterday’s stock market close, as shares of the Facebook parent plummeted by 9%. Zuckerberg, who sat next to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk at Trump’s inauguration in January after Meta donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, has also met with the president at the White House several times since then—most recently on Wednesday. The second-biggest loser so far? Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who has recently tried to grow closer to Trump, sitting in the second row behind the president at his inauguration in January after Amazon donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. In February, he announced the Washington Post—which he bought for $250 million in 2013—would change its opinion pages to focus on supporting personal liberties and free markets. A month later, he opined on tariffs, saying in an X post that the opinion pages would cover "the damaging and distorting effects if tariffs are used to pick winners and losers." With Amazon shares down 9%, Bezos is $16 billion poorer on Thursday. Larry Ellison, the founder of software giant Oracle, is down $9.9 billion, thanks to a 6% drop in Oracle stock. (He’s also a major shareholder in Tesla.) Unlike Bezos and Zuckerberg, Ellison has long been a major donor to Republicans, and he hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2020 and dined with him at his Palm Beach club Mar-A-Lago last year. In January, he joined the president to announce a planned $500 billion investment in AI data centers in the U.S. alongside OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and Trump’s right-hand-man at the Department of Government Efficiency, is taking a beating, too. He has lost $8.7 billion, the fifth-most in dollar terms among billionaires, with Tesla shares slumping by more than 5% after a rough week in which the automaker announced its sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, who was the world’s richest person until last year, suffered an $8.6 billion loss as shares in his conglomerate LVMH dipped by nearly 6%. Arnault made a public display of support for Trump in January, attending his inauguration alongside two of his five children, who are all executives at LVMH. Besides Bezos and Zuckerberg, many other tech barons—including Michael Dell, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin—also saw steep losses. At least five billionaires have fallen out of the ranks entirely today. The biggest loser in percentage terms has been RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) CEO Gary Friedman, whose net worth has fallen by 37%, to about $730 million. Shares in the upscale furniture firm have plunged by 40%, wiping $435 million from Friedman’s fortune. Other dropoffs made their fortunes in the clothing industry, which could also be hard-hit by tariffs: The U.S. is the largest importer of apparel in the world, sourcing most apparel from Asia, including 21% from China and 18% from Vietnam. It’s no surprise then that husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Yvonne Lo, the Hong Kong-based cofounders of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, also have fallen below the $1 billion mark as shares in the Hong Kong-based firm tumbled by 23%. Crystal, which makes clothes for companies including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Nike, Adidas and Puma, relied on North America for 38% of its revenues in 2024. Brian Hill, the founder of Vancouver-based women's fashion retailer Aritzia, also saw his net worth fall below $1 billion as the firm's stock cratered by 20%. And how is Trump faring amid the market upheaval? Not so bad. The president’s net worth is down by $40 million, to $4.6 billion, as shareholders pushed the price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the parent company of his social media outfit Truth Social, down 3%, less than overall market’s decline. Here are the 10 biggest billionaire losers as of the market close:

April 03, 2025 14:22 ET | Source: DiCello Levitt LLP DiCello Levitt LLP SAN DIEGO, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025 (the “Class Period”), charging the Company and certain senior executives with violations of the federal securities laws (collectively, “Defendants”). Rocket Lab investors have until April 28, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. If you purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, and suffered substantial losses, and you wish to obtain additional information or serve as lead plaintiff in this lawsuit, you may submit your information and contact us here: https://dicellolevitt.com/securities/rocket-lab/.

Those who inquire by email are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. Case Allegations Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company that designs and manufactures small and medium-class rockets, spacecraft, and spacecraft components, including related software and services. In March 2021, the Company announced plans to develop Neutron, a reusable-ready medium-capacity launch vehicle to increase the payload capacity of its space launch vehicle. In early 2024, Rocket Lab announced it would conduct a test launch of Neutron in mid-2025, followed by three commercial launches in 2026 and five in 2027. The Rocket Lab lawsuit alleges that Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) the preparation of the launch pad was delayed by a critical potable water issue that was not going to be fixed until January 2026; (3) as a result, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. The truth emerged on February 25, 2025, when Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time” (the “Report”). In relevant part, the Report stated that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025, a timeline the company has repeatedly claimed in media interviews and on earnings calls.” The Report, citing documents and interviews with industry experts, further claimed that “[m]any aspects of RKLB’s Neutron program remain far behind where they need to be: from engine development, to engine and structure production, to launch pad construction, to rocket transport to the launch site.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab’s stock fell by $2.21 per share, or approximately 10%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025.

Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.

Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Trump's Tariffs Are a Bruising Defeat for the AI Industry

Time Published: 2025-04-03T17:29:13Z
Full Content:
If you follow tech stocks, there's probably one thing on your mind today: Donald Trump's tariffs. Yesterday, Trump announced his long-teased "reciprocal tariffs" on foreign imports coming into the US. Among them are a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, 24 percent on Japan, 26 percent on India, and 34 percent on China — all major players in the global tech trade. As a result, the magnificent seven (M7) stocks — a stock trader term for the current whales of the tech industry: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — are in a freefall today, as investors sell off their shares to brace for economic uncertainty. Among the tech industry, the stagnant AI sector is being hit particularly hard, as energy costs are anticipated to skyrocket along with the cost of important resources like steel, precious minerals, and semiconductors. As such, the cost to build and run data centers, the massive facilities that make AI computing possible, is expected to spike as the supply chain adjusts to the new normal. The vast majority of chips that power these data centers come from hard-hit countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam, while the US makes just 11 percent of its chips at home. Trump's tariffs will force countries from those companies to hike their chip prices, and US companies will no doubt hike their prices to compensate, which will ultimately run off to consumers. That's a crushing blow for American AI companies, which were already facing the consequences of investor skepticism, lagging revenue, and a disappointing debut AI IPO by CoreWeave. Broader details about how these tariffs will affect the tech industry are foggy right now, as the stock market is moving at a breakneck pace, but there is one common theme: everything is down. Apple, for example, is heading for its biggest single-day plunge in stock price in nearly 5 years, dropping over 8 percent in just the first few hours of trading. Other M7 stocks are likewise plummeting, with Amazon down almost 9 percent, and Nvidia down by 6.7 at the time of writing. Tesla has continued its months-long cascade with a 7 percent dip so far. If you're wondering why we're doing this, you're not alone. For decades, the United States has sat atop the global economic food chain. Thanks to years of military and economic supremacy, the US dollar became the world standard, making it easy to export cheap consumer goods as high-paying American jobs became starvation industries in countries dependent on US trade. Trump's tariffs seem to be an attempt to reverse all that — an economic experiment that's never really been attempted at this scale. The entire move hinges on the bet that companies will shift production from places like Vietnam and Taiwan back into the US, a gamble which business leaders say comes with high costs and even higher risks. As Trump's tariffs aren't enshrined in law, they could be easily undone by the courts or the next presidential administration, making a long-term investment into, say, a $5 billion semiconductor plant on US soil hard to justify from a business standpoint — and at the end of the day, isn't what this is all about?

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce.

Title: Trump Delusionally Brags About Tariffs as Stock Market Crashes

Time Published: 2025-04-03T16:01:35Z

In the topsy-turvy world of the Trump administration, market panic and financial suffering are somehow good things. The president unveiled his economic agenda on Wednesday, revealing steep tariff hikes on practically every country in the world—regardless of whether the U.S. is running a trade deficit or surplus there. The news sent markets reeling. But by Thursday morning, Donald Trump was still celebrating his plan. “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” But it’s unclear what metrics—if any—Trump used to measure his success. In reality, American businesses were seriously disturbed. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,500 points, about 3.5 percent, while the S&P 500 sank by 3.9 percent, setting both on pace for their worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The Nasdaq Composite tanked by more than 5 percent—bringing it down by 17 percent from its all-time high and down 13 percent year-to-date, the index’s worst performance since March 2020. Stock futures similarly plummeted. The value of the U.S. dollar dropped, and the price for a troy ounce of gold skyrocketed. Overnight, some of the country’s most competitive companies lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Nike and Lululemon, whose business models rely on international manufacturing deals in China and Vietnam, each lost more than 10 percent. Big-box stores also saw prominent losses: Best Buy, Target, and Home Depot lost 5 percent. The tech industry was similarly shaken: Apple was down 9 percent (worth approximately $300 billion in market value), Alphabet by 4 percent, Amazon by 7 percent, Meta by 7 percent, Microsoft by 3 percent, and Nvidia by 6 percent. Stores that rely heavily on imported goods saw their stocks tank too. Five Below lost 29 percent, Dollar Tree fell by 8 percent, and the Gap suffered a 22 percent loss. “The macro does not make sense, but the level of chaos and uncertainty, coupled with revaluing highly overpriced stocks, is hitting hard,” assessed CNBC analyst Ron Insana on Thursday. In a note to investors, JP Morgan said that Trump’s tariffs had a 40 percent chance of slingshotting the U.S. economy into a recession. JP Morgan underscored that the tariffs would cause a price surge—adding 2 percent to the consumer price index—and additionally raise taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, “the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot,” reported CNN. “The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said, according to CNN. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock.” A judge has ordered the Trump administration to release a man whom it wrongly detained and planned to deport to El Salvador. In a brief one-page filing overnight Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera ordered that the government not only release Adrian Gil Rojas but that it buy him a ticket from Brownsville, Texas, back to New York. “The Court holds that the Petitioner is a Venezuelan national with a valid Temporary Protected Status and was wrongfully detained,” Olvera wrote. “The Court further holds that Respondents produced no evidence that Petitioner is a danger to the public,” he added. The government had argued that it should be allowed to detain and deport Gil Rojas because his TPS was set to expire on April 2, but his lawyer insisted that he was in the process of reopening his immigration case and that there was reason to believe that the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal TPS would fail. The lawyer was right: On Monday, a San Francisco judge blocked the government from revoking the protected status of about 350,000 Venezuelans. Judge Edward Chen slammed Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem for making “sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.” “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen said in his order. Gil Rojas, who said that he was arrested in New York last month, had been one of dozens of Venezuelan nationals detained by ICE who were sneakily moved closer and closer to an airfield in Harlingen, Texas, where the government staged a mass deportation to a notorious torture prison in El Salvador. On March 14, the plane that was supposed to take Gil Rojas suffered a mechanical issue and was rescheduled for the following day, giving his lawyer enough time to get Olvera to issue an order blocking his immediate removal. Gil Rojas was spared, unlike the dozens of others for whom due process was suspended under Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law he has reappropriated to aid in his mass deportation efforts. Olvera said that when Gil Rojas was returned to New York, he should be released on his own recognizance, and recommended that he wear an ankle monitor while his immigration case was pending. Earlier this week, the Trump administration admitted that it had wrongly deported Kilmer Armado Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been granted protected status from being sent back to El Salvador. The government blamed an “administrative error,” and a judge ruled that the man could not be returned to the U.S. because the court lacked jurisdiction now that he was out of U.S. custody. Evidence that the government expedited the deportation of individuals who, as Olvera put it, were not a “danger to the public” only continues to mount. The government revealed that it had heavily relied on the tattoos to identify members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the U.S. government has deemed a terrorist group, for deportation. But experts on the gang say that there are no tattoos that signify TdA affiliation. When Democrats attacked the Trump administration for the gargantuan price of eggs, the administration responded by importing vast quantities from Turkey and South Korea—two countries that were hit hard by the tariffs imposed on Wednesday. When asked about the issue, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had no definitive answer on whether those imported eggs would be tariffed, reinforcing the multiple contradictions at the center of Trump’s isolationist trade war in the process. “President Trump yesterday gave you much praise talking about the job you’ve done in the last month and a half. I wanna talk about what you’ve done with eggs,” Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins on Thursday. “National egg prices have declined 9 percent from last week, now averaging $3 a dozen, according to the USDA. Secretary … are eggs gonna be tariffed?” “Well, so, yeah let’s pivot to eggs.… Listen, we rolled out a very bold plan about a month ago.… Obviously it’s his vision we’re effectuating. The market reacted very favorably to it, [it] included some short-term imports but also included helping our poultry farmers in America,” Rollins answered, avoiding the question. “So as we repopulate our chicken farms and our egg-laying farms, I think we’ll see the price coming down even more.… Only good news on the egg front, and hopefully it will hold.” "Yes, I mean, all to be determined, we're all in negotiations, but yes, that's a possibility" -- Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins can't definitively answer a question about whether imported eggs are being tariffed pic.twitter.com/DeQf55p14J “So where are the eggs coming from that you’re importing?” Bartiromo asked. “Well, we’re importing from Turkey, we’re importing from South Korea, to a few other countries right now,” Rollins responded. “But again, at the end of the day. once our farms are repopulated … then we’ll go back to pretty much using all American-lain eggs.” “So then that means that eggs will be tariffed, if you’re taking them from Turkey, right? That’s part of the tariff plan,” Bartiromo pushed. There will be a 10 percent tariff on Turkey, according to Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement. “Well, yes, all to be determined,” Rollins replied, refusing to commit. ‘We’re all at negotiations, but yes, that’s a possibility.” Lower grocery prices—and lower prices in general—were a central theme of Trump’s campaign. Trump himself riffed on it at his “Liberation Day” announcement. But the new tariffs go directly against those promises, and even his inner circle are struggling to find a way to explain themselves. Got a problem with the Trump administration? Good luck. Recently laid-off employees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were told to contact Anita Pinder, the former director at the agency’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, with any complaints. A notice informed severed workers that they had 45 calendar days to contact Pinder following their termination date, listing Pinder’s name, email, and phone number. But those who knew Pinder said the directive came as a “gut punch,” according to The Washington Post, since Pinder died last year. “They couldn’t have run it past the people at CMS that were at the funeral and knew she died,” Karen Shields, one of Pinder’s former co-workers, told the Post. “This is a lack of communication. There is just a better way to do this.” Shields told the newspaper that it “pained” her to see Pinder’s name used in the reduction-in-force notices. “She would have been someone, even though her job would have been on the chopping block, she would have helped,” Shields said. The negligent error is just one recent instance in which the “shock and awe” of the Trump administration’s federal makeover has resulted in dud details and mass confusion. At the Food and Drug Administration, fired staffers were instructed to contact an Office of Equal Employment Opportunity employee that had left the agency more than a month ago, the Post reported. So far, the Trump administration—directed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency—has fired more than 100,000 federal employees. But tens of thousands more government jobs are expected to be on the chopping block as Trump pursues a second round of “voluntary” buyouts. More than 10,000 jobs are expected to be cut at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed downsizing the agency’s 82,000-person workforce by nearly a quarter. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are much more worried about Social Security and the economy. The poll, which measured opinions from March 3 to March 16, said that concern about the Social Security system is at a 15-year high, with 52 percent of Americans worried about it a “great deal.” Also ranking high were the economy at 60 percent, health care costs at 59 percent, and inflation at 56 percent. The worries reflect the Trump administration’s actions over the past few months, with cuts made to the Social Security Administration and the whiplash over the president’s bizarre tariff decisions. Those fears may get worse, as Trump went ahead with instituting aggressive tariffs against countries across the world on Wednesday, calling it “Liberation Day.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who is overseeing much of the administration’s policy, has called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” Markets have already plummeted Thursday, and criticism of the tariffs have even come within the Republican Party. Cuts to the Social Security Administration threaten to cause interruptions to benefits for 73 million retired workers, their survivors, and poor and disabled Americans. Last month, Martin O’Malley, who headed the SSA under President Biden, warned that the cuts could result in the agency missing payments for the first time in its 80-year history. It’s no surprise that the last time worries about Social Security were this high, the country was in the midst of a recession brought about by the financial crisis of 2008. The difference between now and then is that these worries are brought about by self-inflicted crises. Neither the SSA or the economy were in trouble prior to Trump’s inauguration. If the president continues on its current course, these worries could evolve into full-blown panic over losing Social Security and an even worse recession. The Trump administration is urging nervous voters to “trust” it in response to the impending economic fallout from the President’s tariffs on virtually all foreign imports. “To anyone on Wall Street this morning I would say trust in President Trump,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday morning. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first time. We saw a wages increase, we saw inflation come down. We had a Trump energy boom, we had the largest tax cuts in history, and that’s exactly what the president intends to do.… The United States of America is no longer going to be cheated by foreign nations around the world.” The trade war that the president announced on Wednesday as “Liberation Day” has already tanked the stock market. The country is lurching into a recession, and there is little indication that things will improve anytime soon. Indeed, the tariffs announced on Wednesday are little more than a spiteful policy intended to stick it to friend and foe alike, ostensibly for the purpose of reinvigorating American manufacturing. This is virtually impossible, as these aggressive reciprocal tariffs will most certainly drive up prices for manufacturers and consumers across the country. But the administration would rather have you believe that the economic impact won’t be that bad, or even noticeable. “What can you tell the American people that—they just can’t afford an extra $3 here and there—about the government making up the difference from them?” Lawrence Jones asked Vice President JD Vance on Thursday morning. “Will costs go up at some point, will this just be temporary? Are we talkin’ three months or six months?” “We know a lot of Americans are worried. So we are working very hard to bring prices down,” Vance said. “What I ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not gonna fix things overnight.… We know people are struggling, we’re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us. But it’s not gonna happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost-reducing policies, yes people are gonna see it in their pocketbook, they’re also gonna benefit from the fact that foreign countries can’t take advantage of us anymore, that means their jobs are gonna be more secure.” Neither Vance nor Leavitt actually explain how actions like hitting China with a 34 percent tariff will bring prices down for the everyday American, or how this country will be a self-sufficient producer in just a few years. This backtracking and gaslighting is a far cry from Trump’s promise to “immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.” In the scores of countries hit by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday, one was mysteriously—but not surprisingly—absent: Russia. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios Wednesday that Moscow had been spared from Trump’s tariffs because U.S. sanctions already “preclude any meaningful trade.” Similarly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that it wasn’t necessary to place tariffs on Russia because after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, trade between the U.S. and Russia had effectively dried up. But the claim that the U.S. doesn’t trade with Russia isn’t remotely true. In 2024, the U.S. imported $3 billion worth of goods from Russia, which was down from $4.6 billion the year before. While this number may be small in comparison to key trading partners such as Canada, which imported a whopping $412.7 billion worth of American goods in 2024, it is still significantly more trade than with other countries that Trump levied steep tariffs against. For example, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, a small French island territory off the coast of Canada, was hit with a whopping 50 percent tariff on imports to the U.S. The island, which has a population of roughly 5,000 people, imported only $100,000 worth of U.S. goods in 2024 and exported roughly $3.4 million worth of goods back. If that’s not low enough, Trump even listed several uninhabited islands as receiving a 10 percent tariff on imports to the United States: Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, an Australian territory that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Clearly, a lack of trade was not an actual consideration in the Trump administration’s decision to levy tariffs, though Leavitt claimed that existing sanctions were also why Cuba, Belarus, and North Korea were not included on the list. With Leavitt’s excuse falling flat, it seems increasingly likely that Trump has attempted to carve out a back door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue to do business with the U.S. as it makes an economic enemy out of every other country in the world. Canada and Mexico were also absent from the list because Trump had already hit them with 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports, according to Leavitt. The Trump administration seems to have destroyed global economies overnight while misunderstanding basic economics. In the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement Wednesday, former New Yorker financial writer James Surowiecki pointed out that a column on Trump’s tariff sheet labeled “tariffs charged to the U.S.A.” was likely founded on bad math. “They didn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us,” Surowiecki argued. “So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64 percent, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.” “What extraordinary nonsense this is,” he added. That would mean that the Trump administration imposed earth-shattering tariff hikes on the rest of the world without looking at the whole picture. Mainly, that the administration calculated the tariffs charged by other countries by only looking at goods provided, rather than the combined value of goods and services—something that “most economists seem to think is an odd way to calculate tariffs,” according to BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh. The White House initially refuted the tariff theory. White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai posted on X that “we literally calculated tariff and non tariff barriers.” But in an attempt to prove his point, Desai grabbed a formula from the US Treasury website that actually proved Surowiecki’s. Sardarizadeh broke it down. “∆τᵢ = (x-m) / (ε x φ x m),” he shared. “The formula includes ‘x’ for exports and ‘m’ for imports.” “But it also has ‘ε’ for ‘price elasticity of import demand’, set at 4 by the Treasury; multiplied by ‘φ’ for ‘elasticity of import prices’, set at 0.25 by the Treasury, which means they basically cancel out each other as 4 x 0.25 = 1,” Sardarizadeh continued. “So, in effect, all you’re left with in the formula is exports - imports / imports, which is what X users and journalists had accurately pointed out all along.” But the administration’s bad math only matters so much to the tariff-heavy agenda. Even in countries where the trade deficit was less than 10 percent, or even in countries where there was a surplus, Trump still tacked on a 10 percent tariff. Donald Trump announced a range of tariffs on nearly every country in the world—including, inexplicably, some practically uninhabited islands, one of which is home to a U.S. military base. The British Indian Ocean Territory, a small cluster of islands in the South Indian Ocean, was hit with 10 percent tariffs on U.S. imports from the Trump administration Wednesday as part of its Liberation Day announcement. The islands are mostly uninhabited, save for approximately 3,000 U.S. and U.K. military personnel who are stationed at a joint Navy Support Facility on the island Diego Garcia. Trump’s tariffs would mostly affect the service members there. Another roughly 1,200 people live on the country’s Chagos Archipelago. As one might expect from the name, the territory is owned by the United Kingdom, which Trump hit with a 10 percent tariff, relatively low compared to other countries. Trump also announced 10 percent tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory that was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Australia was saddled with a 10 percent tariff, as well. It’s unclear whether the tariffs on these territories would compound to 20 percent. Crucially, it’s unclear that anyone thought about this at all. Online, some speculated that the tariffs were doled out according to internet domains, and that because the Heart Island and McDonald Islands use a different domain (.hm) than Australia, (.au) they were considered different countries. That seemed to be the only explanation for levying a tariff on a territory that has no economy to speak of. Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that the United States entered the Great Depression as a result of turning its back on the policy of placing tariffs on other countries in favor of an income tax. During a winding speech to mark the so-called Liberation Day, Trump presented an alternative history where steep tariffs, like the ones he’d come to celebrate, could have prevented the worldwide economic disintegration of the early twentieth century. “From 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. was “collecting so much money, so fast, we didn’t know what to do with it! “Then, in 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,” he said. “Then in 1928 it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy; it would have been a much different story,” Trump said. “They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. It was gone. It was too late, nothing could have been done.” Trump’s revisionist history is designed to promote his economic agenda—not reflect what actually happened. Not only could tariffs not have prevented the Great Depression, they made it even worse. In 1913, as the result of struggling farmers and Democrats advocating to establish an income tax, Republicans put up an income tax amendment, hoping that it would be rejected—it wasn’t, and the Sixteenth Amendment became law. At the same time, Congress passed the Underwood Simmons Tariff Act that lowered tariff rates from 40 percent to 27 percent, in a Democrat-backed effort to promote free trade. Crucially, tariffs were raised again in 1921, after Republican President Warren Harding entered the White House and began a reinvigorated era of protectionism. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs in all sectors and is considered to have exacerbated the worldwide economic downturn that lasted from 1929 until 1939, by undermining international trade and affording little protection to domestic producers. Smoot-Hawley was disastrous not only for the U.S. economy, tanking U.S. exports to Europe from $2,341 million in 1929 to just $784 million in 1932, but also for global trade, which declined by a whopping 66 percent between 1929 and 1934, according to the U.S. Office of the Historian. The effects of Smoot-Hawley were so awful that it marked the end of steep tariffs in American trade policy for the rest of the twentieth century. Trump’s baseless insistence that lowered tariffs led to the Great Depression is representative of his entire economic policy, and just how untethered from reality it has become.

Title: Disney, Netflix, AI, More—Newest Winners In Digital Advertising

ByDavid Doty ByDavid Doty, Contributor. The race to digital dominance always has new players The worrisome, repeat noise about the lack of aggressive competition in digital advertising just doesn’t correspond to the reality of the industry. If you follow this column, you’ve know we cover the spectrum of ongoing dynamics in the field. For sure, there are complaints about news outrage fatigue, strangling AI slop, massive layoffs and odd doings at media companies owned loudly or quietly by billionaires (Hello, X, WashPo, LA Times and TIME to name just a few). All the handwringing couldn’t be further from the truth in the real marketplace. A simple step back to look at the big picture shows the entire digital ecosystem is growing at an incredible clip. Massive sums are being invested in AI, with a record, eye-popping $40-billion funding in OpenAI just announced. On the advertising front alone, spending in the U.S. reached $309.3 billion in 2024, a 15.1% increase over 2023, and it is expected to reach $460 billion by 2028. Other industries would kill for that kind of growth. And it’s not exclusily focused on a few, it’s spread among many, and new, players. For sure, the digital ecosystem has and will continue to change—radically. Who’s up, who’s down actually takes a lot of attention to understand. The simplistic view of the industry just isn’t the smart take. We’re all wearing seat belts and goggles as we discover the joys of being crash-test dummies in lightning-speed realignments that used to take years but are now happening in months and weeks (recent case in point: the rapid adoption of generative AI). Digital is hot all over, the state of play is dynamic—and growing like crazy. Disney reports its streaming platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) have an estimated 157 million global monthly active users on ad-supported tiers, including 112 million in the U.S. So, the lesson should be: Despite the influence of any incumbents in the field, new creative players with the right content can get a lot of people not just to watch ads but to opt into watching them. Simultaneously, Netflix, which we should remember started offering ads only two years ago, is projected to top $3.2 billion in ad revenue this year thanks to live sports and events, and more than half of that will come from the U.S. and Canada. Not bad for a nascent part of its business. CTV advertising? Emerging and struggling, some say. But this year it will reach $33.35 billion and is on its way to eclipsing linear TV in 2028. Change sometimes is hard—and then sometimes seems easier than we’d thought it would be. That other new virgorous channel, retail media, is also booming. Total retail media ad impressions surged past 75 billion at the end of 2025. Amazon remains the giant in this space, reporting $56.21 billion in revenue in 2024, and just five years ago that mostly retailer was barely a player in digital ads. Other retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Chewy and Sephora looked around and saw they, too, could compete in the digital advertising game and are now seeing a bigger and bigger share of ad impressions (and ad $$) come their way. There are more interesting fireworks in retail media, too. Despite all the noise about Chinese influence in other place, it turns out that small Chinese sellers make up nearly half of the new sellers added to Walmart’s retail media marketplace, following Amazon’s path (also 50%). With on-again/off-again/on-again/who-knows?again tariffs and how they are reshaping global trade dynamics, much could shift in that landscape and already has: Fast fashion retailer Shein’s profit was down 40% at the end of 2024, threatening the viability of the company’s IPO in 2025 and leaving the opportunity for other retailers to fill the void. Can U.S. domestics slip in to fill any voids–and capture not just the retail revenue but the data dominance? Also gaining ground are new corners of the digital media universe: Trusted recommendations from influencers are an ever-growing force for brands (CMOs, you ignore them at your peril) and the latest consumer powerhouse is communities that let customers talk to peers about products they love (and hate). They are gaining new power in the buying equation. And all that doesn’t even count the unforeseeable but certainly likely incredible speed at which new media can explode onto the scene. Snapchat took almost four years to hit 100 million users. TikTok got there in 9 months. ChatGPT did it in 8 weeks. Threads in 5 days! As I said, the state of play is dynamic and downright … quantum. So don’t believe in the negative or be a skeptic and fatalist: It’s an incredible time to be in the media business—whether you’re creating content, capturing attention, or some mix of both. Your business could be, faster than you know, larger than the largest now. Just look around at what is happening IRL.

Title: Nvidia, TSMC, chip stocks crash as Trump’s new tariffs shake semiconductor industry – How will rising costs and supply chain disruptions impact AI and tech companies?

Following Trump’s announcement, Nvidia stock fell over 5%, while its competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%. Broadcom (AVGO) saw a steep 7% decline, and Micron Technology (MU), a key memory chip supplier for Nvidia’s GPUs, also lost 7% in value. TSMC, the Taiwanese giant responsible for manufacturing advanced semiconductors for companies like Nvidia and Apple (AAPL), also sank approximately 5%. This reaction in the stock market reflects growing fears about supply chain disruptions and cost increases due to new tariff measures. Trump revealed that starting April 5, a 10% baseline tariff would be applied globally. However, from April 9 onward, reciprocal tariffs will be imposed based on individual countries’ trade practices: This move is expected to impact chip imports from these countries, which are major suppliers of AI servers, laptops, and other high-tech products to the U.S. These tariffs directly impact companies like Nvidia, which rely heavily on Taiwan and China for chip manufacturing. TSMC, the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, plays a critical role in producing chips for Nvidia, AMD, and even Intel (INTC). The U.S. imported around $19 billion in servers equipped with Nvidia GPUs from Taiwan and $34 billion from China in 2024, according to trade data compiled by Michigan State University’s supply chain expert Jason Miller. These tariffs will increase costs for U.S. companies relying on these imports, potentially slowing demand for AI chips and computing hardware. Trump has positioned these tariffs as a way to push companies to manufacture their chips in the U.S. He pointed to TSMC’s $100 billion investment in Arizona, an expansion that started under the Biden administration with support from the U.S. Chips and Science Act. However, industry experts are skeptical. Truist analyst William Stein surveyed 10 semiconductor manufacturers and distributors, and none indicated plans to move operations to the U.S. in response to these tariffs. One respondent even suggested that companies are avoiding major investments in new locations because they doubt these tariffs will be permanent. Despite the immediate stock drop, some analysts believe AI chipmakers like Nvidia may weather the storm better than others. Stein noted that AI companies are in an aggressive race to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) at almost any cost, meaning demand for Nvidia’s GPUs may remain strong despite higher prices. However, long-term impacts remain uncertain. If these tariffs stay in place, they could lead to increased costs for U.S. tech companies, potential supply chain restructuring, and shifts in global chip manufacturing strategies. For now, investors and industry leaders will be closely watching how these tariffs unfold and whether further trade actions follow.

Title: Apple has its biggest stock drop in five years because of Trump’s tariffs

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. by Todd Haselton Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening. Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent. Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced. The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products. Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

Apple (AAPL-3.08%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN-1.06%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META-0.03%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA+1.18%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-2.17%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL-0.18%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT+0.50%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-1.28%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. by Todd Haselton Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening. Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent. Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced. The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products. Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

Title: Outsmarting The System: White Fonting, Fake Reviews, And Résumé Hacks

ByDr. Diane Hamilton ByDr. Diane Hamilton, Contributor. Outsmarting The System: White Fonting, Fake Reviews, And Résumé Hacks Never underestimate people’s ability to get creative. Job seekers are adding invisible keywords to résumés to beat applicant tracking systems. Students are using AI tools like ChatGPT to rewrite essays in ways traditional plagiarism detectors cannot always catch. Amazon sellers are inflating ratings with fake reviews, and content creators are joining engagement pods to fool social media algorithms. Across industries, individuals are finding ways to get past automated filters, strict systems, and rigid evaluation processes. In many cases, it is about outsmarting processes that feel impossible to navigate fairly. What may seem like manipulation often reflects frustration, curiosity, and a desire to be seen. From white fonting to résumé rewriting to gaming content platforms, these behaviors raise bigger questions. If people are constantly outsmarting the system, what does that say about the system itself? And what can leaders, hiring teams, and educators learn from these increasingly common tactics? What Is White Fonting And Why Are Job Seekers Outsmarting The System? White fonting is a résumé trick where applicants insert key phrases in white text so they are invisible to human readers but still readable by applicant tracking systems. A candidate applying for a marketing role might hide words like HubSpot, content strategy, or Google Ads throughout their document even if they lack those skills. The goal is to bypass keyword filters and get a shot at an interview. While it may seem dishonest, many job seekers using white fonting do not see it that way. They are trying to be noticed in a system that feels too automated, too rigid, and too competitive. For them, outsmarting the résumé filter is more of a survival skill than a scam. Do Résumé Hacks Still Work When Outsmarting AI Filters? Résumé hacks like white fonting, keyword stuffing, and AI-generated job applications can still work in some cases. In addition to hiding text, job seekers may repeat desirable phrases or inflate their job titles to appear more qualified. However, today’s applicant tracking systems are more sophisticated. Many strip formatting, detect excessive repetition, and flag suspicious content. Outsmarting the AI might work once, but it can also backfire if a recruiter notices inconsistencies or patterns that look inauthentic. What is more telling is why candidates feel they have to use these tactics in the first place. In a process designed to automate decisions, standing out as a human is becoming harder. How Students Have Been Outsmarting Plagiarism Detectors For Years Before white fonting showed up in résumés, I had already seen similar tactics in education. Some of my own students told me they used to wrap copied text in white quotation marks to get around plagiarism software. These days, it's more likely they’re using ChatGPT to rewrite their papers. But getting around the system isn’t new. Students have found ways to outsource their work for years. I once had a student submit a paper that included the following at the bottom, something she clearly forgot to delete: “Thank you for purchasing this paper. That will be fifteen dollars.” I believe the price has gone up since then. While those kinds of shortcuts were easier to spot, the tools students use now are more sophisticated. Grammarly, for example, was widely recommended as a writing aid, and many schools encouraged its use. But now it sometimes gets flagged in AI detection reports. What was once a tool to support learning might now complicate things. Whether it is helpful or harmful often depends on the intent behind it and the system doing the reviewing. Detection tools have gotten better at spotting tricks by looking at context and removing formatting. But the bigger issue is still there. When students believe the system is more focused on catching them than helping them learn, they will always find a way around it. Other Ways People Are Outsmarting Digital Systems The same mindset driving white fonting and AI-written essays shows up across nearly every platform. Social media influencers use engagement pods to artificially boost visibility. Sellers use brushing scams and fake reviews to rank higher on e-commerce sites. SEO specialists use keyword stuffing and cloaked pages to rise in search rankings. Test takers use screen mirroring, hidden devices, or even fake webcam movement to fool remote proctoring. Outsmarting the system has become a skill. But it is often a response to the feeling that the system itself is no longer working for the individual. Still, it raises a fair question. If people spent as much time doing the work as they do trying to get around it, wouldn’t that be more productive? Maybe. But when someone feels the odds are stacked against them, working around the system can feel like the only way forward. Why Outsmarting The System Happens In The First Place This behavior is not always about deception. More often, it is about frustration. People feel unseen by machines and blocked by rules they do not understand. They want in but do not know how to navigate the filters standing in the way. There is something deeper too. People are naturally curious. They test boundaries, push limits, and explore loopholes not always to break the rules but to understand them. Outsmarting is not always defiance. Sometimes it is innovation. Is Outsmarting The System Always Cheating? White fonting and similar behaviors fall on a spectrum. Sometimes they are clever ways to gain visibility. Other times they cross the line into deception. But if people are bending the rules just to be considered fairly, it may be time to examine the rules themselves. For job seekers, students, and creators, the issue is often not about ethics but about access. They are asking how else they can get a chance. How HR Professionals Can Respond To People Outsmarting The Hiring Process Rather than punish manipulation, HR teams should examine what is driving it. If people are outsmarting your hiring process, that is a signal. It means the process is perceived as unfair, overly filtered, or too impersonal. Here is what organizations can do: The best candidates may not always look perfect on paper. Sometimes, the most valuable hires are the ones trying the hardest to be seen. How Former Employees Are Outsmarting Company Reputation Systems The same mindset of outsmarting applies to company review sites. Some former employees have found ways to manipulate platforms like Glassdoor to damage an employer’s reputation. Tactics include mass posting negative reviews under multiple fake accounts, copy-pasting slightly altered feedback to create volume, or coordinating group efforts to flood a company’s page. Others wait for news of layoffs or leadership changes and time their reviews for maximum visibility. While Glassdoor uses fraud detection tools to identify suspicious content, no system is perfect. Some coordinated attacks can still get through. These actions are attempts to outsmart a system that may feel like the only way to hold a company accountable. For HR leaders and executives, these incidents are a reminder that reputation systems must be monitored, but they must also be trusted enough not to invite sabotage. What Outsmarting The System Says About Organizational Culture If people feel they need to cheat your system, the system may be part of the problem. White fonting, fake reviews, AI-generated content, and even coordinated review attacks all stem from environments where trust in the process has broken down. Instead of reinforcing complexity, organizations should examine what is encouraging these behaviors in the first place. Outsmarting the systems provides feedback. People are still trying. They want in. They are just not convinced that playing by the rules will work. The Real Question Behind Outsmarting The System Most people do not try to outsmart systems they trust. If outsmarting the system is happening everywhere, from classrooms to job boards to e-commerce platforms, it deserves serious attention. I once interviewed Dr. John Kotter, a renowned Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School and a leading expert on leadership and change. His work on resistance is especially relevant in this context because when people do not feel empowered within a system, they often look for ways to work around it. They are not necessarily resisting the outcome but rather the structure that feels unfair or unyielding. The future of work will increasingly depend on automation and algorithms, but it must also allow space for trust, transparency, and human creativity. If someone is trying to outsmart your system, the more important question is not how to stop them but what their actions are revealing about the system itself. Outsmarting the system is not going away, but there is an opportunity to design systems that are strong, fair, and human in ways that reduce the desire to bypass them.

Title: Will Trump's New Tariffs Drive Up Headset Prices In The US?

With a 54% tariff set to apply to Chinese-made goods and 46% for Vietnam, will the price of VR headsets in the US soon increase? Enacted by President Trump via executive order yesterday, the new import tariffs are set to take effect from April 9, next Wednesday. They apply to goods manufactured in these countries, not just sold by companies from them. And while there are some exemptions, VR headsets aren't on that list. Most headsets today, including Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, PlayStation VR2, and Pico, are made in either China, Vietnam, or both. While Trump had already placed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports in recent months, headset companies could plausibly absorb these added costs, and he hadn't yet applied a tariff to electronics made in Vietnam. But with tariffs moving to 54% and 46% for China and Vietnam respectively, it seems very unlikely that most headset companies will be able to avoid increasing prices. For example, analyst estimates placed the cost to Meta of each Quest 3 at around $430, excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus the new tariffs should bring this to around $650, significantly higher than its current $500 price. Could we soon see a $700 Quest 3, $500 Quest 3S, and PlayStation VR2 move back to $550? Even the US-assembled Bigscreen Beyond 2 would feel the heat from the tariffs. Most of its components, such as its expensive micro-OLED displays from China, would be affected. And this cost would almost certainly need to be passed on to the buyer. Meta has been moving around half of Quest production to Vietnam, to avoid the tariffs Trump was expected to place on China. But with Vietnam hit too, this diversification won't make a major difference. Not every company will necessarily need to increase prices, though. The same analyst estimates place the cost to Apple of each Vision Pro at around $1700, also excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus Apple could still be making an acceptable profit even if the cost soon rises to around $2500. Consumer hardware companies typically build up large stock pools in each country they sell in, so we're not expecting to see Quest and PS VR2 prices suddenly jump next week. But eventually the US stock of these headsets will run out. And when new units are coming in at around 50% higher cost, how could the current US prices hold? Of course, it's possible that President Trump scales back or cancels these tariffs entirely by then. Trump's administration has described tariffs as a mechanism of putting pressure on countries to make certain policy changes, and perhaps the US president decides his aims have been satisfied before US headset stockpiles run out. The rapidly shifting global political landscape makes definitive predictions here impossible, so we'll be keeping a close eye on the situation over the coming weeks and months.

Title: Stocks tumble after Trump's tariff reveal, with Dow set to shed 1,000 points

Markets plummeted Thursday in the wake of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%, with the damage extending to most industries on the prospects of stagflation — that is, slower economic growth accompanied by faster inflation. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8% and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 6%, making Thursday the market’s worst day for stocks in five years. Airlines, retailers and big banks took big hits, with some healthcare companies among the few gainers. For the Magnificent 7, declines were 9.3% for Apple (AAPL-3.08%), 9% for Amazon (AMZN-1.06%), 9% for Meta (META-0.03%), 5.5% for Tesla (TSLA-2.17%), 7.8% for Nvidia (NVDA+1.18%), 2.4% for Microsoft (MSFT+0.50%), and 3.9% for Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL-0.18%). Big Tech will be vulnerable to retaliation by the European Union. “Trump’s tariff plan probably represents a shift for markets to quickly move from max uncertainty to max pessimism, although if countries retaliate — and Europe and China are talking like they will — rates could go up even further and drive another leg down for markets,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial (LPLA+0.73%). Buchbinder expects stocks to stabilize provided negotiations bear fruit and take tariff rates down, assuming markets are assured that no meaningful tariff rates will be increased because of retaliation, he wrote in an email distributed to the media. Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), isn’t so sanguine as she expects the levies to actually go into effect as announced. “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk,” she told Quartz on Wednesday after the news. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Trump showed no signs of backing down on Thursday, saying, “It’s going very well,” comparing the imposition of tariffs to surgery, and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. The president’s early claims that the import taxes will bring back jobs is debatable, and duties have a poor historical track record of boosting manufacturing employment. The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the EU will be slapped with 20%. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. The large tariffs on Asian countries will weigh heavily on shoe and apparel makers, which do much of their manufacturing in the region. Shares of Nike (NKE-3.17%) plunged 14%, while those of Lululemon (LULU-6.22%) plummeted 9.6%, and those of Uggs- and Hoka-maker Deckers (DECK-2.81%) tumbled 14%. Restoration Hardware’s parent RH (RH-8.85%) tumbled 40% on Thursday on a double whammy of earnings and tariffs. Williams-Sonoma (WSM-3.59%) plunged 16%, and at the other end of the retail spectrum Dollar Tree (DLTR-2.58%) fell 13%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. General Motors (GM-1.75%), Ford (F-4.98%) and Stellantis (STLA-6.48%) nonetheless extended their declines — by 4.3%, 5.9% and 9.4%, respectively — as Canada retaliated in kind for Trump’s new 25% tariffs on cars and trucks. “The tariff announcement was intended to give clarity on tariff policy,” Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at Cornell University, said via an email sent to the media. “Unfortunately, it has created more questions and confusion.” Stellantis has already suspended plants in Canada and Mexico, he added. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free from China. The shares of PDD (PDD-4.80%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.5%. The the stock market — and the economy — isn’t certain to get help from the Federal Reserve in the form of an interest rate cut, given that the import taxes will probably both boost inflation and weigh on GDP growth. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will prioritize prices or full employment. Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million.The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by more than expected. Yardeni Research projected that PCED inflation will accelerate to 3% to 4% over the rest of this year, with the potential for a quick deterioration of the labor market. If stagflation sets in, the firm expects it to last six months to a year. “The worst-case scenario is a recession if high tariff rates stick, leading to a slowdown in business and consumer spending that cause layoffs,” the firm wrote in a QuickTakes note. “We raised our odds of a stagflation/recession scenario from 35% to 45% on Monday.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: How and where Trump's new tariffs affect Apple

AAPL: 173.12 ( 8.34 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Donald Trump's signed tariff plan - Photo credit CNBC Last updated 5 days ago President Trump's new tariffs go far beyond China, and hit every nation in the world. Here's how badly Apple has been hit, and where it has been struck globally. In February 2025, the Bank of America said that the impact of tariffs on Apple would be significant. Before the extent of the tariffs were announced, Bank of America estimated that they would mean Apple may have to raise iPhone prices by 10%. Apple has yet to make any announcements about price changes. It might have attempted to swallow small increases in component costs, but it is unlikely to absorb these massive ones. The company has previously made a point of how it has kept the iPhone costs the same for years — although only in the US. That means it has borne at least some inflation costs mostly because of smart buys of commodities like DRAM and NAND, and also any added expense of new technologies being added to the iPhone. But those costs will continue to rise anyway, and the addition of tariffs may mean even Apple cannot avoid raising its prices. Previously Apple was able to negotiate a tariff exemption during President Trump's first term, but as yet it has failed to do so again. So at present, Apple will have to pay the tariffs on everything it imports into the US. And, there is some double-dipping involved, perhaps. An iPad assembled in Vietnam will also incur a cost for having a processor manufactured in Taiwan. It should be clear that a TSMC processor made in Arizona would face no tariff, but materials imported to make those chips will be impacted. And, for now, it appears those chips are completed in TSMC's facilities in Taiwan, at least until the AMKOR finishing plant comes completely on line. Taking each country's tariffs separately, though, this is what CNBC says Apple now has to pay for devices or components from each of its biggest supply regions. ChinaChina currently accounts for: 80% of Apple's whole production capacity Assembly of 90% of all iPhones Assembly of 55% of Macs Assembly of 80% of iPads Overall, it's estimated that around 40% of all of Apple's suppliers are based in China. Tariffs that Apple will have to pay to import goods from these suppliers are immediately set to 34%. IndiaCurrently India assembles approximately 10% to 15% of iPhones, but has been expected to reach up to 20% by the end of 2025, helped by the country cutting import taxes for Apple and others. Apple is now required to pay a tariff of 26% on imports from India. VietnamVietnam has benefited from an increase in investment from Apple, partly to avoid the expected tariffs, and partly to avoid overall US/China trade tensions. It has also been intended to reduce Apple's over-dependence on China as a single supply source. Now, however, Apple will have to pay an import tariff of 46%. This will affect: Assembly of 20% of iPads Assembly of 90% of Apple Watch Other major countriesApple produces some Macs in Thailand, which now has a 36% tariff. Malaysia also manufacturers the Mac, and is facing a 25% tariff. The vast majority of processors in all Apple devices, though, are manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC. And imports to the US from Taiwan now have a 32% tariff. The impact on Apple, and market sentimentAnalysts are starting to chime in on what they expect to see from these tariffs. Krish Sankar from TD Cowen believes that US sales account for about 31% of total revenues with about 75% coming from hardware products. He estimates that every 10% of tariffs would impact Apple's net income by about 3.5% in FY25 and FY26 EPS. He also estimates that Apple will raise prices to offset tariffs, and estimates that every 10% of tariffs levied can be offset by an about 6% increase in product average selling price. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan has also come up with the 6% figure. Analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush calls the tariff plan "illogical," and "economic Armageddon" for the global economy, and specifically, the American consumer. Ives reiterates that when other countries are hit with tariffs, it's ultimately the American consumer that bears the entire brunt of the bill. He still considers Apple a focus to own in a stock portfolio, but is expecting to see at least in the short term a 10% hit. Trump's new tariffs immediately caused stocks in technology firms to fall. Apple saw the largest drop of any technology firm. Apple's stocks fell almost 7.5% in extended trading as of 8 AM Eastern Time on April 3. It's not clear what the market sentiment will be when the market opens. In comparison, Nvidia's shares dropped 4%, while Tesla lost approximately 4.5%. Amazon, Meta, and Google parent company Alphabet all lost between 2.5% and 5%, while Microsoft is down almost 2%. Unless Apple stocks rebound during regular trading, this fall is the company's worst since September 2020. That was when the iPhone 12 launch was delayed because of COVID disruption. In February 2025, the Bank of America said that the impact of tariffs on Apple would be significant. Before the extent of the tariffs were announced, Bank of America estimated that they would mean Apple may have to raise iPhone prices by 10%.

And, for now, it appears those chips are completed in TSMC's facilities in Taiwan, at least until the AMKOR finishing plant comes completely on line. Taking each country's tariffs separately, though, this is what CNBC says Apple now has to pay for devices or components from each of its biggest supply regions. China currently accounts for: Overall, it's estimated that around 40% of all of Apple's suppliers are based in China. Tariffs that Apple will have to pay to import goods from these suppliers are immediately set to 34%. Currently India assembles approximately 10% to 15% of iPhones, but has been expected to reach up to 20% by the end of 2025, helped by the country cutting import taxes for Apple and others. Apple is now required to pay a tariff of 26% on imports from India. Vietnam has benefited from an increase in investment from Apple, partly to avoid the expected tariffs, and partly to avoid overall US/China trade tensions. It has also been intended to reduce Apple's over-dependence on China as a single supply source. Now, however, Apple will have to pay an import tariff of 46%. This will affect: Apple produces some Macs in Thailand, which now has a 36% tariff. Malaysia also manufacturers the Mac, and is facing a 25% tariff. The vast majority of processors in all Apple devices, though, are manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC. And imports to the US from Taiwan now have a 32% tariff. Analysts are starting to chime in on what they expect to see from these tariffs. Krish Sankar from TD Cowen believes that US sales account for about 31% of total revenues with about 75% coming from hardware products. He estimates that every 10% of tariffs would impact Apple's net income by about 3.5% in FY25 and FY26 EPS. He also estimates that Apple will raise prices to offset tariffs, and estimates that every 10% of tariffs levied can be offset by an about 6% increase in product average selling price. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan has also come up with the 6% figure. Analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush calls the tariff plan "illogical," and "economic Armageddon" for the global economy, and specifically, the American consumer. Ives reiterates that when other countries are hit with tariffs, it's ultimately the American consumer that bears the entire brunt of the bill. He still considers Apple a focus to own in a stock portfolio, but is expecting to see at least in the short term a 10% hit. Trump's new tariffs immediately caused stocks in technology firms to fall. Apple saw the largest drop of any technology firm. Apple's stocks fell almost 7.5% in extended trading as of 8 AM Eastern Time on April 3. It's not clear what the market sentiment will be when the market opens. In comparison, Nvidia's shares dropped 4%, while Tesla lost approximately 4.5%. Amazon, Meta, and Google parent company Alphabet all lost between 2.5% and 5%, while Microsoft is down almost 2%. Unless Apple stocks rebound during regular trading, this fall is the company's worst since September 2020. That was when the iPhone 12 launch was delayed because of COVID disruption. I still can’t believe people voted for this moron. It’s sad to see the pathetic joke this once great country has become. I still can’t believe people voted for this moron.

So much for a certain person donating a cool million to a certain persons fund and being welcomed into the "tent" and kissing the ring.

Looks like T.C got the short end of the stick even with TSMC build a fab for processors. Doesn’t the US hardware account for only 20% of eps? Services which is about 35% of eps has no tariff. If Apple meets in the middle and absorbs half the tariff say 15-20% won’t it only be an impact of like 6-7% on eps? Doesn’t the US hardware account for only 20% of eps?

Didn't president "bone spurs" kill the CHIPS act signed by Biden that was to bring some microprocessor manufacturing back to the US?Is that plant still going on line in Arizona?Edit: Forget my question about the plant in Arizona. It's already on line as stated by Appleinsider back in January 8. Malcolm Owen's article --> TSMC's Arizona plant starts making a second Apple chip Didn't president "bone spurs" kill the CHIPS act signed by Biden that was to bring some microprocessor manufacturing back to the US? Maybe I’m missing something but Tim meeting with Trump and in Feb and then both announcing the 500b US investment has total exemption written all over it. Again am I missing something? Would welcome comments. Maybe I’m missing something but Tim meeting with Trump and in Feb and then both announcing the 500b US investment has total exemption written all over it. Again am I missing something? Would welcome comments. Apple's Mac sales are rising sharply just as Trump's tariffs guarantee that the the global PC market will have one of its most unpredictable years ever. The Asahi Linux project is having trouble bringing the operating system to M4 Macs, with some chip changes making working with the latest Apple Silicon models a lot tougher. Apple Arcade is set to see five new games roll out this May, including a new entry into the "What the" series and a new Lego endless racer. Built with Thunderbolt connectivity and tuned for macOS, QNAP's latest network attached storage devices are tailor-made for multiple Final Cut editors and creative pros. Earnings for what may be Apple's last quarter without massive tariffs, that saw releases of iPhone 16e, updated Macs, and new iPads will be announced on May 1, followed by a conference call. Apple Vision Pro introduced new ways of controlling apps through gestures, but it appears that Apple wants to extend that to controlling any device it makes. A questionably sourced report claims a new version of the Apple Vision Pro is in mass production now, with the new model supposedly going on sale within a year. A social media post has gone viral with the claim that Apple will be releasing emojis of major pop stars as part of iOS 18.5. The only problem is, the prediction is complete crap. Apple and Michigan State University are opening a free manufacturing training academy in Detroit to help U.S. suppliers modernize their operations. Ming-Chi Kuo's Apple commentary is normally fairly insightful, but his latest batch on how Apple can shoulder President Trump's tariff burden is short-sighted, and doesn't make a great deal of sense. The Keychron Q3 HE is a great compact mechanical keyboard, one that offers lots of customization thanks to its Hall Effect switches.

Investors weren’t happy with President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, sending stocks plunging. The S&P 500 fell 4% at 10:14 a.m., the Nasdaq composite declined 5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.7%, or 1,556 points. For the Magnificent 7, declines in pre-market trading were 7.5% for Apple (AAPL-3.08%), 6.3% for Amazon (AMZN-1.06%), 4.7% for Meta (META-0.03%), 6.1% for Tesla (TSLA-2.17%), 5.7% for Nvidia (NVDA+1.18%), 2.8% for Microsoft (MSFT+0.50%), and 3% for Google’s (GOOGL-0.18%) parent Alphabet. The import taxes will be applied on a country-by-country basis. Chinese goods, for example, will be hit with a 34% levy, while products from the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties. Mexican and Canadian goods won’t face any additional charges. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Melisa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%), told Quartz. The tariffs are “not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million. The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by much more than expected for March to 50.8 from 53.5 in February, with the new orders measure dropping to 50.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. More stocks to watch today: Constellation Brands (STZ-0.12%), which makes, imports and distributes alcoholic beverages, is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. Revenue and per-share profit may have been little changed from a year earlier. The stock fell 0.6%. General Motors (GM-1.75%) stock dropped 3% after Trump confirmed that 25% duties on cars, trucks and autoparts will go into place as planned. Stellantis (STLA-6.48%) fell 5.1%, and Ford (F-4.98%) slid 2.7%. Trump had announced the auto tariffs earlier, and refrained from imposing additional tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Nike’s (NKE-3.17%) stock plunged 13% because the shoemaker’s contract factories abroad in countries including Vietnam and China will face much higher tariffs. Apparel maker Lululemon (LULU-6.22%) and Deckers (DECK-2.81%) Outdoor, which makes the Hoka and Teva brands, fell 13% and 17%, respectively for the same reason. PDD (PDD-4.80%) stock fell 4.3%. The company’s Temu shopping website will be affected by the end of the de minimis exemption that allows low-value packages to be sent from China duty free.

Our monetary policy strategy, the tools we use and the impact they have Insights into our work on financial stability and payments and market infrastructures Access to all ECB statistics and background information All you need to know about our common currency In-depth studies and expert analyses covering diverse topics and fields 3 April 2025 Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that, since the Governing Council's previous monetary policy meeting on 29-30 January 2025, euro area and US markets had moved in opposite directions in a highly volatile political environment. In the euro area, markets had focused on the near-term macroeconomic backdrop, with incoming data in the euro area surprising on the upside. Lower energy prices responding in part to the prospect of a ceasefire in Ukraine, looser fiscal policy due to increased defence spending and a potential relaxation of Germany’s fiscal rules had supported investor sentiment. This contrasted with developments in the United States, where market participants’ assessment of the new US Administration’s policy decisions had turned more negative amid fears of tariffs driving prices up and dampening consumer and business sentiment. A puzzling feature of recent market developments had been the dichotomy between measures of policy uncertainty and financial market volatility. Global economic policy uncertainty had shot up in the final quarter of 2024 and had reached a new all-time high, surpassing the peak seen at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. By contrast, volatility in euro area and US equity markets had remained muted, despite having broadly traced dynamics in economic policy uncertainty over the past 15 years. Only more recently, with the prospect of tariffs becoming more concrete, had stock market volatility started to pick up from low levels. Risk sentiment in the euro area remained strong and close to all-time highs, outpacing the United States, which had declined significantly since the Governing Council's January monetary policy meeting. This mirrored the divergence of macroeconomic developments. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the euro area had turned positive in February 2025, reaching its highest level since April 2024. This was in contrast to developments in the United States, where economic surprises had been negative recently. The divergence in investor appetite was most evident in stock markets. The euro area stock market continued to outperform its US counterpart, posting the strongest year-to-date performance relative to the US index in almost a decade. Stock market developments were aligned with analysts’ earnings expectations, which had been raised for European firms since the start of 2025. Meanwhile, US earnings estimates had been revised down continuously for the past eleven weeks. Part of the recent outperformance of euro area equities stemmed from a catch-up in valuations given that euro area equities had performed less strongly than US stocks in 2024. Moreover, in spite of looming tariffs, the euro area equity market was benefiting from potential growth tailwinds, including a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, the greater prospect of a stable German government following the country’s parliamentary elections and the likelihood of increased defence spending in the euro area. The share prices of tariff-sensitive companies had been significantly underperforming their respective benchmarks in both currency areas, but tariff-sensitive stocks in the United States had fared substantially worse. Market pricing also indicated a growing divergence in inflation prospects between the euro area and the United States. In the euro area, the market’s view of a gradual disinflation towards the ECB’s 2% target remained intact. One-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead stood at around 2%, while the one-year forward inflation-linked swap rate one year ahead continued to stand somewhat below 2%. However, inflation compensation had moved up across maturities on 5 March 2025. In the United States, one-year forward inflation compensation one year ahead had increased significantly, likely driven in part by bond traders pricing in the inflationary effects of tariffs on US consumer prices. Indicators of the balance of risks for inflation suggested that financial market participants continued to see inflation risks in the euro area as broadly balanced across maturities. Changing growth and inflation prospects had also been reflected in monetary policy expectations for the euro area. On the back of slightly lower inflation compensation due to lower energy prices, expectations for ECB monetary policy had edged down. A 25 basis point cut was fully priced in for the current Governing Council monetary policy meeting, while markets saw a further rate cut at the following meeting as uncertain. Most recently, at the time of the meeting, rate investors no longer expected three more 25 basis point cuts in the deposit facility rate in 2025. Participants in the Survey of Monetary Analysts, finalised in the last week of February, had continued to expect a slightly faster easing cycle. Turning to euro area market interest rates, the rise in nominal ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates since the 11-12 December 2024 Governing Council meeting had largely been driven by improving euro area macroeconomic data, while the impact of US factors had been small overall. Looking back, euro area ten-year nominal and real OIS rates had overall been remarkably stable since their massive repricing in 2022, when the ECB had embarked on the hiking cycle. A key driver of persistently higher long-term rates had been the market’s reassessment of the real short-term rate that was expected to prevail in the future. The expected real one-year forward rate four years ahead had surged in 2022 as investors adjusted their expectations away from a “low-for-long” interest rate environment, suggesting that higher real rates were expected to be the new normal. The strong risk sentiment had also been transmitted to euro area sovereign bond spreads relative to yields on German government bonds, which remained at contained levels. Relative to OIS rates, however, the spreads had increased since the January monetary policy meeting – this upward move intensified on 5 March with the expectation of a substantial increase in defence spending. One factor behind the gradual widening of asset swap spreads over the past two years had been the increasing net supply of government bonds, which had been smoothly absorbed in the market. Regarding the exchange rate, after a temporary depreciation the euro had appreciated slightly against the US dollar, going above the level seen at the time of the January meeting. While the repricing of expectations regarding ECB monetary policy relative to the United States had weighed on the euro, as had global risk sentiment, the euro had been supported by the relatively stronger euro area economic outlook. Ms Schnabel then considered the implications of recent market developments for overall financial conditions. Since the Governing Council's previous monetary policy meeting, a broad-based and pronounced easing in financial conditions had been observed. This was driven primarily by higher equity prices and, to a lesser extent, by lower interest rates. The decline in euro area real risk-free interest rates across the yield curve implied that the euro area real yield curve remained well within neutral territory. Mr Lane started his introduction by noting that, according to Eurostat’s flash release, headline inflation in the euro area had declined to 2.4% in February, from 2.5% in January. While energy inflation had fallen from 1.9% to 0.2% and services inflation had eased from 3.9% to 3.7%, food inflation had increased to 2.7%, from 2.3%, and non-energy industrial goods inflation had edged up from 0.5% to 0.6%. Most indicators of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. The Persistent and Common Component of Inflation had ticked down to 2.1% in January. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined by 0.2 percentage points to 4.0%. But it remained high, as wages and some services prices were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. Recent wage negotiations pointed to a continued moderation in labour cost pressures. For instance, negotiated wage growth had decreased to 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The wage tracker and an array of survey indicators also suggested a continued weakening of wage pressures in 2025. Inflation was expected to evolve along a slightly higher path in 2025 than had been expected in the Eurosystem staff’s December projections, owing to higher energy prices. At the same time, services inflation was expected to continue declining in early 2025 as the effects from lagged repricing faded, wage pressures receded and the impact of past monetary policy tightening continued to feed through. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations still stood at around 2%. Near-term market-based inflation compensation had declined across maturities, likely reflecting the most recent decline in energy prices, but longer-term inflation compensation had recently increased in response to emerging fiscal developments. Consumer inflation expectations had resumed their downward momentum in January. According to the March ECB staff projections, headline inflation was expected to average 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. Compared with the December 2024 projections, inflation had been revised up by 0.2 percentage points for 2025, reflecting stronger energy price dynamics in the near term. At the same time, the projections were unchanged for 2026 and had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2027. For core inflation, staff projected a slowdown from an average of 2.2% in 2025 to 2.0% in 2026 and to 1.9% in 2027 as labour cost pressures eased further, the impact of past shocks faded and the past monetary policy tightening continued to weigh on prices. The core inflation projection was 0.1 percentage points lower for 2025 compared with the December projections round, as recent data releases had surprised on the downside, but they had been revised up by the same amount for 2026, reflecting the lagged indirect effects of the past depreciation of the euro as well as higher energy inflation in 2025. Geopolitical uncertainties loomed over the global growth outlook. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for global composite output excluding the euro area had declined in January to 52.0, amid a broad-based slowdown in the services sector across key economies. The discussions between the United States and Russia over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as the de-escalation in the Middle East, had likely contributed to the recent decline in oil and gas prices on global commodity markets. Nevertheless, geopolitical tensions remained a major source of uncertainty. Euro area foreign demand growth was projected to moderate, declining from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and then to 3.1% in 2026 and 2027. Downward revisions to the projections for global trade compared with the December 2024 projections reflected mostly the impact of tariffs on US imports from China. The euro had remained stable in nominal effective terms and had appreciated against the US dollar since the last monetary policy meeting. From the start of the easing cycle last summer, the euro had depreciated overall both against the US dollar and in nominal effective terms, albeit showing a lot of volatility in the high frequency data. Energy commodity prices had decreased following the January meeting, with oil prices down by 4.6% and gas prices down by 12%. However, energy markets had also seen a lot of volatility recently. Turning to activity in the euro area, GDP had grown modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024. Manufacturing was still a drag on growth, as industrial activity remained weak in the winter months and stood below its third-quarter level. At the same time, survey indicators for manufacturing had been improving and indicators for activity in the services sector were moderating, while remaining in expansionary territory. Although growth in domestic demand had slowed in the fourth quarter, it remained clearly positive. In contrast, exports had likely continued to contract in the fourth quarter. Survey data pointed to modest growth momentum in the first quarter of 2025. The composite output PMI had stood at 50.2 in February, unchanged from January and up from an average of 49.3 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The PMI for manufacturing output had risen to a nine-month high of 48.9, whereas the PMI for services business activity had been 50.6, remaining in expansionary territory but at its lowest level for a year. The more forward-looking composite PMI for new orders had edged down slightly in February owing to its services component. The European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator had improved in January and February but remained well below its long-term average. The labour market remained robust. Employment had increased by 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate had stayed at its historical low of 6.2% in January. However, demand for labour had moderated, which was reflected in fewer job postings, fewer job-to-job transitions and declining quit intentions for wage or career reasons. Recent survey data suggested that employment growth had been subdued in the first two months of 2025. In terms of fiscal policy, a tightening of 0.9 percentage points of GDP had been achieved in 2024, mainly because of the reversal of inflation compensatory measures and subsidies. In the March projections a further slight tightening was foreseen for 2025, but this did not yet factor in the news received earlier in the week about the scaling-up of defence spending. Looking ahead, growth should be supported by higher incomes and lower borrowing costs. According to the staff projections, exports should also be boosted by rising global demand as long as trade tensions did not escalate further. But uncertainty had increased and was likely to weigh on investment and exports more than previously expected. Consequently, ECB staff had again revised down growth projections, by 0.2 percentage points to 0.9% for 2025 and by 0.2 percentage points to 1.2% for 2026, while keeping the projection for 2027 unchanged at 1.3%. Respondents to the Survey of Monetary Analysts expected growth of 0.8% in 2025, 0.2 percentage points lower than in January, but continued to expect growth of 1.1% in 2026 and 1.2% in 2027, unchanged from January. Market interest rates in the euro area had decreased after the January meeting but had risen over recent days in response to the latest fiscal developments. The past interest rate cuts, together with anticipated future cuts, were making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households, and loan growth was picking up. At the same time, a headwind to the easing of financing conditions was coming from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remained subdued overall. The cost of new loans to firms had declined further by 12 basis points to 4.2% in January, about 1 percentage point below the October 2023 peak. By contrast, the cost of issuing market-based corporate debt had risen to 3.7%, 0.2 percentage points higher than in December. Mortgage rates were 14 basis points lower at 3.3% in January, around 80 basis points below their November 2023 peak. However, the average cost of bank credit measured on the outstanding stock of loans had declined substantially less than that of new loans to firms and only marginally for mortgages. Annual growth in bank lending to firms had risen to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December. This had mainly reflected base effects, as the negative flow in January 2024 had dropped out of the annual calculation. Corporate debt issuance had increased in January in terms of the monthly flow, but the annual growth rate had remained broadly stable at 3.4%. Mortgage lending had continued its gradual rise, with an annual growth rate of 1.3% in January after 1.1% in December. In summary, the disinflation process remained well on track. Inflation had continued to develop broadly as staff expected, and the latest projections closely aligned with the previous inflation outlook. Most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth was moderating as expected. The recent interest rate cuts were making new borrowing less expensive and loan growth was picking up. At the same time, past interest rate hikes were still transmitting to the stock of credit and lending remained subdued overall. The economy faced continued headwinds, reflecting lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment, in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty. Rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of past rate hikes continued to be the key drivers underpinning the expected pick-up in demand over time. Based on this assessment, Mr Lane proposed lowering the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the proposal to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was rooted in the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Moving the deposit facility rate from 2.75% to 2.50% would be a robust decision. In particular, holding at 2.75% could weaken the required recovery in consumption and investment and thereby risk undershooting the inflation target in the medium term. Furthermore, the new projections indicated that, if the baseline dynamics for inflation and economic growth continued to hold, further easing would be required to stabilise inflation at the medium-term target on a sustainable basis. Under this baseline, from a macroeconomic perspective, a variety of rate paths over the coming meetings could deliver the remaining degree of easing. This reinforced the value of a meeting-by-meeting approach, with no pre-commitment to any particular rate path. In the near term, it would allow the Governing Council to take into account all the incoming data between the current meeting and the meeting on 16-17 April, together with the latest waves of the ECB’s surveys, including the bank lending survey, the Corporate Telephone Survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Consumer Expectations Survey. Moreover, the Governing Council should pay special attention to the unfolding geopolitical risks and emerging fiscal developments in view of their implications for activity and inflation. In particular, compared with the rate paths consistent with the baseline projection, the appropriate rate path at future meetings would also reflect the evolution and/or materialisation of the upside and downside risks to inflation and economic momentum. As the Governing Council had advanced further in the process of lowering rates from their peak, the communication about the state of transmission in the monetary policy statement should evolve. Mr Lane proposed replacing the “level” assessment that “monetary policy remains restrictive” with the more “directional” statement that “our monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive”. In a similar vein, the Governing Council should replace the reference “financing conditions continue to be tight” with an acknowledgement that “a headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit, and lending remains subdued overall”. As regards the external environment, members took note of the assessment provided by Mr Lane. Global activity at the end of 2024 had been marginally stronger than expected (possibly supported by firms frontloading imports of foreign inputs ahead of potential trade disruptions) and according to the March 2025 ECB staff projections global growth was expected to remain fairly solid overall, while moderating slightly over 2025-27. This moderation came mainly from expected lower growth rates for the United States and China, which were partially compensated for by upward revisions to the outlook for other economies. Euro area foreign demand was seen to evolve broadly in line with global activity over the rest of the projection horizon. Compared with the December 2024 Eurosystem staff projections, foreign demand was projected to be slightly weaker over 2025-27. This weakness was seen to stem mainly from lower US imports. Recent data in the United States had come in on the soft side. It was highlighted that the March 2025 projections only incorporated tariffs implemented at the time of the cut-off date (namely US tariffs of 10% on imports from China and corresponding retaliatory tariffs on US exports to China). By contrast, US tariffs that had been suspended or not yet formally announced at the time of the cut-off date were treated as risks to the baseline projections. Elevated and exceptional uncertainty was highlighted as a key theme for both the external environment and the euro area economy. Current uncertainties were seen as multidimensional (political, geopolitical, tariff-related and fiscal) and as comprising “radical” or “Knightian” elements, in other words a type of uncertainty that could not be quantified or captured well by standard tools and quantitative analysis. In particular, the unpredictable patterns of trade protectionism in the United States were currently having an impact on the outlook for the global economy and might also represent a more lasting regime change. It was also highlighted that, aside from specific, already enacted tariff measures, uncertainty surrounding possible additional measures was creating significant extra headwinds in the global economy. The impact of US tariffs on trading partners was seen to be clearly negative for activity while being more ambiguous for inflation. For the latter, an upside effect in the short term, partly driven by the exchange rate, might be broadly counterbalanced by downside pressures on prices from lower demand, especially over the medium term. It was underlined that it was challenging to determine, ex ante, the impact of protectionist measures, as this would depend crucially on how the measures were deployed and was likely to be state and scale-dependent, in particular varying with the duration of the protectionist measures and the extent of any retaliatory measures. More generally, a tariff could be seen as a tax on production and consumption, which also involved a wealth transfer from the private to the public sector. In this context, it was underlined that tariffs were generating welfare losses for all parties concerned. With regard to economic activity in the euro area, members broadly agreed with the assessment presented by Mr Lane. The overall narrative remained that the economy continued to grow, but in a modest way. Based on Eurostat’s flash release for the euro area (of 14 February) and available country data, year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 appeared broadly in line with what had been expected. However, the composition was somewhat different, with more private and government consumption, less investment and deeply negative net exports. It was mentioned that recent surveys had been encouraging, pointing to a turnaround in the interest rate-sensitive manufacturing sector, with the euro area manufacturing PMI reaching its highest level in 24 months. While developments in services continued to be better than those in manufacturing, survey evidence suggested that momentum in the services sector could be slowing, although manufacturing might become less negative – a pattern of rotation also seen in surveys of the global economy. Elevated uncertainty was undoubtedly a factor holding back firms’ investment spending. Exports were also weak, particularly for capital goods.The labour market remained resilient, however. The unemployment rate in January (6.2%) was at a historical low for the euro area economy, once again better than expected, although the positive momentum in terms of the rate of employment growth appeared to be moderating. While the euro area economy was still expected to grow in the first quarter of the year, it was noted that incoming data were mixed. Current and forward-looking indicators were becoming less negative for the manufacturing sector but less positive for the services sector. Consumer confidence had ticked up in the first two months of 2025, albeit from low levels, while households’ unemployment expectations had also improved slightly. Regarding investment, there had been some improvement in housing investment indicators, with the housing output PMI having improved measurably, thus indicating a bottoming-out in the housing market, and although business investment indicators remained negative, they were somewhat less so. Looking ahead, economic growth should continue and strengthen over time, although once again more slowly than previously expected. Real wage developments and more affordable credit should support household spending. The outlook for investment and exports remained the most uncertain because it was clouded by trade policy and geopolitical uncertainties. Broad agreement was expressed with the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Economic growth was expected to continue, albeit at a modest pace and somewhat slower than previously expected. It was noted, however, that the downward revision to economic growth in 2025 was driven in part by carry-over effects from a weak fourth quarter in 2024 (according to Eurostat’s flash release). Some concern was raised that the latest downward revisions to the current projections had come after a sequence of downward revisions. Moreover, other institutions’ forecasts appeared to be notably more pessimistic. While these successive downward revisions to the staff projections had been modest on an individual basis, cumulatively they were considered substantial. At the same time, it was highlighted that negative judgement had been applied to the March projections, notably on investment and net exports among the demand components. By contrast, there had been no significant change in the expected outlook for private consumption, which, supported by real wage growth, accumulated savings and lower interest rates, was expected to remain the main element underpinning growth in economic activity. While there were some downward revisions to expectations for government consumption, investment and exports, the outlook for each of these components was considered to be subject to heightened uncertainty. Regarding government consumption, recent discussions in the fiscal domain could mean that the slowdown in growth rates of government spending in 2025 assumed in the projections might not materialise after all. These new developments could pose risks to the projections, as they would have an impact on economic growth, inflation and possibly also potential growth, countering the structural weakness observed so far. At the same time, it was noted that a significant rise in the ten-year yields was already being observed, whereas the extra stimulus from military spending would likely materialise only further down the line. Overall, members considered that the broad narrative of a modestly growing euro area economy remained valid. Developments in US trade policies and elevated uncertainty were weighing on businesses and consumers in the euro area, and hence on the outlook for activity. Private consumption had underpinned euro area growth at the end of 2024. The ongoing increase in real wages, as well as low unemployment, the stabilisation in consumer confidence and saving rates that were still above pre-pandemic levels, provided confidence that a consumption-led recovery was still on track. But some concern was expressed over the extent to which private consumption could further contribute to a pick-up in growth. In this respect, it was argued that moderating real wage growth, which was expected to be lower in 2025 than in 2024, and weak consumer confidence were not promising for a further increase in private consumption. Concerning the behaviour of household savings, it was noted that saving rates were clearly higher than during the pre-pandemic period, although they were projected to decline gradually over the forecast horizon. However, the current heightened uncertainty and the increase in fiscal deficits could imply that higher household savings might persist, partly reflecting “Ricardian” effects (i.e. consumers prone to increase savings in anticipation of higher future taxes needed to service the extra debt). At the same time, it was noted that the modest decline in the saving rate was only one factor supporting the outlook for private consumption. Regarding investment, a distinction was made between housing and business investment. For housing, a slow recovery was forecast during the course of 2025 and beyond. This was based on the premise of lower interest rates and less negative confidence indicators, although some lag in housing investment might be expected owing to planning and permits. The business investment outlook was considered more uncertain. While industrial confidence was low, there had been some improvement in the past couple of months. However, it was noted that confidence among firms producing investment goods was falling and capacity utilisation in the sector was low and declining. It was argued that it was not the level of interest rates that was currently holding back business investment, but a high level of uncertainty about economic policies. In this context, concern was expressed that ongoing uncertainty could result in businesses further delaying investment, which, if cumulated over time, would weigh on the medium-term growth potential. The outlook for exports and the direct and indirect impact of tariff measures were a major concern. It was noted that, as a large exporter, particularly of capital goods, the euro area might feel the biggest impact of such measures. Reference was made to scenario calculations that suggested that there would be a significant negative impact on economic growth, particularly in 2025, if the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and the euro area currently being threatened were actually implemented. Regarding the specific impact on euro area exports, it was noted that, to understand the potential impact on both activity and prices, a granular level of analysis would be required, as sectors differed in terms of competition and pricing power. Which specific goods were targeted would also matter. Furthermore, while imports from the United States (as a percentage of euro area GDP) had increased over the past decade, those from the rest of the world (China, the rest of Asia and other EU countries) were larger and had increased by more. Members overall assessed that the labour market continued to be resilient and was developing broadly in line with previous expectations. The euro area unemployment rate remained at historically low levels and well below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. The strength of the labour market was seen as attenuating the social cost of the relatively weak economy as well as supporting upside pressures on wages and prices. While there had been some slowdown in employment growth, this also had to be seen in the context of slowing labour force growth. Furthermore, the latest survey indicators suggested a broad stabilisation rather than any acceleration in the slowdown. Overall, the euro area labour market remained tight, with a negative unemployment gap. Against this background, members reiterated that fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It was noted that recent discussions at the national and EU levels raised the prospect of a major change in the fiscal stance, notably in the euro area’s largest economy but also across the European Union. In the baseline projections, which had been finalised before the recent discussions, a fiscal tightening over 2025-27 had been expected owing to a reversal of previous subsidies and termination of the Next Generation EU programme in 2027. Current proposals under discussion at the national and EU levels would represent a substantial change, particularly if additional measures beyond extra defence spending were required to achieve the necessary political buy-in. It was noted, however, that not all countries had sufficient fiscal space. Hence it was underlined that governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance framework and should prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. It was also reiterated that the European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provided a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals should be swiftly adopted. In light of exceptional uncertainty around trade policies and the fiscal outlook, it was noted that one potential impact of elevated uncertainty was that the baseline scenario was becoming less likely to materialise and risk factors might suddenly enter the baseline. Moreover, elevated uncertainty could become a persistent fact of life. It was also considered that the current uncertainty was of a different nature to that normally considered in the projection exercises and regular policymaking. In particular, uncertainty was not so much about how certain variables behaved within the model (or specific model parameters) but whether fundamental building blocks of the models themselves might have to be reconsidered (also given that new phenomena might fall entirely outside the realm of historical data or precedent). This was seen as a call for new approaches to capture uncertainty. Against this background, members assessed that even though some previous downside risks had already materialised, the risks to economic growth had increased and remained tilted to the downside. An escalation in trade tensions would lower euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Ongoing uncertainty about global trade policies could drag investment down. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remained a major source of uncertainty. Growth could be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening lasted longer than expected. At the same time, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allowed domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster. An increase in defence and infrastructure spending could also add to growth. For the near-term outlook, the ECB’s mechanical updates of growth expectations in the first half of 2025 suggested some downside risk. Beyond the near term, it was noted that the baseline projections only included tariffs (and retaliatory measures) already implemented but not those announced or threatened but not yet implemented. The materialisation of additional tariff measures would weigh on euro area exports and investment as well as add to the competitiveness challenges facing euro area businesses. At the same time, the potential fiscal impulse had not been included either. With regard to price developments, members largely agreed that the disinflation process was on track, with inflation continuing to develop broadly as staff had expected. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined in January but remained high, as wages and some services prices were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a delay. However, recent wage negotiations pointed to an ongoing moderation in labour cost pressures, with a lower contribution from profits partially buffering their impact on inflation and most indicators of underlying inflation pointing to a sustained return of inflation to target. Preliminary indicators for labour cost growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 suggested a further moderation, which gave some greater confidence that moderating wage growth would support the projected disinflation process. It was stressed that the annual growth of compensation per employee, which, based on available euro area data, had stood at 4.4% in the third quarter of 2024, should be seen as the most important and most comprehensive measure of wage developments. According to the projections, it was expected to decline substantially by the end of 2025, while available hard data on wage growth were still generally coming in above 4%, and indications from the ECB wage tracker were based only on a limited number of wage agreements for the latter part of 2025. The outlook for wages was seen as a key element for the disinflation path foreseen in the projections, and the sustainable return of inflation to target was still subject to considerable uncertainty. In this context, some concern was expressed that relatively tight labour markets might slow the rate of moderation and that weak labour productivity growth might push up the rate of increase in unit labour costs. With respect to the incoming data, members reiterated that hard data for the first quarter would be crucial for ascertaining further progress with disinflation, as foreseen in the staff projections. The differing developments among the main components of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) were noted. Energy prices had increased but were volatile, and some of the increases had already been reversed most recently. Notwithstanding the increases in the annual rate of change in food prices, momentum in this salient component was down. Developments in the non-energy industrial goods component remained modest. Developments in services were the main focus of discussions. While some concerns were expressed that momentum in services appeared to have remained relatively elevated or had even edged up (when looking at three-month annualised growth rates), it was also argued that the overall tendency was clearly down. It was stressed that detailed hard data on services inflation over the coming months would be key and would reveal to what extent the projected substantial disinflation in services in the first half of 2025 was on track. Regarding the March inflation projections, members commended the improved forecasting performance in recent projection rounds. It was underlined that the 0.2 percentage point upward revision to headline inflation for 2025 primarily reflected stronger energy price dynamics compared with the December projections. Some concern was expressed that inflation was now only projected to reach 2% on a sustained basis in early 2026, rather than in the course of 2025 as expected previously. It was also noted that, although the baseline scenario had been broadly materialising, uncertainties had been increasing substantially in several respects. Furthermore, recent data releases had seen upside surprises in headline inflation. However, it was remarked that the latest upside revision to the headline inflation projections had been driven mainly by the volatile prices of crude oil and natural gas, with the decline in those prices since the cut-off date for the projections being large enough to undo much of the upward revision. In addition, it was underlined that the projections for HICP inflation excluding food and energy were largely unchanged, with staff projecting an average of 2.2% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026. The argument was made that the recent revisions showed once again that it was misleading to mechanically relate lower growth to lower inflation, given the prevalence of supply-side shocks. With respect to inflation expectations, reference was made to the latest market-based inflation fixings, which were typically highly sensitive to the most recent energy commodity price developments. Beyond the short term, inflation fixings were lower than the staff projections. Attention was drawn to a sharp increase in the five-year forward inflation expectations five years ahead following the latest expansionary fiscal policy announcements. However, it was argued that this measure remained consistent with genuine expectations broadly anchored around 2% if estimated risk premia were taken into account, and there had been a less substantial adjustment in nearer-term inflation compensation. Looking at other sources of evidence on expectations, collected before the fiscal announcements (as was the case for all survey evidence), panellists in the Survey of Monetary Analysts saw inflation close to 2%. Consumer inflation expectations from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey were generally at higher levels, but they showed a small downtick for one-year ahead expectations. It was also highlighted that firms mentioned inflation in their earnings calls much less frequently, suggesting inflation was becoming less salient. Against this background, members saw a number of uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Increasing friction in global trade was adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. A general escalation in trade tensions could see the euro depreciate and import costs rise, which would put upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, lower demand for euro area exports as a result of higher tariffs and a re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity would put downward pressure on inflation. Geopolitical tensions created two-sided inflation risks as regards energy markets, consumer confidence and business investment. Extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increased by more than expected. A boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand. But inflation might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampened demand by more than expected. The view was expressed that the prospect of significantly higher fiscal spending, together with a potentially significant increase in inflation in the event of a tariff scenario with retaliation, deserved particular consideration in future risk assessments. Moreover, the risks might be exacerbated by potential second-round effects and upside wage pressures in an environment where inflation had not yet returned to target and the labour market remained tight. In particular, it was argued that the boost to domestic demand from fiscal spending would make it easier for firms to pass through higher costs to consumers rather than absorb them in their profits, at a time when inflation expectations were more fragile and firms had learned to rapidly adapt the frequency of repricing in an environment of high uncertainty. It was argued that growth concerns were mainly structural in nature and that monetary policy was ineffective in resolving structural weaknesses. Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, market interest rates in the euro area had decreased after the Governing Council’s January meeting, before surging in the days immediately preceding the March meeting. Long-term bond yields had risen significantly: for example, the yield on ten-year German government bonds had increased by about 30 basis points in a day – the highest one-day jump since the surge linked to German reunification in March 1990. These moves probably reflected a mix of expectations of higher average policy rates in the future and a rise in the term premium, and represented a tightening of financing conditions. The revised outlook for fiscal policy – associated in particular with the need to increase defence spending – and the resulting increase in aggregate demand were the main drivers of these developments and had also led to an appreciation of the euro. Looking back over a longer period, it was noted that broader financial conditions had already been easing substantially since late 2023 because of factors including monetary policy easing, the stock market rally and the recent depreciation of the euro until the past few days. In this respect, it was mentioned that, abstracting from the very latest developments, after the strong increase in long-term rates in 2022, yields had been more or less flat, albeit with some volatility. However, it was contended that the favourable impact on debt financing conditions of the decline in short-term rates had been partly offset by the recent significant increase in long-term rates. Moreover, debt financing conditions remained relatively tight compared with longer-term historical averages over the past ten to 15 years, which covered the low-interest period following the financial crisis. Wider financial markets appeared to have become more optimistic about Europe and less optimistic about the United States since the January meeting, although some doubt was raised as to whether that divergence was set to last. The ECB’s interest rate cuts were gradually contributing to an easing of financing conditions by making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. The average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to 4.2% in January, from 4.4% in December. Over the same period the average interest rate on new mortgages had fallen to 3.3%, from 3.4%. At the same time, lending rates were proving slower to turn around in real terms, so there continued to be a headwind to the easing of financing conditions from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to the stock of credit. This meant that lending rates on the outstanding stock of loans had only declined marginally, especially for mortgages. The recent substantial increase in long-term yields could also have implications for lending conditions by affecting bank funding conditions and influencing the cost of loans linked to long-term yields. However, it was noted that it was no surprise that financing conditions for households and firms still appeared tight when compared with the period of negative interest rates, because longer-term fixed rate loans taken out during the low-interest rate period were being refinanced at higher interest rates. Financing conditions were in any case unlikely to return to where they had been prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the inflation surge. Furthermore, the most recent bank lending survey pointed to neutral or even stimulative effects of the general level of interest rates on bank lending to firms and households. Overall, it was observed that financing conditions were at present broadly as expected in a cycle in which interest rates would have been cut by 150 basis points according to the proposal, having previously been increased by 450 basis points. As for lending volumes, loan growth was picking up, but lending remained subdued overall. Growth in bank lending to firms had risen to 2.0% in January, up from 1.7% in December, on the back of a moderate monthly flow of new loans. Growth in debt securities issued by firms had risen to 3.4% in annual terms. Mortgage lending had continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall, with an annual growth rate of 1.3%, up from 1.1% in December. Underlying momentum in bank lending remained strong, with the three-month and six-month annualised growth rates standing above the annual growth rate. At the same time, it was contended that the recent uptick in bank lending to firms mainly reflected a substitution from market-based financing in response to the higher cost of debt security financing, so that the overall increase in corporate borrowing had been limited. Furthermore, lending was increasing from quite low levels, and the stock of bank loans to firms relative to GDP remained lower than 25 years ago. Nonetheless, the growth of credit to firms was now roughly back to pre-pandemic levels and more than three times the average during the 2010s, while mortgage credit growth was only slightly below the average in that period. On the household side, it was noted that the demand for housing loans was very strong according to the bank lending survey, with the average increase in demand in the last two quarters of 2024 being the highest reported since the start of the survey. This seemed to be a natural consequence of lower interest rates and suggested that mortgage lending would keep rising. However, consumer credit had not really improved over the past year. Strong bank balance sheets had been contributing to the recovery in credit, although it was observed that non-performing and “stage 2” loans – those loans associated with a significant increase in credit risk – were increasing. The credit dynamics that had been picking up also suggested that the decline in excess liquidity held by banks as reserves with the Eurosystem was not adversely affecting banks’ lending behaviour. This was to be expected since banks’ liquidity coverage ratios were high, and it was underlined that banks could in any case post a wide range of collateral to obtain liquidity from the ECB at any time. Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function. These comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission. Starting with the inflation outlook, members noted that inflation had continued to develop broadly as expected, with incoming data largely in line with the previous projections. Indeed, the central scenario had broadly materialised for several successive quarters, with relatively limited changes in the inflation projections. This was again the case in the March projections, which were closely aligned with the previous inflation outlook. Inflation expectations had remained well anchored despite the very high uncertainty, with most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continuing to stand at around 2%. This suggested that inflation remained on course to stabilise at the 2% inflation target in the medium term. Still, this continued to depend on the materialisation of the projected material decline in wage growth over the course of 2025 and on a swift and significant deceleration in services inflation in the coming months. And, while services inflation had declined in February, its momentum had yet to show conclusive signs of a stable downward trend. It was widely felt that the most important recent development was the significant increase in uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation, which could unfold in either direction. There were many unknowns, notably related to tariff developments and global geopolitical developments, and to the outlook for fiscal policies linked to increased defence and other spending. The latter had been reflected in the sharp moves in long-term yields and the euro exchange rate in the days preceding the meeting, while energy prices had rebounded. This meant that, while the baseline staff projection was still a reasonable anchor, a lower probability should be attached to that central scenario than in normal times. In this context, it was argued that such uncertainty was much more fundamental and important than the small revisions that had been embedded in the staff inflation projections. The slightly higher near-term profile for headline inflation in the staff projections was primarily due to volatile components such as energy prices and the exchange rate. Since the cut-off date for the projections, energy prices had partially reversed their earlier increases. With the economy now in the flat part of the disinflation process, small adjustments in the inflation path could lead to significant shifts in the precise timing of when the target would be reached. Overall, disinflation was seen to remain well on track. Inflation had continued to develop broadly as staff had expected and the latest projections closedly aligned with the previous inflation outlook. At the same time, it was widely acknowledged that risks and uncertainty had clearly increased. Turning to underlying inflation, members concurred that most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Core inflation was coming down and was projected to decline further as a result of a further easing in labour cost pressures and the continued downward pressure on prices from the past monetary policy tightening. Domestic inflation, which closely tracked services inflation, had declined in January but remained high, as wages and prices of certain services were still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. However, while the continuing strength of the labour market and the potentially large fiscal expansion could both add to future wage pressures, there were many signs that wage growth was moderating as expected, with lower profits partially buffering the impact on inflation. Regarding the transmission of monetary policy, recent credit dynamics showed that monetary policy transmission was working, with both the past tightening and recent interest rate cuts feeding through smoothly to market interest rates, financing conditions, including bank lending rates, and credit flows. Gradual and cautious rate cuts had contributed substantially to the progress made towards a sustainable return of inflation to target and ensured that inflation expectations remained anchored at 2%, while securing a soft landing of the economy. The ECB’s monetary policy had supported increased lending. Looking ahead, lags in policy transmission suggested that, overall, credit growth would probably continue to increase. The impact of financial conditions on the economy was discussed. In particular, it was argued that the level of interest rates and possible financing constraints – stemming from the availability of both internal and external funds – might be weighing on corporate investment. At the same time, it was argued that structural factors contributed to the weakness of investment, including high energy and labour costs, the regulatory environment and increased import competition, and high uncertainty, including on economic policy and the outlook for demand. These were seen as more important factors than the level of interest rates in explaining the weakness in investment. Consumption also remained weak and the household saving rate remained high, though this could also be linked to elevated uncertainty rather than to interest rates. On this basis, the view was expressed that it was no longer clear whether monetary policy continued to be restrictive. With the last rate hike having been 18 months previously, and the first cut nine months previously, it was suggested that the balance was increasingly shifting towards the transmission of rate cuts. In addition, although quantitative tightening was operating gradually and smoothly in the background, the stock of asset holdings was still compressing term premia and long-term rates, while the diminishing compression over time implied a tightening. Against this background, almost all members supported the proposal by Mr Lane to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Lowering the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was justified by the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Looking ahead, the point was made that the likely shocks on the horizon, including from escalating trade tensions, and uncertainty more generally, risked significantly weighing on growth. It was argued that these factors could increase the risk of undershooting the inflation target in the medium term. In addition, it was argued that the recent appreciation of the euro and the decline in energy prices since the cut-off date for the staff projections, together with the cooling labour market and well-anchored inflation expectations, mitigated concerns about the upward revision to the near-term inflation profile and upside risks to inflation more generally. From this perspective, it was argued that being prudent in the face of uncertainty did not necessarily equate to being gradual in adjusting the interest rate. By contrast, it was contended that high levels of uncertainty, including in relation to trade policies, fiscal policy developments and sticky services and domestic inflation, called for caution in policy-setting and especially in communication. Inflation was no longer foreseen to return to the 2% target in 2025 in the latest staff projections and the date had now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2026. Moreover, the latest revision to the projected path meant that inflation would by that time have remained above target for almost five years. This concern would be amplified should upside risks to inflation materialise and give rise to possible second-round effects. For example, a significant expansion of fiscal policy linked to defence and other spending would increase price pressures. This had the potential to derail the disinflation process and keep inflation higher for longer. Indeed, investors had immediately reacted to the announcements in the days preceding the meeting. This was reflected in an upward adjustment of the market interest rate curve, dialling back the number of expected rate cuts, and a sharp increase in five-year forward inflation expectations five years ahead. The combination of US tariffs and retaliation measures could also pose upside risks to inflation, especially in the near term. Moreover, firms had also learned to raise their prices more quickly in response to new inflationary shocks. Against this background, a few members stressed that they could only support the proposal to reduce interest rates by a further 25 basis points if there was also a change in communication that avoided any indication of future cuts or of the future direction of travel, which was seen as akin to providing forward guidance. One member abstained, as the proposed communication did not drop any reference to the current monetary policy stance being restrictive. In this context, members discussed in more detail the extent to which monetary policy could still be described as restrictive following the proposed interest rate cut. While it was clear that, with each successive rate cut, monetary policy was becoming less restrictive and closer to most estimates of the natural or neutral rate of interest, different views were expressed in this regard. On the one hand, it was argued that it was no longer possible to be confident that monetary policy was restrictive. It was noted that, following the proposed further cut of 25 basis points, the level of the deposit facility rate would be roughly equal to the current level of inflation. Even after the increase in recent days, long-term yields remained very modest in real terms. Credit and equity risk premia continued to be fairly contained and the euro was not overvalued despite the recent appreciation. There were also many indications in lending markets that the degree of policy restriction had declined appreciably. Credit was responding to monetary policy broadly as expected, with the tightening effect of past rate hikes now gradually giving way to the easing effects of the subsequent rate cuts, which had been transmitting smoothly to market and bank lending rates. This shifting balance was likely to imply a continued move towards easier credit conditions and a further recovery in credit flows. In addition, subdued growth could not be taken as evidence that policy was restrictive, given that the current weakness was seen by firms as largely structural. In this vein, it was also noted that a deposit facility rate of 2.50% was within, or at least at around the upper bound of, the range of Eurosystem staff estimates for the natural or neutral interest rate, with reference to the recently published Economic Bulletin box, entitled “Natural rate estimates for the euro area: insights, uncertainties and shortcomings”. Using the full array of models and ignoring estimation uncertainty, this currently ranged from 1.75% to 2.75%. Notwithstanding important caveats and the uncertainties surrounding the estimates, it was contended that they still provided a guidepost for the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness. Moreover, while recognising the high model uncertainty, it was argued that both model-based and market-based measures suggested that one main driver of the notable increase in the neutral interest rate over the past three years had been the increased net supply of government bonds. In this context, it was suggested that the impending expansionary fiscal policy linked to defence and other spending – and the likely associated increase in the excess supply of bonds – would affect real interest rates and probably lead to a persistent and significant increase in the neutral interest rate. This implied that, for a given policy rate, monetary policy would be less restrictive. On the other hand, it was argued that monetary policy would still be in restrictive territory even after the proposed interest rate cut. Inflation was on a clear trajectory to return to the 2% medium-term target while the euro area growth outlook was very weak. Consumption and investment remained weak despite high employment and past wage increases, consumer confidence continued to be low and the household saving ratio remained at high levels. This suggested an economy in stagnation – a sign that monetary policy was still in restrictive territory. Expansionary fiscal policy also had the potential to increase asset swap spreads between sovereign bond and OIS markets. With a greater sovereign bond supply, that intermediation spread would probably widen, which would contribute to tighter financing conditions. In addition, it was underlined that the latest staff projections were conditional on a market curve that implied about three further rate cuts, indicating that a 2.50% deposit facility rate was above the level necessary to sustainably achieve the 2% target in the medium term. It was stressed, in this context, that the staff projections did not hinge on assumptions about the neutral interest rate. More generally, it was argued that, while the natural or neutral rate could be a useful concept when policy rates were very far away from it and there was a need to communicate the direction of travel, it was of little value for steering policy on a meeting-by-meeting basis. This was partly because its level was fundamentally unobservable, and so it was subject to significant model and parameter uncertainty, a wide range between minimum and maximum estimates, and changing estimates over time. The range of estimates around the midpoint and the uncertainty bands around each estimate underscored why it was important to avoid excessive focus on any particular value. Rather, it was better to simply consider what policy setting was appropriate at any given point in time to meet the medium-term inflation target in light of all factors and shocks affecting the economy, including structural elements. To the extent that consideration should be given to the natural or neutral interest rate, it was noted that the narrower range of the most reliable staff estimates, between 1.75% and 2.25%, indicated that monetary policy was still restrictive at a deposit facility rate of 2.50%. Overall, while there had been a measurable increase in the natural interest rate since the pandemic, it was argued that it was unlikely to have reached levels around 2.5%. Against this background, the proposal by Mr Lane to change the wording of the monetary policy statement by replacing “monetary policy remains restrictive” with “monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive” was widely seen as a reasonable compromise. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that, after a sustained sequence of rate reductions, the policy rate was undoubtedly less restrictive than at earlier stages in the current easing phase, but it had entered a range in which it was harder to determine the precise level of restrictiveness. In this regard, “meaningfully” was seen as an important qualifier, as monetary policy had already become less restrictive with the first rate cut in June 2024. On the other hand, while interest rates had already been cut substantially, the formulation did not rule out further cuts, even if the scale and timing of such cuts were difficult to determine ex ante. On the whole, it was considered important that the amended language should not be interpreted as sending a signal in either direction for the April meeting, with both a cut and a pause on the table, depending on incoming data. The proposed change in the communication was also seen as a natural progression from the previous change, implemented in December. This had removed the intention to remain “sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary” and shifted to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance, on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on incoming data. From this perspective there was no need to identify the neutral interest rate, particularly given that future policy might need to be above, at or below neutral, depending on the inflation and growth outlook. Looking ahead, members reiterated that the Governing Council remained determined to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. Its interest rate decisions would continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Uncertainty was particularly high and rising owing to increasing friction in global trade, geopolitical developments and the design of fiscal policies to support increased defence and other spending. This underscored the importance of following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting. * Members not holding a voting right in March 2025 under Article 10.2 of the ESCB Statute. ** In accordance with Article 284 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Title: The U.S. Economy Is Being Led Over a Cliff by an Idiot and His Lemmings

By Dustin Rowles | News | April 3, 2025 | I hope everyone enjoyed their brief respite from the horrors of the current administration after a rare good day — well, half a day — because by 4 p.m. yesterday, the President delivered a rambling, nonsensical, and infuriating speech announcing a boatload of new tariffs that many are calling “worse than the worst-case scenario.” Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff across the board, excluding Mexico and Canada, which already face their own 25 percent tariffs. Countries he labeled “bad actors” are getting hit with cumulative tariffs as high as 60 percent. The EU is facing a 20 percent tariff. The UK — with whom we have a trade surplus — is still being slapped with a 10 percent tariff. The formula Trump used, which the internet reverse-engineered as completely batshit, is erratic at best. If the tariffs hold (and with Trump, who knows?), the country is effectively looking at a $600 billion annual tax. Grocery prices are going to rise. Electronics, sneakers, and clothing will get more expensive. Inflation will surge, and the stock market will sink. Early indicators suggest as much as a 5 percent drop in the NASDAQ when the bell rings this morning — unsurprising, given that the tech industry sources many of its parts from countries hit hardest by tariffs (China, Vietnam, India, Taiwan). The price of a new Subaru Crosstrek, I read, will rise by around $10,000. The new Nintendo Switch could jump by as much as $120, with new games rising by $30. Consumers will delay buying cars, computers, and washing machines, which will hurt retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart — leading to layoffs and a higher unemployment rate. We’ve seen this cycle before: companies slash advertising and marketing budgets, hurting giants like Google and Facebook and, by extension, the rest of the media. And the thing is, it’s all so f**king pointless. Ostensibly, the goal is to increase U.S. manufacturing, but we’re a service-based economy — and those services will be hit with retaliatory tariffs, triggering even more economic pain. The idea that companies like Nike or Apple will move their manufacturing to the U.S. ignores the reality: higher wages mean higher prices, which leads to more inflation. And even if companies wanted to come back, the U.S. isn’t equipped to restart large-scale manufacturing. It would take years — only to see the next administration (or Trump himself) reverse course again. The President of the United States doesn’t understand how the economy works, and the Republican Congress is too chickenshit to take back the tariff powers they do legally possess. Yesterday, the Senate — with help from a few Republican Senators (McConnell, Rand, Collins, and Murkowski) — passed legislation reversing the Canadian tariffs, but it’s expected to die in the House, despite the warning sign from the Florida special election about how vulnerable swing-state Republicans may be. Trump needs to be neutered. Congress has the power to do it. Instead, they’re pushing ahead with a plan to renew and expand the Trump tax cuts — to appease the billionaires currently taking a bath in the stock market. But even they may not see much of a net gain. For the rest of us: we get nothing but a faltering economy and shrinking 401Ks as the market continues its tumble. It’s bad. It’s real bad. There are no winners here. And the best we can hope for is that Trump panics at the market plunge and negotiates carve-outs or exceptions. But it may be too late. Hell, the rest of the world hates us now, too — because we’re tanking their economies right along with ours. We’re being led over a cliff by an idiot and his lemmings. But hey! At least the White House may push out Elon Musk in the coming weeks.

Title: Trump unveils new tariffs and CDC's IVF team is eliminated: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Global markets fall following Trump’s tariff announcements. The CDC team that tracked IVF across the country was eliminated. And a college student who was the subject of a viral rumor amplified by prominent figures said it “ruined” her life. Here’s what to know today. President Donald Trump announced expansive tariffs on the United States’ largest trading partners impacting billions, if not trillions, of dollars in trade. China would be hit with a 54% tariff, the European Union with 20%, India with 26% and Japan with 24%, among many others. The White House arrived at the percentages based on how it is calculating duties on U.S. exports, as well as “nonmonetary” trade barriers based on things like countries’ manipulating their currencies or serving as “pollution havens,” but it was not immediately clear how the exact numbers were calculated. China said it would “resolutely take countermeasures” against the U.S., with the Chinese Commerce Ministry calling Trump’s latest move “a typical act of unilateral bullying.” The European Union threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves. The Trump administration has signaled it is uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than pressing for talks. In other words, this trade war is just getting started, NBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans and business and data correspondent Brian Cheung wrote in an analysis. “This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy, but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note yesterday evening. “Many countries will likely end up in a recession.” Speaking from the White House Rose Garden yesterday afternoon, Trump slammed what he said were “much higher” import taxes on goods coming from the U.S. compared to what the U.S. had charged other countries for their exports. He argued that the U.S. has been getting “ripped off” by other nations while working-class wages languished. With these new tariffs, American industry “will be reborn,” the president said, touting a new “golden age of America.” But the tariffs won’t provide an immediate jolt to the economy. Instead, they’re expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains and now could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins. The White House has warned of some pain ahead for consumers and businesses but said it is a trade-off that will be worthwhile eventually.

Public health experts and IVF advocates said they are shocked at the elimination of the CDC's Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team — a group of six epidemiologists, data analysts and researchers that tracked how well in vitro fertilization worked across the U.S. Their layoffs were part of the sweeping cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and come just a week after President Donald Trump declared himself "the fertilization president" while touting efforts to expand IVF. The team worked under the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted this week, and was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF. It also maintained an “IVF success estimator,” a tool that allowed people to estimate how well IVF would work for them and contained data about clinics’ success rates across the country. “This is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,” said Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of a nonprofit group for reproductive health. An HHS official said the “work will continue” but did not provide details. Read the full story here. A 19-year-old University of Mississippi student who was the subject of an internet rumor amplified by notable figures including popular ESPN host and analyst Pat McAfee is speaking out, saying the barrage of harassment she received has “ruined” her life. It’s “the worst feeling in the world,” Mary Kate Cornett said in an interview with NBC News’ Tom Llamas. “It makes you feel so alone. It’s a horrible experience.” Cornett said her friends first told her about a rumor that was spreading on an anonymous messaging app called YikYak, about a student in her sorority who was sleeping with her boyfriend’s father. Eventually, she saw that her name was a trending topic on X. The rumor referenced on “The Pat McAfee Show” alleged a “ménage à trois” at Ole Miss, but Cornett and her boyfriend were not mentioned by name in the show. After Cornett’s number was shared online, she said she was overwhelmed with “thousands” of calls and texts, with some telling her she “deserved to die.” Cornett said she intends to take legal action against McAfee and ESPN, and potentially others who, she said, helped spread the rumor. “I’m not a public figure that you can go talk about on your show to get more views,” she said.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq futures lead stock plunge, Dow drops 1,000 points as Trump's punishing tariffs rip through markets

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/03/2025 3:57:27 AM PDT by hardspunned US stock futures plunged on Thursday as investors digested President Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on all US trading partners, which has sent shockwaves through markets and the global trade order. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dived 3.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) tumbled 2.5%, or over 1,000 points.

Title: The Biggest Billionaire Gainers 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roycanivel/2025/04/03/the-biggest-billionaire-gainers-2025/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T10:30:00Z

ByRoy Canivel ByRoy Canivel, Forbes Staff. The past 12 months have been very good to the planet’s billionaires. There are more of them (3,028) than ever before and they’re richer than they’ve ever been (worth a combined $16.1 trillion). Overall, the billionaire class is nearly $2 trillion richer than last year. But the big gains have not been shared evenly: $453 billion of the increase comes just from ten super fortunate people. These ten biggest gainers on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list each added tens of billions—or, in one case, more than $100 billion—to their already-massive fortunes since the 2024 ranking. They made their money in retail, finance and, mainly, tech. No one in the world gained more than Elon Musk, who took back the title of richest person in the world after a stellar year for his startups SpaceX and xAI, plus a 12-month rise in the share price of Tesla, despite a recent selloff. Musk is an astonishing $147 billion richer this year. He’s the only billionaire to add nine figures to his net worth since the 2024 list. Eight of the ten are American citizens, either through birth or, in the case of Musk, naturalization. The other two are Lei Jun, a Chinese citizen whose fortune grew by 300%, to an estimated $43.5 billion, thanks to higher demand for his company’s electric cars, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen worth an estimated $62.9 billion amid a jump in crypto markets. Tim Pannell for Forbes The only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), she became the world’s richest woman in September, her first time since 2022. She hit the $100 billion mark in November as Walmart shares climbed to record highs. The stock is up more than 53% since last year. Best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including her most recent gift, disclosed in an August filing, of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In November 2023, Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a sweeping settlement with U.S. authorities. He pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and was sentenced to four months in prison. He also paid a $50 million fine. He’s richer this year amid bull crypto markets and a Forbes investigation into his vast holdings of Binance’s exchange-issued token, BNB. Despite demands from the Justice Department to break up Google, the Alphabet cofounder and board member is $30 billion richer thanks to a 30% rise in the Google parent company’s shares. Page, who stepped down as Alphabet CEO in 2019, is reportedly working on a new company that plans to apply AI to manufacturing. The youngest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from Walmart’s board in 2016 and yielded the seat to his son Steuart. He remains the chairman of the family's Arvest Bank Group, which boasts assets of $26 billion. The cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, one of Wall Street's largest and most successful trading firms, has invested in hundreds of private companies globally, including TikTok parent ByteDance, its most valuable holding based on Forbes reporting. He’s benefitted as ByteDance’s valuation has hit $312 billion in private markets amid a bidding war over TikTok. In September, he became the first member of America’s richest family to join the $100 billion club, on the back of rising Walmart shares. The eldest son of Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from the board in June 2024, after more than four decades as a director. Visual China Group via Getty Images From budget-friendly smartphones to electric vehicles, Xiaomi has come a long way since Lei Jun cofounded the Hong Kong-listed company in 2010. With the firm’s electric vehicle venture seeing higher demand for its cars, shares have climbed more than 300%. Last year, Lei was worth an estimated $10.9 billion. He is also the chairman of Hong Kong-listed software firm Kingsoft and an investor in JOYY Inc., a Nasdaq-listed live-streaming and social media platform formerly known as YY.com. Not long ago, Mark Zuckerberg banned President Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 riots. One presidential election later, the Meta founder has friended Trump, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of his social media giant have surged nearly 25% since last year’s list, making Zuck the second richest person in the world for the first time. Ellison, too, has been sticking close to Trump. He may not have been front and center among tech tycoons during the president’s inauguration, but he stood a few feet away from Trump when the president soon announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed, in part, by Ellison’s software firm Oracle. Ellison’s net worth went up by $51 billion this year thanks to a growing AI business that helped push Oracle’s stock price up by 40%. AFP via Getty Images Thanks to an incredible $147 billion year, Elon Musk, yet again, is the richest person alive. All of his largest assets have gone up in value: Tesla stock is up 50% since last year’s list, rocket maker SpaceX is worth $350 billion, nearly double its valuation from last year, and Musk’s artificial intelligence business, xAI, raised $6 billion from private investors at a $50 billion valuation in November—then, last week, Musk announced that xAI was acquiring X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued X at more than what Musk paid in 2022, and boosted xAI’s valuation to an apparent $80 billion–a $30 billion bump from just three months ago.

Title: Global Stocks Plunge on Larger-Than-Expected US Tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-03T10:18:33Z
Full Content:
Global stocks are slumping Thursday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners that were worse that investors expected and raised fears of a growing trade war. U.S. stocks are plunging, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,200 points. Investors are seeking haven trades such as Treasurys, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.06%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended 2.7% lower, while Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Also tumbling Thursday are Magnificent Seven stocks, led by an 8% plunge for Apple (AAPL), which Citi estimates makes more than 90% of its products in China. The country faces 54% in cumulative import tariffs. Shares of the rest—Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—all dropped. "The tariff announcement was worse than most investors expected," BNP Paribas Asset Management Chief Market Strategist Daniel Morris wrote in a note Thursday. "The key question now will be whether there is scope for negotiation on the reciprocal tariffs." UPDATE—April 3, 2025: This article has been updated to include refreshed share prices.

U.S. futures indexes fell sharply early on Thursday, led by a deep slide in major tech stocks, while global markets also faced a major selloff after President Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs raised fears of a global trade war and recession. Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) ... More after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC. The benchmark S&P Futures were down around 3.1% to 5,534.25 points in premarket trading early on Thursday, while contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.51% to 41,424 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was the worst hit, falling 3.45% to 19,079.75 in the premarket, led by slumps in the share prices of major tech companies. Shares of Apple were down more than 7.3% to $207.50 early trading on Monday. Amazon’s stock dropped to $185.01 in premarket, down more than 5.5% from Wednesday’s closing price. Despite semiconductors being exempted from Trump’s reciprocal tariff measures, shares of chipmaker Nvidia fell 4.26% to $105.72 in early trading. Shares of other tech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft were also down, falling 2.43%, 3.5% and 2% respectively.

European markets also began the day in red, as the Ftse 100 was down 1.34% in morning trading, while the pan-Europe Euro Stoxx 50 fell 2.27%. The premarket slump in Apple’s stock comes as the company’s supply hubs appear to have taken the brunt of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. In recent years, Apple has tried to diversify its supply chain and reduce dependence on China by setting up manufacturing hubs for its iPhones and other devices in Vietnam and India. On Wednesday, Trump announced levies of 34% for all imports from China—where a majority of Apple’s iPhones are assembled. This 34% is on top of the previously announced 20% tariffs—bringing the total to 54%. Imports from Vietnam will also face a steep 46% tariff rate, products made in India will face a 26% levy. ‘No Winner In A Trade War’: China, EU And Others React To Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs (Forbes) Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates—54% For China, 20% On EU (Live Updates) (Forbes) Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’ (Forbes) Here’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced Wednesday (Forbes) One Community.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AVGO Stock Following President Trump’s announcement of extensive tariffs on over 100 countries, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock fell by over 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The announced tariffs include a significant 34% levy on imports from China, a major global manufacturing hub. While semiconductor goods are reportedly exempt from these specific tariffs, the broader macroeconomic consequences are a concern. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese products is expected to increase costs within the economy, potentially leading to slower economic growth or even a recession. This economic downturn could, in turn, reduce overall investment in areas like Artificial Intelligence, which could negatively impact Broadcom’s sales and future performance. Separately, see Will Apple Stock Fall To $150 On Tariff Troubles? Notably, AVGO stock looks attractive, given its solid financial performance lately, but it trades at lofty valuations making it a tricky pick at its current price of around $170. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Broadcom’s strong performance suggests that its stock might be an attractive investment. However, this positive outlook is tempered by the stock’s high valuation. Currently, AVGO is trading at 13 times its trailing revenues and 140 times its trailing earnings. This is notably higher than its average valuation over the past four years, which stood at 14 times sales and 71 times earnings. Consequently, despite its robust performance, the stock appears expensive based on these metrics, leading to the conclusion that AVGO is a potentially tricky stock to buy at its current price. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AMZN Stock To $120? How Tariffs Could Reshape Amazon's Future

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 25 March 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on March 25, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping tariffs on goods from over 100 countries has sparked concerns about a potential trade war. This could reignite inflation and weigh heavily on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), in particular, stands to be significantly affected as its online shopping marketplace is heavily dependent on goods sold by third-party merchants in China who supply a significant portion of the goods sold on Amazon. These tariffs could therefore drive up landed costs for a large proportion of Amazon’s inventory. Consequently, a trade war could also reignite inflation and weigh on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Also, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold AVGO Stock At $170 Amid Trump’s Tariffs? Amazon’s stock is not immune to economic downturns and it could face substantial losses. Evidence from 2022 shows that Amazon’s stock value decreased by over 50% within a few quarters. This begs the question: If a downturn similar to the one we saw in 2022 were to materialize, could Amazon’s stock, which was around $240 in February, potentially plummet to below $120? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. The concerns raised earlier about the potential impact of tariffs on Amazon are particularly relevant now due to the current economic landscape. While Amazon, like many retailers, has always sourced goods from China and domestic brands with Chinese manufacturing, the present situation presents a larger risk. The recently announced sweeping tariffs, coupled with the increasing possibility of a widespread trade war with key global partners, puts a significant strain on Amazon's global supply chain. This disruption could lead to higher prices for products across its platform, which, in turn, is likely to dampen overall consumer demand. The latest tariff announcement, including a substantial 34% levy on Chinese imports — a major global manufacturing hub — further underscores this risk. As these tariffs on Chinese products take effect, the resulting costs will inevitably be absorbed somewhere in the supply chain. This could mean reduced profit margins for Amazon, or ultimately, higher prices passed on to consumers. Furthermore, Trump's recent aggressive trade policies have reignited fears of a resurgence in inflation, which could further erode consumer spending power and negatively impact retailers like Amazon. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession — our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently revised its forecast, increasing the likelihood of a U.S. recession to 35%, up from its previous estimate of 20%, the Wall Street Journal reported. Given the elevated geopolitical uncertainty, partly fueled by potential policy shifts from the new Trump administration, several critical risks warrant attention. The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to contribute to global instability, and the landscape of international trade remains uncertain. Specifically, the implementation of tariffs can lead to increased import costs, which often translate into higher prices for consumers, reduced disposable income, and ultimately, weaker consumer spending. This presents a significant challenge for companies like Amazon, whose business model is heavily reliant on robust consumer discretionary spending. AMZN stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard — How Low Can Amazon.com Stock Go In A Market Crash? — has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Adding to these concerns, Amazon’s stock currently appears relatively expensive, trading at 3.3 times its trailing revenues. This is slightly higher than the stock’s average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.7 times over the past three years. Given this valuation and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $150, $120, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management — a Boston area wealth manager — whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

From optimizing the online booking experience to remain competitive with OTAs to valuing the guest’s time at check-in and being smart about upsells, Bashar explains why it’s all about the human connection and meeting your guests’ needs. Bashar also advocates for using technology as a tool to eliminate friction in every stage of the guest journey, so that hoteliers can focus on ultra-personalization that inspires guest loyalty. Tune in and find out if your guests are leaving your hotel without a true connection to your brand, and what you can do to become memorable. As Chief Marketing Officer at Revinate, Karen Stephens is focused on driving long-term growth by building Revinate’s brand equity, product marketing, and customer acquisition strategies. Her deep connections with hospitality industry leaders play a key role in crafting strategic partnerships. Karen is also the host of The Hotel Moment Podcast, where she interviews top players in the hospitality industry. Karen has been with Revinate for over 11 years, leading Revinate’s global GTM teams. Her most recent transition was from Chief Revenue Officer, where she led the team in their highest booking quarter to date in Q4 2023. Karen has more than 25 years of expertise in global hospitality technology and online distribution — including managing global accounts in travel and hospitality organizations such as Travelocity and lastminute.com Bashar Wali – 00:00:00: If I don’t connect with you, you’re just a place. I walk in, I walk out, I get what I need, I move on. Karen Stephens – 00:00:08: Welcome to the Hotel Moment Podcast presented by Revinate, the podcast where we discuss how hotel technology shapes every moment of the hotelier’s experience. Tune in as we explore the cutting edge technology transforming the hospitality industry and hear from experts and visionaries shaping the future of guest experiences. Whether you’re a hotelier or a tech enthusiast, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive in and discover how we can elevate the art of hospitality together. Karen Stephens – 00:00:36: Hello, and welcome to the Hotel Moment Podcast. I am your host, Karen Stephens, the Chief Marketing Officer of Revinate. And today we are thrilled to have Bashar Wali with us, the founder and CEO of Practice Hospitality and This Assembly, which is a group of hospitality service companies that includes Practice Hospitality. With over three decades of experience in the hospitality industry, Bashar has been at the forefront of creating innovative and human-centered hotel experiences. He is passionate about blending creative design, community engagement, and exceptional service to elevate the guest experience. From leading renowned properties like Providence hotels to founding his own companies, Bashar’s approach to hospitality is all about connecting people on a deeper level. So I have to say, if you haven’t had a conversation with Bashar before, you are really in for a treat. He’s got a great lens, as he even self-described, kind of born and raised in hotels and came up in the industry. And his take on where we are as a service industry in terms of how we relate to retail, the airlines, and what we can do better to improve connections with guests and build that trust is really phenomenal. So I think you’re going to laugh. I did a few times. He’s got some great commentary. So here you go, Bashar Wali. Hello, Bashar. Welcome to the podcast. Bashar Wali – 00:01:54: Karen, nice to see you. Delighted to be here with you. So Bashar, Karen Stephens – 00:01:57: You’ve been part of the hospitality industry for decades, and you’ve played a key role in creating unique and immersive hotel experiences. What drives you in the hospitality space, and what excites you most about where the industry is headed? Bashar Wali – 00:02:10: I wish I were that smart to agree with what you said about me. I tell people I’m just a hotel guy trying to do good work, and I really think of our industry as a ultra-simple industry at the end of the day. We’re not curing cancer. There’s no rocket science anywhere here. I feel passion is the singular, most underrated thing people think about when they think about our industry. I can teach you how to do all the things. I could show you how to push the buttons and move things around. I cannot teach you to be passionate about what you do. And unless you really have that fire within, this is not an industry for you. So for me, passion is what drives me, what motivates me, what keeps me going. And looking at human behavior, rather than trends, has been a pillar to everything I do. And what I mean by that is, I think people chase trends, and trends by definition have a shelf life. I say, I look at how humans behave, meaning how they interact with our spaces, how they interact with each other, what their eating trends look like, drinking trends look like, and I try to cater things and craft things to meet their expectations of how they live today. Again, just the way people eat, this idea of food allergies. You can’t exist today without thinking about those. But if you thought about those early enough, you became the go-to. You created loyalty. Because I say, Karen, I have gluten-free. Before gluten-free was a thing. I care about you. I see you. You matter to me. So it’s a nuanced approach that allows you to connect with people and make them feel cared for. That’s really the business we’re in, is making you feel cared for without chasing trends, without shocking on. Now, what I look to for inspiration, sadly, we’ve become a copy-paste industry. I no longer look at hospitality for inspiration. I forever said I’ve always looked at retail for inspiration. And the reason why I think retail specifically is because retail was at the verge of death and necessity is the mother of all invention. So they’ve had to really think about how do we actually change the narrative? How do we keep retail alive? And they’ve managed to understand that retail is not about transaction. Sure, it’s all about transaction, but that’s not how you attract people to you. It’s really about experiences. So you walk into retail stores. Now, everybody has activations and things and bells and whistles. So it’s less about buying the product and more about creating loyalty between you and the brand. So I definitely look at retail. I love their ease of use. I go on Instagram. I see a pair of shoes. I press three buttons. They’re in the mail coming my way. I go on a hotel website to book a room and on step 75, they’re making me change my keyboard from alpha to numerical to give them my zip code. Why in God’s name do you need my zip code? Why does it matter? Right? So it’s funny. We’re very archaic that way. And retail. Retail has leaps and bounds past us. So, yeah, I don’t look at hotels for inspiration anymore. I really look at other industries. Karen Stephens – 00:04:56: That’s really interesting. I love that correlation because I do think in hospitality, we always seem to be a little bit behind the curve and I think you hit it on the head. It’s like, how do you really connect with the guests? And it is about how somebody feels both about your brand and your website and also how they get on property. So can you talk a little bit about the ventures you’re involved in now? So there’s This Assembly and also Practice Hospitality. But how did those two work together to help hoteliers kind of achieve that feeling, for lack of a better word? Bashar Wali – 00:05:24: So we’re trying to organize it better. I know it’s by design been confusing. And frankly, I posted something recently on LinkedIn that I love the fact that many, many people that I know know me and I admire them and they admire me don’t know what I do. And it’s a little philosophical here because I say, look, what I do is not who I am. Who I am is who I am. What I do is secondary. So I love that fact. They sort of say hotel guy. We don’t know if he’s a trust fund kid who loves to loves to stay in hotels or he’s a doorman who works in hotels. And I love that. But to simplify, this assembly was designed to assemble a bunch of amazing people doing amazing things under one umbrella. And that’s what I’m trying to do now. So Practice Hospitality is a hotel management company. I will have the company that does sort of real estate development syndication advisory that will sit under that umbrella. We’re currently thinking about a couple of other ventures that would fit in that category. Ultimately, I want to be your, go-to guy. Hotel guy. Like everybody’s got a guy. I want to be your guy. When someone says, hey, I have this fill in the blank hospitality problem, Karen, I want you to say, I got a guy and kind of fill in the blank. Now, Jack of all trades, master of none, our specialty release sort of lifestyle, how to create places that matter and are memorable. I sort of say from my neurotic jumping around from hotel to hotel, there’s two kinds of hotels in the world. Only two. I don’t care about your Michelin keys and your stars and your diamonds. You’re either memorable. Or you’re forgettable. That’s it. Nothing else matters. I like to say we’re in that memorable hotel space. You can call it lifestyle. You can call it indie. You can go to a boutique. You can label it. However you want to label it. Those are nothing but labels. We’re in the business of when you walk into a place, making you feel a certain way that stays with you and you take it home with you. That’s all I want. And by the way, that could be two star or seven star. It really is not about stars. It’s about what you bring home. Karen Stephens – 00:07:15: Yeah, so I’ve actually heard you say along those lines, it’s that service is what you provide and hospitality is how you make people feel. So that’s kind of a summary of what you just said. Bashar Wali – 00:07:24: 100%. Karen Stephens – 00:07:25: Okay, so how do hotels balance high-tech innovation and with creating that emotional connection? So how do you foster that on property using technology as well? Bashar Wali – 00:07:35: I literally was having this conversation this morning using the airline business as an example. The airlines were masters of eliminating the bodies in the front and pushing you towards the app and the kiosk. They were masters at it. But the one thing they have that we don’t have is once I do all my things on my phone, I book my reservations, I check in, I change my seat, I do all the things. They remove the friction. I no longer need to call or go in a line for an hour to check in at the airport. But what the airlines have that we don’t have is now I’m stuck on that tin can in the air for one, two, 10 hours, and they can engage with me one-on-one. They can provide me service. They can get me to join their tribe by recruiting me, by providing me good service. Not many of them anymore, sadly, particularly in the US, but certainly internationally, they understand that concept. The problem with hotels following that model is, and I’ve used it before, I could literally engage with a hotel the same exact way and never meet a human in the process. Airplane, I’m checking in, I get in my Uber, I walk in the lobby, just zip through the lobby, go on the elevator, open my room, get in my room, get out of my room, leave, check out, never engage with someone. And what a missed opportunity. Because what you’ve done now is you’ve become a commodity. I need a bed and a shower, you give me a bed and a shower. There’s nothing more about it. How do you make a room memorable? A room is not memorable. Marble is not memorable. Art is not memorable. It’s really the people that make those things memorable. It’s not about the art. It’s about the artist who created the art and what was going on in their heart and soul and brain that makes the art more valuable. Even if it’s so abstract, even if it’s paint thrown on a canvas, if you really understand how we came together and engage with that artist indirectly through a curator, through a docent, through something, that’s why the art matters. So I think the danger for us is following the airline model without having that piece where I can connect with you. So my view on technology is we are dinosaurs. We hotels are absolute dinosaurs. Again, back to my example of the booking engine. Hotel people, I love you. I do not want to go to the OTAs to book my room. Please don’t fight me every step of the way when I’m trying to book my room on your website. Make it easy for me. Because by step 75, if you are making me change my keyboard from numerical to alpha, guess what I’m doing? I’m going to Expedia, sorry. One, two, three, room book. We are dinosaurs when it comes to technology. We have a great opportunity to adapt. Be fast at it because we are historically dinosaurs. Remove the friction. My view on technology is its job is to remove the friction. So when I walk up to you at the desk, Karen, don’t ask me to sign here and initial there and stick my credit card here and show you this and do that. The airlines have figured out to remove all of that. Why haven’t we? Allow me at that moment in time when I come up to you at the desk to ask you, what’s your favorite FOSS spot in town? What should I do? What’s around the corner? How do I do this? How do I get that? Like, allow me to engage with you. Because, and I talk about this a lot in Nazi and frankly, everyone who follows me will be like, oh God, here he goes again. I’m going Darwinian on you. You ready? Karen Stephens – 00:10:31: Yeah. Bashar Wali – 00:10:32: We are tribal animals. We need each other to survive. We have not evolved enough past that yet. Maybe someday we will. But right now we all want to feel like we belong. And when you remove the humans out of the transaction, you are shelter. You are providing me the very lowest thing on Maslow’s hierarchy of need that we human needs. We all need shelter. And if you are just shelter to me, man, that is an expensive way to sleep for one night, paying you four, five, eight, nine thousand dollars. If you don’t give me a reason to say, oh, this is my place. I belong here. Sure, I’ll admire your design and your art and your scent and your lighting. All these are important. But ultimately, in my opinion, if I don’t connect with you, you’re just a place. I walk in, I walk out, I get what I need, I move on. So we are not using technology enough to remove friction. We still have a lot of friction points. And by the way, another interesting thing is I tell people, you’re badly mistaken if you think you are in any other business other than retail. You are retailers. Hoteliers, you are retailers. You have perishable inventory. If you don’t sell that room tonight, it is gone forever. You can’t resell it tomorrow. So don’t fight me when I’m trying to buy from you. Allow me to buy seamlessly and then find a hook for me to become loyal to you so I’m not shopping anyone else. Karen Stephens – 00:11:41: Yeah. Can you give an example? So again, if we’re removing the friction and making the booking easier, making the experience and check-in easier, can you share an example of how a hotel experience can foster deeper connection or how humans in the loop can make sure that that happens to create that loyalty and that impact? Bashar Wali – 00:11:58: And again, I feel like I’m sick and tired of hearing myself tell the same stories again. I’ll give you an example I use often. Back to the airline business. Status on Delta, top status. I walk up to the gate. I look on the screen. I see my name at the top of the screen for the upgrade. Sure, I’ll take your upgrade. I’m not complaining. But my brain says, wait a minute. Bashar didn’t get an upgrade. I’m nobody. I don’t matter to them. I’m a record number. Record number 5789 that flew this many miles, that has this much status, that bought the ticket at this time, gets to the top of the upgrade. I’ll take your upgrade. But that doesn’t push that button in me that says, hey, you’re important. You matter. And we all want that. We all desperately want that. We desperately want to matter. Back to Maslow’s hierarchy of need, triangle, bottom is shelter, oxygen, water. The very top is transcendence and self-actualization. And self-actualization to me means, Aaron, you see me. I matter to you, right? That’s what hits that button that I’ve arrived. Now I’m at the peak of my species. So I get on the plane. I got the upgrade. Great, fine. I didn’t get the upgrade. The record got the upgrade. I paid my dues to get that upgrade. You didn’t do it for me. Sitting on that plane, I get a handwritten postcard from the pilot that says, dear Mr. Wali, thank you for being a million miler. Thank you for continuing to fly with us through the pandemic. You’re the reason we fly. I am king of the world. I am blown away. So in hotels to be more tactical and kind of stop being so philosophical and nebulous, if you want to accomplish that same idea, to me, the future of luxury is ultra personalization. Forget what color M&M I want on my pillows. That’s so true. Trivial and inconsequential. I’ll give you an example. I’m top status on Marriott. I’ve stayed in hundreds of Marriotts across the globe. Hundreds. I like my room 64 degrees year round. You would think once someone says, hey, we know this customer is a good customer. 20% of your customers give you 80% of your business. We should know that he likes his room cold. I’m going to push a button because technology allows us to do that. I don’t even need to go to the room anymore. Energy management system to drop the temperature for him and take credit for it. Leave a little note that says, hey, we know you like your room more temperature. You’re all set. Hope you enjoy it. Because that wins my loyalty. Not your damn points. Because points are not loyalty. Points are bribery. Come stay at my hotel. I will give you a point. If I stop giving you points, are you still coming? No, that’s not loyalty. I’m buying your loyalty, not earning it. So I think there are a lot of simple ways. But to me, really, it is about ultra customization. And that could mean, by the way, let’s be clear. The biggest luxury for me, single biggest luxury is time. We just don’t have enough of it. So if you want to give me luxury, don’t waste my time. So that may mean I don’t want to talk to you. I don’t want to engage with you. I want to choose to. Don’t force me to. So when I show up at 11 p.m. to check in for a one night stay, you know, I’m leaving at seven. Why are you telling me about the spa? Does it look like I care about your spa or your gym? So those to me are honestly emotional intelligence at the end of the day is where it boils down to. If we can focus enough on helping our team learn and foster emotional intelligence, read the room, read your customer. I don’t need ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen. I’m not a gentleman. Don’t call me by my last name. Don’t send me a butler. Give me what I need. So I tell people when I interview people. And by the way, I have a bunch of jobs open. We have new hotels opening. I don’t care about your Cornell. I don’t care about your whatever. I care that you have common sense, which is very uncommon and have emotional intelligence. People, we are not curing cancer. This is not that hard. All you have to do is be nice and read the room. That’s it. Kind of like at home. When you have company at home, read the room, Karen. If the music’s too loud, read the room. Turn the music down. Right? Like it’s so simple, yet so hard. Karen Stephens – 00:15:34: I love that. I’m over here laughing. It’s so true. I think the other thing that really hit for me. So first of all, ultra personalization. Yes. And then the second thing is and take credit for it. In other words, you don’t have to be like, you know, but just a little note in the room. Bashar Wali – 00:15:49: Take credit for it. Karen Stephens – 00:15:50: Yeah. It’s a morgue temperature in here on purpose. Bashar Wali – 00:15:53: Absolutely. Take credit for it. The other piece I’ll touch on on technology. Again, look at retail, right? Like I mean, look at Amazon and Instagram and you don’t even have to say it anymore. You think about it and it shows up. Like I feel that if we wanted to, we have the ability to. Karen, I can for very little money tell you how many times you went to the bathroom in your room, how long your shower was, whether you flushed the toilet or not, whether you washed your hands after you’ve used the toilet or not. We can dig so deep in on you to really get to know you. I am shocked. And maybe I’m wrong. And if someone thinks I’m wrong, please correct. That Marriott, the largest, doesn’t have an entire department with a bunch of MIT PhDs that are data scientists that are saying, okay, what can we learn about Karen and how do we put it to work to her benefit? Not big brother, not breaching any privacy issues. I know there’s a lot of people concerned about that. But for example, I have a routine, right? Business traveler. I walk in the room. There are five things I do every time. So if you know that every time I walk in the room, I turn the temperature down and I put the TV on, pick a channel, CNN. Think how magical that would be for me. To arrive in the room, have the temperature be down and the TV be on CNN. Because now I’m loyal to you. You know me, you get me. But nobody thinks about loyalty in that lens. We keep thinking about bribery, throw points at them, extra points. Oh, great. So that’s where the magic is lost. But you make a good point about take credit for it. Because if I don’t know, I won’t know. I’ll assume it’s a coincidence. Maybe, oh, they put the TV on CNN. It happens to be what I watch. Great. But if you say, hey, not to every guest, by the way, you’re a thousand room hotels. You’re not sending a thousand handwritten notes. And by the way, for those who don’t know, you literally can buy a machine, a robotic machine that has a pen, not super expensive, that will write handwritten notes for you. So you can’t write a thousand notes handwritten with a pen. But take credit for it. Because taking credit for it is your way of showing me love and showing me that you care about me. Karen Stephens – 00:17:42: Yeah, that’s amazing. The other thing I want to pick up on is just talking about points, even in the airline or with hotel. It’s like you earn those points because you’re on those planes all the time, in those rooms all the time. So that’s not a reward for me. That’s a road warrior. You know, that’s something in my career that makes me be here all the time. Bashar Wali – 00:18:00: It’s the price of admission, right? Like it is the price of admission. And funny, by the way, you see those who get it, they’ll show up at an independent hotel with no points. They’ll open their wallet and there’ll be every top status card in their wallet that you see. They’re not choosing you for the points. Again, listen, and we’ll talk about the other kind of a traveler in a minute. But those who are seeking the experiences, they’re not choosing you for the points. But if you give them the points, sure, they’ll take it. But they’re not gonna sacrifice the experience for the points. So if you happen to have a good experience and you give them points, okay, great, bonus. But that’s not what they’re coming there for. Now, in fairness, there’s a lot of hardworking people out there who are barely making it, who will go out of their way to a lesser experience to get the points because that’s how they take their family on vacation. I am not knocking those people. But they are doing that consciously and they’re doing thoughtfully for a reason. So no knock on those point chasers because I get why they’re doing it. But if you’re touting your ability to attract people based on experience, my argument is you don’t need points. Karen Stephens – 00:19:00: Well, we talk about this a lot at Revinate. We deal with a lot of independent hotels and small groups. And it is about the experience and tailoring that experience and making sure that people understand even beyond the hotel, what’s in the local area that’s going to enrich your whole stay. So we think about that a lot. Because if you don’t have 30,000 rooms, points really don’t. It takes a long time to do. Bashar Wali – 00:19:22: And we talk a lot about CRM, and I think people throw that word around and they don’t know what it means anymore. CRM isn’t sending a guest an email to have them come back and stay. It’s a complex journey from beginning to end to build customer relationship management. Relationship. We think about it transaction. I have a need period. I’m going to send you an email to come stay with me. That’s not relationship nurturing. Relationship nurturing is having a dialogue with you ongoing in any different way, whatever that means, a newsletter or whatever. It’s not always about look at me, look at me, come by me, come by me. So I think we need to better define CRM in our industry broadly and what it means back to this ultra customization issue. Also, we back to again, Marriott to pick on them for a minute. You should know everything about me, but what are you doing with that information? Nothing. As far as I’m concerned, nothing. And by the way, the same example I gave you about the upgrade on Delta. I mean, I’m a hotel ops guy. I grew up in the business. When you get an amenity in the room, Karen, don’t get excited. I don’t know who you are. You’re just a name on a list. I print a list that says, here are the VIPs. Karen is VIP level one. You send her this amenity. So it’s very impersonal unless it is personal where someone found out something about you, knew you liked, how do you do melon or whatever? I wrote you a note to take credit for it. Hey, this is not just an amenity that everyone gets. Karen, we know you like honeydew and we sent you honeydew specifically because then it’s not an amenity. Then it’s like, holy crap. I love these people. How did they know that about me? Karen Stephens – 00:20:41: Yeah, it really does feel like that too. I admit it. Bashar Wali – 00:20:45: Transactional, all transactional. Karen Stephens – 00:20:47: Right? That’s so true. Okay. You mentioned Instagram. So let’s talk a little bit about the Instagramification of hotels. How do you think this trend is shaping how hotels market themselves and what should hotels be doing to tell their brand story more effectively using digital? Bashar Wali – 00:21:02: As I vomit in my mouth at the very thought of Instagrammable moments. So I often say, do good work. Funny, I tell designers, if you win an award for doing this project for me, I will never hire you again because now the award is the only thing you’re thinking about. So you will do things that make no sense, that have no basis. And in reality, because you’re chasing that nebulous award. What I say is do good work and the award will come. And similarly, do thoughtful things that naturally become Instagrammable moment. Don’t go put a sign on the world, a wall that says, this must be the place you have arrived. La la la la. Like we’ve seen them all now. And when cool becomes ubiquitous, it’s not cool anymore. When there’s a checklist on how to be cool, that is the definition of being uncool. Do not follow that checklist. So this never ending Instagrammable moment, has become almost our purpose and our North Star to a fault. It makes no sense. Sometimes what we do with it as no context, it has no basis. If you are thoughtful about what you do, I love those two words, thoughtful and intentional. Don’t just put a piece of art on the wall because it’s a good piece of art. Make sure it resonates. It has meaning. It has purpose specifically. And the way you could tell your story through digital, which is super important, obviously, and I’ll give you a real life example in a minute is make sure that the work that. You’re doing to tell the story has those moments of surprise and delight. I hate that term too. It’s very hotel nineties. But the idea is like, if you’re trying to tell me a story about this historic building or this location or this market or this destination or these people or whatever it is that you’re celebrating or this forest or this river, find a moment that’s interesting. That’s elegant, intentional, and thoughtful that you believe will naturally become the Instagrammable moment. Don’t start the process by saying, let’s find the Instagrammable moment out of this thing and put it on the wall. We’ve story. And you know, when you’re reading a book and there’s a, maybe an illustration that’s beautiful and it grabs your attention. That’s how I think of it. But that illustration is a part of the story. It’s not just some random thing thrown on a wall that has no context whatsoever to the story. So that’s how I think about Instagrammable moments. They are important. We have to use digital. The example I was gonna give you is I take my kids on separate trips every spring break across the globe, one-on-one and often I’m the neurotic hotel guy. I’m gonna pick the hotel. So last time I went with. My daughter, seven countries in 10 days, literally I said, you’re in charge. You go find the hotels. Here’s your parameters. Here’s the budget. Here’s the quality, et cetera. Don’t tell me. And I promise, cuz I’m known to be whiny a lot about that stuff. I’m like, I will shut my mouth and I will accept it. Literally every hotel she picked in seven countries across the globe that we’ve never been to, except for one I had been to were spectacular. I would have never found them. And she found them all on TikTok. So dear hoteliers. Sure. It’s nice to be in The New York Times. So. I can go to a cocktail party and brag to my friends that my hotel made it in The New York Times. That’s not how people are buying today. If you’re not on digital and all in on digital, you are asleep at the week. You’re the guy who back in the nineties said, oh, that internet thing is a fad. It’ll go away. The future is short videos, real time user generated. It can’t all be shiny influencer, sexy bikini. That kind of like early on when we, the TripAdvisor, right? Like it was so good cuz it was user generated. You could rely and trust it. People are far more sophisticated now and they can read through the BS that we might serve them. So it has to be authentic, but that’s where the future is. And you have to create places in your hotel that are a conducive for these customers that are paying you to help you tell your story for free. They’re doing your marketing for you. Don’t get in their way. Let them walk around with their selfie sticks. Let them have the right, proper lighting. Make sure your wifi is fast enough. That’s how you foster those people to allow them to come brand evangelists for you across the globe. But absolutely the future, a hundred percent across the spectrum from luxury to select serve is digital. Like got email who opens email and reads email anymore. Are you kidding me? But it has to be, it can’t be, oh, let’s do a reel for TikTok tomorrow. No, no, no, no. It has to be a bonafide, well thought out, thoughtful and intentional strategy. That is a long-term strategy. It’s all let’s spend a thousand dollars on TikTok next month. Oh, we got no money out of it. Forget to no, no, no, no. It has to be part of your marketing plan. Karen Stephens – 00:25:20: I love that because I do think that kind of the old way of thinking is what is our social media strategy? We’re going to do X amount of posts per week. We’re going to blah, blah, blah, blah. And what I’m hearing you say is create the environment and the experience. And obviously your hotel has to be great. And then those guests are going to come in and they will do your marketing for you, especially the younger generations, right? I was skiing the other weekend and there was a guy at the top of the mountain, you know, had his whole coat off taking pictures with the lake behind. I mean, it was like, what is going on? But I just realized, hey, that’s a generational thing. And they’re the new buyers. Like I’m reading the The New York Times. They’re looking at TikTok. Bashar Wali – 00:25:59: And they’re influencing their parents, also the younger ones. Like, by the way, Karen, you think you’re the decision maker? You’re not. You’re gonna listen to those kids. They’re gonna influence their decision-making for you. And to your point, let the consumers do the hard work for you, but you still have to have your own strategy. And of course, influencers are very important. And I think influencers, it’s become a dirty word almost, but those that are good at it and know what they’re doing are very accretive and valuable. But we also get caught up in the ROI. And I get it. I’m an owner and an operator in some cases. We all want ROI. But you can’t spend a dollar on Instagram and expect to get $7 back because there’s this idea of brand recognition. Why does AT&T pay 40 million bucks to put their name on a stadium? They’re not saying, how many more phones or plans have we sold as a result of this? They’re saying, we want our name to be front and center. So I think of those campaigns as two separate ones. There’s the name recognition that you can’t put an ROI on because it’s a long-term brand strategy. Then there’s the direct campaign. I have a sneak period. I want to succinctly do a campaign to generate traffic to this hotel during that period. What do I do? And you can’t do it the day before. Like this again, has to be a strategy in place, kind of like sales plans and marketing plans. You created the beginning of the year. 90% of them sit on a shelf and nobody looks at them ever again. It has to be a living documents that changes every day because habits change, platforms change, and timing and need periods change. And I think we’re not using digital enough because sadly, the industry is dominated by middle-aged white dudes and they all want to be in the The New York Times and they all want to be in that whatever. I would much rather be mentioned in Goop than be in the The New York Times. I mean, that’s again, we’ve got to shed the old thinking. I call us the middle-aged white dudes, not white, but the double-breasted shiny suit guys who still think that thing is in style. Although maybe it is coming back now. Like we’ve got to shed the notion that we know everything and really listen and learn because we do not know everything. And if you think you know everything today, literally go home and retire because you’re dead. You’re going to be a has-been and so fast, you won’t know what hit you. You’ll be five minutes ago. We have to pay attention to what’s happening in real time. And things change so fast today. Back in the old days, think about revenue management. Back in the old days, you met once a month, you set the rates for the month and that was it. You’re done with revenue management. Now it’s like a stock market ticker. You have to watch it like a hawk and yield and how you yield those rooms. There’s talk now of Karen, if you want to sit in the restaurant at the table by the window at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, the menu is dynamic. The menu prices will change because the idea is you want premium and that’s where technology can help you maximize your returns, be agile and nimble because how do I do that now? Print different menus for different hours for different tables. But whether it’s a QR code, which by the way, I hate it’s that the QR codes are over, but there are a lot of ways to create dynamic pricing across all things we do to allow us to maximize. And by the way, allow Karen who can’t afford this restaurant at 7 p.m. On a Saturday to come at 5 p.m. On a Monday and get a really good deal. So it’s good for us for maximizing our revenue and it’s good for the consumer because now they could choose what their budget is and what fits in that budget. Karen Stephens – 00:29:10: Right. Wow, that’s fascinating. I think digital strategy, we talk about this a lot, the long game and the short game. And again, that’s kind of borrowed from retail and traditional marketers. But hoteliers need to think of that as well. Brand building is not a short term activity. It does not have ROI out the gate. It’s something that, that goes over time. I’m telling you, my VP of marketing right now is jumping up and down because we talk about this all the time. Bashar Wali – 00:29:32: Well, again, and what I said to you earlier is we don’t think we’re retailers and we really need to change that narrative. We say, oh, we’re in the guest service business. No, no, no. Guest service is what you do to make what you make at the end of the day work. Your job is to sell those rooms day in and day out. That’s the only job you have. Karen Stephens – 00:29:49: Right. Okay, so I have one last question for you. So as a hotel operator, as someone who’s been in the business, has owned a lot of hotels, has had different brands and now with the two companies you’re with now, there’s a lot that hotel operators are dealing with. And what is your piece of advice? I mean, if you just think about the context that we’ve already got staffing shortages, costs are just going up, up, up. So I feel like the struggle for an operator at this point is to figure out how to do all of these things and stay alive. Maybe that’s dramatic, but one piece of advice for operators. Bashar Wali – 00:30:18: I wish I’d give it to myself if I had it. I mean, look, fundamentally, I am a true believer in the hire people that are smarter than you are and get out of their way. And that’s becoming harder and harder to your point about the labor market and now the immigration issue and deportation issue and how that affects our industry, et cetera. It has been a really, really rough go for us. Prices continue to go up. Margins continue to get squeezed. The big get bigger and make it harder for us little guys to kind of go chase it. I hate this idea of us being service providers, view the service provider. Karen, if you own a hotel, me being your service provider is very transactional. You’re hiring me to provide you a service and you’re paying me a fee for it. I think we’ve forgotten the idea that the way for this to be successful for both of us, this is a relationship. This is a partnership. I want to be your partner, your owner. I don’t want to be your service provider because by being your partner, it changes our collective perspective. We’re at the table together. Your concerns are mine. I’m helping you think your concerns. You’re invested in my success because my success is your success. I feel like there’s a lot of tension now between owner and operator. It always seems like it’s a fight. And I think the best example, obviously, is when you are the owner and the operator because now you control everything. But in the example where you are a service provider, our services become commoditized in a way by the big boys that have 1,500 hotels and will do it on a month-to-month basis for nothing, basically. If you want those guys, you can have them. They’re going to be your service provider. My advice to people in my space is you have to be a partner to your owner. You have to understand their hopes, their aspirations. You have to set their expectations realistically from the get-go. Don’t over-promise and under-deliver. And don’t under-promise and over-deliver. Really, it’s kind of like a marriage or any relationship, for that matter. I think any relationship has to be built on the foundation of trust. If you don’t have trust, you have nothing. So we don’t spend enough time really getting to know our customers, our partners, our owners, establishing that trust relationship. But make no mistake about it, a good friend of mine described this management business as a knife fight out there, and it is a knife fight. At the end of the day, care and owner, if you’re a partner, if you want the commodity person, I’m not your person, I will make you connections to lots of people who will do it cheaper, faster. It just depends on what you want, and that might be the answer for you. But if you really want a partner, here, I’ll give you the silly analogy I use. You and your spouse are trying to have kids. It’s hard, hard, hard, hard. Finally, after years and hundreds of thousands of dollars, you have your baby. Blood, sweat, tears, money. Because that’s what hotels are to many developers. They’re not transactional. They’re passion, they’re children. And now you and your spouse want to go out to dinner. So you’re like, well, what do I do with the baby? Do you hire someone to manage your baby? Is that what you do? Manage is such a passive, transactional word. And that’s how we viewed it. So now my example now, you have this hotel, blood, sweat, and tears. You’ve agonized for months over what feeling that doorknob will give you when you open it, how tactile it is. And you’re going to give it to someone to manage? So the words I’d like to use back to the baby context is, you want someone to love, care for, nourish, nurture your baby. If you don’t think about it in those lens, and if I don’t think about it in that lens that you’re handing me your baby that I should love and cherish and grow, it’s transactional. I’m just managing your baby. I mean, think about literally that terminology. So I think, again, we’ve gone away from that whole inner person. Chip Conley was a genius at this with Joie de Vivre. His job wasn’t running hotels. His job was really engaging the owners. The owners didn’t hire J.D. Vitor on their hotels. They hired Chip Conley. Chip Conley knew their kids. He took them out to baseball games. He was a friend. He was their partner. And that’s why those relationships were successful because they were all built on this interpersonal thing and not just transactional. So if there’s any piece of advice I will give you is if you think of yourself as a service provider, I get paid to do the job, then fine, there’s a place for you. But if you really want to do something unique and different is you have to think about this as a partnership, a marriage, a relationship, and nurture it. You can’t just take it for granted. You can’t get the deal, send the show pony in to get the deal and walk away. It’s like any relationship. You have to continue to nurture and water it and feed it and take care of it for it to thrive. Karen Stephens – 00:34:27: I love it. Well, thank you, Bashar. I really appreciate the conversation. Bashar Wali – 00:34:31: Thank you. Delighted to be with you.

ByKevin Holden Platt ByKevin Holden Platt, Contributor. ISS Commander Suni Williams helps test out an Astrobee free-flying robot, outfitted with mechanical ... More octopus tentacles to capture dead satellites and hyper-speed space debris, as she orbits the planet at 28,000 kilometers per hour. Free-flying Astrobee robots now being tested on the International Space Station could give rise to incredible guardian spacecraft that halo the ISS and protect it from super-speed shrapnel threatening the lives of all its astronauts. Three years after an exploding cloud of shards from a Russian anti-satellite missile - speeding toward the ISS at 28,000 kilometers per hour - sparked NASA to order the Station’s astronauts to seek refuge inside their escape capsules, leading robotics experts are conducting experiments that could one day lead to a futuristic defense against similar threats. A constellation of ISS spacefarers, including just-returned Station Commander Suni Williams, has been overseeing tactical demos of the fantastical bots. In their current configuration - resembling aliens that are part machine and part sea creature - they almost appear to have taken flight from a Transformers film, and from the future into the present age. The three Astrobees - identical triplets - launched to the orbital outpost started out their lives with a remarkably different mission, says Jonathan Barlow, who heads the Astrobee Project at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, the American space agency’s freewheeling fountainhead of invention and radical experimentation. Each Astrobee is outfitted with internal propellers to fly, along with three smartphone-class ARM processors and a suite of six imagers, including a high-resolution video camera and two leading-edge LIDAR time-of-flight sensors, that combined allow the airborne robot to map and navigate its surroundings. The International Space Station is a technological wonderland, and the globe's greatest platform to ... More conduct demos of next-generation space robots. (Photo by NASA/Space Frontiers/Getty Images) Initially, Barlow says, the highly autonomous Astrobees were designed as mobile cameramen that can glide across the Station and stop in mid-flight to film ISS astronauts, and as sophisticated platforms to host experiments devised by guest scientists across the outpost’s allies. Each floating robot can be operated by the NASA Ames Astrobee team, or by the ISS astronauts via their laptops, who can program hours-long sorties for them to fly through, or tele-operate the droids move by move. Barlow, a vanguard aerospace research engineer who helped develop the Astrobees and their Robot Operating System-derived software, tells me in an interview that his Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames has joined forces with a dynamic space-tech outfit to transform the flying machines as precursors to a future stage of missions: capturing satellites that have exhausted their propellant or even out-of-control space debris that increasingly threatens the high-traffic rings of low Earth orbit. Inventors at this partner outfit - Kall Morris Inc - told me they’ve outfitted the Astrobees with next-generation biomimicry technology to empower the robots to capture free-floating space objects. They’ve engineered a complete metamorphosis of the ISS bots, which have been armed with an array of octopus-like tentacles, fitted with gecko-inspired adhesive pads, that can ensnare even spinning nanosatellites. This hybrid astro-octopus, they say, can now capture space objects measuring up to 6.5 meters in diameter - the size of the Webb Space Telescope’s mirror - adhere to it with gecko “clingers,” and propel it into an alternate flightpath. Fantastical Astrobee flying robots, enhanced with an array of octopus-like tentacles, practice ... More capturing simulated satellites floating across the Space Station. Starting last summer, onetime test pilot Suni Williams helped guide these Astrobees through a series of fascinating maneuvers as they chased and deftly captured simulated CubeSats floating across the Kibo module of the Station - all as forerunner flights to hyper-tech debris removal sorties in times ahead. Barlow’s team at NASA Ames, and his KMI partners, liaised in real-time with Williams, a former Space Shuttle astronaut, as she oversaw these demonstration flights 400 kilometers above the globe. So far, the enhanced Astrobees have already captured more than one hundred “target spacecraft” inside the Space Station, and a new sequence of these chase-and-seizure demos is slated to start in early April, just weeks after the arrival of a new contingent of ISS astronauts, says Troy Morris, who heads the Michigan-based KMI. Even as its cutting-edge robotics tech is tested across the microgravity platform of the ISS, Morris tells me, his skunkworks lab is developing a new spacecraft, called Laelaps, that will be equipped with more powerful Space Octopus features to rendezvous with and take control of dead satellites and spent rocket stages that now crisscross and threaten low Earth orbit. The robots and orbital flyers being developed by KMI are at the forefront of a nascent campaign - stretching from North America to Europe to Asia - to begin clearing heavily traveled orbital lanes of the spacecraft and shrapnel that could threaten future human spaceflight, the ISS and the space stations set to be lofted by independent aerospace operators. The Laelaps now being perfected by Morris’s group might one day be deployed like a celestial ring of protectors around the ISS, prepared to capture any debris - from missile fragments to castaway rockets - determined to be on a precise collision course with the Space Station. The immediate focus of his studio, Morris says, is on demonstrating autonomous docking with and relocation of orbiting satellites and spacecraft that have lost their ability to maneuver. A target CubeSat is captured by an Astrobee robot inside the Kibo module of the ISS Yet much more complicated, potentially live-saving missions are being mapped out for the future, he says: “The concept of deploying a fleet of autonomous satellites to safeguard critical infrastructure - such as the ISS - against collision threats is compelling and something we are exploring conceptually.” In a series of captivating papers, Morris and co-founders of KMI have pinpointed 198 rocket bodies, launched from the U.S. since the start of the Space Age and now spinning around the planet at up to 2000 kilometers in altitude, that would make optimum targets when the American government begins funding active debris removal operations. “The population of artificial objects in Earth orbit has increased steadily since humanity began utilizing the space environment decades ago,” Morris states in one study. “Currently the U.S. Air Force tracks over 44,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters in Earth orbit.” “Should these objects collide,” he adds, “debris clouds would form, setting off a domino effect of more collisions” in a potential orbital doomsday called the “Kessler Syndrome.” Meanwhile, as his robotic spacecraft advance their ability to intercept runaway space objects, Morris says, KMI could “provide our protective services to the ISS, other stations, and the growing needs of all space operators.” Back on the International Space Station, the re-engineered Astrobees are set to whiz through a new series of aerial war games, tracking and overpowering their hovering prey. After collaborating with iconic NASA aeronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on these zero-gravity exercises, Troy Morris says, his lab is set to team up with a new corps of ISS sojourners. Just-launched astronaut Anne McClain, who has extensive experience in drilling the Astrobees from an earlier trek to the space-lab, might be a strong candidate to lead the new round of tests with the revamped droids, Morris predicts. When asked if the future-tech progeny of the Astrobees might one day be deployed to shield human spacefarers, including those inside the colossal International Space Station, from incoming threats moving at hyper-speeds, Jonathan Barlow at NASA Ames says the potential to create robotic spacecraft acting as celestial sentinels “certainly seems like a cool idea.” “I think that something like that, you know, guardians outside of a space station could, yeah, could definitely happen.” Since being launched to the Station five years ago, Barlow says, the Astrobees have spearheaded a spectrum of breakthroughs - including advances in human-robot interactions by connecting up with astronauts and aerospace wunderkinds of the future. The space-bots have already generated circles of acolytes across American campuses, Barlow adds, via boosters like MIT’s Zero Robotics tournament, which challenges high school creatives to program Astrobees to race through a series of maneuvers with deftness and style. During the early rounds of these nationwide competitions, he says, would-be operators of the robots code them to speed across a simulated ISS. Yet the ultimate round - the championship - he adds, “is on ISS with real astronauts and real Astrobees.” Suni Williams lauds the tournament, and says she had a blast teaming up with students during the final Astrobee match on the Station. Iconic astronaut Suni Williams says she had a blast teaming up with young programmers competing to ... More maneuver the Astrobee robots across the ISS during the Zero Robotics championship staged by MIT During her first press conference back on terra firma this week, Williams suggested this orbital Olympics for aero-robots might also help NASA discover its astronauts, coders and inventors of the next generation. “We did lots of experiments up there with kids and universities,” she said, “and trying out new guidance and navigational control, and robots that were flying inside of the Space Station.” “That is pretty awesome that you can really touch and talk to kids on the ground as you are doing experiments up there.” “And they have their finger on the pulse of science experiments.” “And they can understand that,” the superstar astronaut added, “and think to themselves ‘I can be part of this someday.’”
