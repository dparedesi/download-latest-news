REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ruled out the likelihood of the controversial sale of its global ports to a BlackRock Inc.-backed consortium being completed this year but stayed optimistic about the deal’s prospects after inviting a Chinese investor into the mix. A transaction wouldn’t be completed this year even if binding agreements are settled sooner, said CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt at an analysts briefing following the release of its interim earnings results on Thursday. He pointed out the complexity involved in the deal, which covers 43 of CK Hutchison’s ports including two in the strategic Panama Canal. If completed, the sale could net the conglomerate founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing more than $19 billion in cash. “We are in a new stage of our deal and that includes, as we have said, discussions with a major strategic Chinese investor,” Sixt said. “I believe that there is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included, and most importantly, that will be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.” The comments came amid uncertainties over the fate of the geopolitically fraught deal, which has become a proxy for the rivalry between the US and China. While President Donald Trump hailed the sale as a win over the Panama waterway, Beijing has expressed strong displeasure over the sale, seeing it as a betrayal to the nation and kowtowing to American pressure. CK Hutchison shares swung between gains and losses in early trading on Friday, after first-half results released Thursday showed profit plunged 92% due to a one-time, non-cash loss from a merger. Through Thursday’s close, the shares had added 25% this year. The company has already missed a chance to ink a definitive agreement before a window for exclusive talks with the buying consortium expired in late July. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the buying consortium, which also includes Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., people familiar with the matter have said. While the discussions have taken longer than expected, the group doesn’t see it as particularly troublesome because the port operations have been performing well this year, Sixt said. The company reported a 9% increase in revenue at its ports and related services business for the first half of the year, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 10%, mainly due to higher throughput and storage income in regions including mainland China, Asia, the Middle East, Mexico and Europe. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Trump administration hopes AI can mitigate staffing losses, federal CIO says

Kevin Carter/Getty Images Stay Connected By Natalie Alms The Trump administration is “100%” looking to artificial intelligence to make up for the loss of thousands of employees across federal agencies, a top Trump administration tech official told Nextgov/FCW in a recent interview. “I think [AI] is the number one thing that is going to help people mitigate the staffing shortages,” said Gregory Barbaccia, the chief information officer for the U.S. government, a position with oversight of the federal government's technology that’s housed within the Office of Management and Budget. Barbaccia, who's also been identifying himself as the federal chief AI officer, was a former longtime employee at data analytics company Palantir. In one of his first interviews after about eight months on the job, Barbaccia spoke with Nextgov/FCW about the administration’s vision for AI and how it intersects with the White House’s push to shrink the size of government through both layoffs and voluntary incentives. Since Trump took office in January, over 148,000 civil servants have left the federal workforce. The biggest challenge in his role, Barbaccia said, “is how to do more with less — how to still have the level of efficiency, following up on your agency’s mission for the taxpayer, operating in an environment of lean staffing.” “AI is a huge part of that, so that’s a major focus for me,” he added. Another priority is data, Barbaccia said. Enterprise data platforms — central systems connecting data from across an organization — are “what’s going to power AI and advanced analytics to actually get people [sic] more efficient,” he said. “AI is going to be a huge part of this, all these manual, repeatable tasks.” “What AI needs to be doing,” Barbaccia continued, “is collating and collecting this data that a human needs to make a decision and getting it to them in a way that makes sense, in a way that's quick, so they're able to make a decision with all the information they need as quickly as possible.” Barbaccia’s remarks come days after the launch of USAi, an evaluation platform meant to help agencies adopt AI models from Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI, some of which recently cut deals with the government to offer their software for nominal fees. Proponents of AI say it could aid the government in making sense of its vast troves of data, support federal employees and offer real-time help to people seeking government assistance without them having to call agency phone lines. “How do we use tech to take the excellent humans that we still have and make them as efficient as possible?” Barbaccia said of AI. “How do we get them doing what they were doing before, but doing it way faster and better?” The “holy grail” is “if we're automating more things that can be done by a computer, what are humans doing that they could not do before?” he added. Max Stier, the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service — a nonprofit focused on good government — told Nextgov/FCW in a statement that “federal leaders, as stewards of public funds, have an obligation to leverage cutting-edge technology to address our collective problems.” “The federal government can and should take concrete steps to enhance the technical capacity of its workforce to fully take advantage of all the possibilities AI has to offer,” Stier added. “The civil service needs to evolve, but it cannot be replaced by AI.” Those more critical of AI have cautioned about its potential to cause harm or automate bias at scale, a point especially relevant as the Trump administration has targeted so-called “woke” AI. Critics say that cracking down on AI tools deemed to be too woke could chill both free speech and AI-focused risk management in government agencies. There’s also questions about the reliability of the technology — generative AI models can produce plausible-seeming but ultimately false outputs called hallucinations — and the fact that many agencies have lost staff that would presumably be called upon to implement new AI solutions. “It's very early days for the use of AI in government services. But what we do know is that the approaches that work well are those where the employees drive the process of integration in a bottom up and grounded way,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, the director of the Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination and Redesign at Brown University who did a stint in the Biden administration. “What doesn't work is firing government workers who have expertise and then trying to use AI to replace their years of knowledge and experience,” Venkatasubramanian said. “And what certainly doesn't work is forcing the remaining workers to be constrained to use only AI tools that conform to Administration speech requirements. Fast is not synonymous with better, and in fact is often the opposite of it.” As for the data to power AI, the Trump administration is already pushing agencies to more easily share data, and its Department of Government Efficiency has been at the center of many headlines and lawsuits over its hoovering up of government data. In the spring, Wired and CNN both reported that DOGE is building a “master database” with data from different agencies to track undocumented immigrants. The New York Times also reported on the expanded use of Palantir across the federal government. House Democrats also issued a whistleblower-informed report in April alleging that DOGE was building a cross-agency database of sensitive information from the IRS, SSA and other agencies. Barbaccia maintained that he doesn’t know of such an effort. “I can’t find it for the life of me,” he said. “I have no insight into any sort of master database going on. I asked agencies at IRS and SSA. They don't have anything they're building outside of their internal data. I've asked the vendors who are in the news, too. They're not tracking what the news is about.” “I think it’s people misunderstanding what different vendors do,” he said.

Title: Keeping Figma weird: Inside tech’s design darling after a blockbuster IPO
URL: https://sfstandard.com/2025/08/18/inside-figma-ipo-public-san-francisco-tech-office-tour/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T16:40:33Z
Full Content:
Two weeks ago, Figma CEO Dylan Field traveled east to do something increasingly rare for a tech leader: ring the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. His design software company, which he cofounded 13 years ago as a college student, had gone public. By day’s end, Figma was valued at roughly $68 billion — one of the most explosive IPOs in decades, joining the ranks of Uber, Airbnb, and Snowflake — Field’s net worth soared past $5 billion. (In the weeks that followed, the stock had dropped 31% and the market cap had settled in at $38 billion.) But while its founder basked in Wall Street’s embrace, at the company’s San Francisco headquarters, Figmates (as employees call themselves) faced a new challenge: retaining the company’s playful, eccentric culture without succumbing to the pressures of the public market. Figma, which creates collaborative design tools, occupies four floors of the Phelan Building on Market Street. It’s an aesthetic wonderland, with the brand’s bright colors splashed onto exposed brick columns, murals by local artists covering the walls, and vibrant rugs pulling the space together. “We try to have our brand feel similar, both digitally and physically,” said VP of design Noah Levin, who has been at Figma for eight years. “It feels kind of like a party, like a space where you want to come in and make something fun.” Unlike most other tech companies, Figma has no return-to-office mandate. But on a recent visit, hundreds of employees opted to show up in person, enjoying a catered breakfast and a pop-up Vietnamese coffee bar. One staffer typed on a laptop while petting a chihuahua-terrier mix; another chipped away at a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Employees were crowded into the office for the company’s annual “Maker Week” tradition, in which they pause regular responsibilities in favor of passion projects. The mood felt like a return to tech’s euphoric, utopian years of the 2010s — quite out of character with Silicon Valley’s current shut-up-and-grind, perk-cession era. “Figma is just a bunch of wonderfully friendly nerds solving hard problems and having fun while doing so,” said Nikolas Klein, a product manager from Germany who joined the company as an intern eight years ago. That “friendly nerd” spirit shows up in unexpected ways. During the pandemic, employees wrote and performed the 20-minute musical “Figma in Quarantine,” and the San Francisco office’s arts-and-crafts studio houses a growing crocheted quilt. Now that the company is public, its executives are trying to shield workers and the Figma culture from the demands of quarterly earnings expectations through organized play. “In normal times, the stock price probably would constantly be hanging over us,” said Sho Kuwamoto, VP of product. “But these are not normal times.” Everything you need to know to start your day. As AI allows more people to generate software without any coding background, superior product design will become a distinguishing factor, he said. “So as long as we keep helping people accomplish that, the issue of stock price will take care of itself.” When Kuwamoto joined a decade ago, Figma was located in a tiny Minna Street alley and had no product. What began as a Brown University dorm project in 2012 is now a juggernaut with 13 million monthly active users and $749 million in annual revenue. Figma’s products have become so popular that Adobe, the largest design company by market cap, planned to acquire it for $20 billion in 2023. But after antitrust pushback from the U.K. and the EU, Adobe abandoned the merger, paying Figma a $1 billion breakup fee in the process. One recent Maker Week project was hatched when five employees from various departments gathered in a 10th-floor meeting room called “Muffin Hands.” Their goal: automate the company’s meeting icebreakers. None were engineers, but within five days they had vibe-coded a working prototype — a gumball-machine-like pop-up that spits out prompts such as, “What’s your favorite way to eat potatoes?” or “What’s your best meeting with a celebrity?” “These ideas aren’t just for fun,” said Levin, who helped produce the company’s musical. “They can inform our product roadmap.” Since 2018, Figma executives have purposefully set aside time for the annual tradition centered on creativity and cross-team collaboration. Past Maker Weeks have yielded core products such as Figma Slides and an add-on for Google Classroom. “Normally at these sorts of things, engineers just get really competitive, and everyone else gets excluded,” Kuwamoto said. “Here, it is genuinely about finding joy in your work. That’s how you get the best output out of people.” Five years ago, Figma employed about 150 people and just one outside the U.S., in London. Today, the company has 1,600 employees at eight global offices in addition to its San Francisco headquarters. As it continues to grow, Chief People Officer Nadia Singer is being intentional about preserving the company culture. “There are some things we want to evolve, but there are some things we want to keep forever,” Singer said. Those include not only the ability to deal with ambiguity but the potential for ideas to come from anywhere. Kylie Chang joined Figma this summer as an intern, helping to build AI enhancements for the company’s tools. What stood out about the 19-year-old’s résumé wasn’t her Ivy League pedigree but that she started playing around with Figma in middle school and used it to design an app that functioned as a virtual museum for her artwork. “It’s easy to strike up conversations here and ask for help,” Chang said. “It’s surreal getting to work on a product I grew up using all my life.” And did she get stock options? “I was paid in great memories,” she said.

Major U.S. equities indexes were little changed Monday morning, ahead of retail sector earnings reports and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell due later in the week. Dayforce (DAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 following a report that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is in discussions to acquire the human resources software provider. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) also advanced after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker’s popular Wegovy weight-loss medicine to treat a serious liver disease. First Solar (FSLR) and other solar stocks gained in the wake of new guidance from the Treasury Department on federal tax incentives for clean energy projects. Citi and Jefferies analysts said the release was better than anticipated. CVS Health (CVS) shares rose following an upgrade from UBS, which pointed to the drugstore and healthcare company’s cost-cutting and improving healthcare benefits division. EQT (EQT) shares fell as the energy provider was downgraded from Roth Capital Partners on concerns an oversupply of natural gas will send prices down and hurt EQT’s results. Oil and gold futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. TradingView

Title: Who Killed the Narrative Podcast?

By Eric Benson “I have a hook for your story,” a podcast producer told me as soon as I called her up earlier this summer. “Pineapple Street announced it’s going out of business today.” I’d already been reporting on the collapse of the narrative podcast industry for several weeks, talking with executives and editors and producers. Everyone had pretty much the same thing to say: things were looking grim. But this news felt personal. I’d hosted and written two shows for Pineapple Street Studios. I had several close collaborators who were still on staff. Even when I was just a fan of podcasts, I knew the name Pineapple Street — it was a pioneering production company and industry leader. They’d made the mega-hit Missing Richard Simmons in 2017, then spent almost a decade churning out award-winning narrative shows like The Catch and Kill Podcast, Ghost Story, and Hysterical. A few years ago, Pineapple Street going out of business would have shocked me. But when I heard about its demise on that Thursday afternoon in June, it felt sad but inevitable. If you haven’t been paying close attention, the idea that a segment of the podcast industry is existentially imperiled may seem counterintuitive. More people than ever are listening to podcasts and talking about podcasts and thinking about starting their own podcasts. Politicians trying to win elections are clamoring to go on podcasts. (When they lose, it is blamed, in part, on not going on the right podcasts.) A recent report from Edison Research estimates that 55 percent of Americans over the age of 12 consumed a podcast in the last month, an all-time high. But the podcasts that are thriving are talk shows — increasingly celebrity-driven talk shows — that are cheap to make, can easily be turned into streaming YouTube videos, and command big ad dollars. Narrative podcasts — the multi-episode, investigative journalism–fueled shows that boomed after the release of Serial in October 2014 — have followed an inverse trajectory. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century For years, narrative podcasts were the buzziest segment of the industry. They were what many listeners thought of when they heard the word “podcast.” Many of these shows, following the lead of Serial, were true crime, while others, like Slow Burn, took a similar investigative approach to politics and history. But regardless of genre, most narrative shows shared a style — they were told through the perspective of a single reporter-host, who not only guided a listener through a story but invited them along on the reporting journey. Now, these shows seem increasingly like an artifact of history. Layoffs have hit nearly every organization that makes this kind of audio, from corporate behemoths like Spotify to successful start-ups like Pushkin Industries to the public-radio godfather of it all, This American Life. In early August, Amazon announced it was dismantling Wondery, one of the biggest and most commercially successful studios in the business, which had made its name on shows like Dr. Death and The Shrink Next Door. Amazon had acquired Wondery less than five years ago for $300 million. Now, the company was being broken up into parts and a reported 110 staffers were laid off. “It feels like podcasts speed-ran the development of an industry to the decline of an industry,” the journalist and podcast host Evan Ratliff told me. “It went from people were making absolutely no money, to people were making fortunes big enough where they’d never have to work again, to ‘There’s not a budget for that’ in less than 10 years.” Now, even those reduced budgets have vanished. The fall of the industry has been so vertiginous that it’s been hard to fully comprehend its decline. But in many ways, this collapse was baked into its spectacular rise, when a flood of dumb money, pollyannaish entrepreneurs, and hungry journalists rushed to build an industry that would soon turn into a house of cards. YEARS BEFORE I STARTED MAKING podcasts, I thought I was already too late to get in on the craze. This was the mid-2010s, and after Serial, it felt like every other month brought another expertly crafted narrative series. There was the first season of In the Dark, and S-Town, and Missing Richard Simmons—podcasts that not only got millions of listeners but were covered in the mainstream media as events. They got picked over, debated on social media. They felt like they mattered. So when my friend Matthew Shaer asked me if I might be interested in making a podcast with him in the spring 2017, I leapt at the opportunity. Related Content 'The Yogurt Shop Murders' Director on the 'Cursed' Story That Haunts Austin 30 Years Later Four Things We Learned From Netflix’s New Son of Sam Docuseries They Were Accused of a Brutal Murder. Can She Prove Their Innocence? Margo Price Keeps the ‘Bastards’ at Bay on Rolling Stone's New Podcast ‘Nashville Now’ Matt told me he’d happened upon a story about a Florida State University law professor named Dan Markel who had been shot to death outside his home in Tallahassee in 2014. Two alleged hitmen had been charged in the case, but authorities believed the masterminds behind the murder were family members of Markel’s ex-wife. Matt had tried to pitch it xas a magazine story, but he’d struck out, which turned out to be a lucky break. The Markel case was convoluted, had tons of backstory, and there was hours of archival audio from police wiretaps and stings. In other words, it was perfect for a podcast. Matt and I spent months developing the idea, then we pitched it to Wondery, which was fresh off its first big hit, Dirty John. Within a couple weeks, we’d signed a contract to make a six-episode show. We wanted to call it Tallahassee. Wondery’s CEO Hernan Lopez, a shrewd former television executive, opted instead for the crass but grabby Over My Dead Body. He said he liked titles that were phrases people actually said. In mid-February 2019, the night before Over My Dead Body was released, Wondery hosted a launch party at the Ace Hotel in New York. They billed it as the “exclusive world premiere of 2019’s next blockbuster.” Lopez, Wondery’s CEO served as master of ceremonies, insisting that all the attendees blindfold themselves while listening to the first episode. Afterward, Matt and I went to dinner with Marshall Lewy, Wondery’s chief content officer, who told us about his attempt to court an Oscar-nominated screenwriter to adapt Over My Dead Body. That particular screenwriter had declined, but it hardly mattered. The show hit number one on the Apple podcast charts and stayed there for weeks. That summer, the actress and director Elizabeth Banks optioned the show for development. In 2019, the movie and TV industry just couldn’t resist a good podcast. “My friends in Hollywood would be like, ‘People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about graphic novels or comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies,’” Jenna Weiss-Berman, the co-founder of Pineapple Street, tells me. “Then everyone was like, cool, this is going to be an amazing business.” “People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies” In truth, narrative podcasts had always been a strange business. Requiring months (and sometimes years) of reporting and an exhaustive writing and editing process, they were expensive to produce and struggled to attract enough advertising to pay for their budgets. (Weekly chat shows, with their consistent audiences and parasocial relationships between host and listener, were always a safer bet.) The Hollywood money could help close the gap, and when a show struck big like Wondery’s The Shrink Next Door — which had a purchase price of $1.25 million and numerous associated bonus fees — narrative podcasts could turn a tidy profit. But podcasting still seemed like a relatively modest offshoot of magazines and public radio. Then Big Tech changed the math entirely. A week before the Over My Dead Body launch party, Spotify announced that it was acquiring the podcast studio Gimlet for a reported $230 million. Spotify had been looking to reduce its dependency on record labels while also becoming a one-stop shop audio company, and Gimlet — which made highly produced shows — was a key plank in that strategy. To most people in the industry, Spotify buying Gimlet made sense, but Spotify buying Gimlet for $230 million seemed, to quote one longtime producer, “totally insane.” (As Brian Reed, the host of S-Town, noted to me, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for a similar sum in 2013. ”A five-year-old podcast company being valued at the same amount as one of the biggest legacy media brands ever — that, to me, encapsulates the bubble we were in,” Reed says.) Gimlet had routinely struggled with profitability. Now, their founders and investors had cashed out for a quarter-billion dollars. ”It was like Spotify dropped a wallet in the street and Gimlet picked it up — it could’ve been any of us,” one former podcast executive told me. It wasn’t long before other wallets started dropping. In August 2019, Pineapple Street, a considerably smaller company than Gimlet, sold to Entercom (later rebranded Audacy) for $18 million. In July 2020, the New York Times bought Serial Productions for a reported $25 million. That December, Amazon announced its $300 million bet on Wondery. These companies weren’t buying narrative podcast shops because they thought narrative podcasts were a can’t-miss business. They saw them as part of their grand corporate maneuverings. One former Pineapple Street staffer tells me an Entercom executive had said during the acquisition, “We don’t need you to make money. We want you to make shows we can brag about.” Soon, Sony, Apple TV+, and Amazon were aggressively commissioning narrative podcasts from independent producers, too. New companies like Campside Media (co-founded by my Over My Dead Body reporting partner Matthew Shaer) cropped up to feed the beast, churning out narrative series for the big players while hoping they might follow Pineapple Street and Serial Productions and get acquired for a spectacular fee. As money swelled the ranks of the industry, it also gave it a sense of staying power. Narrative podcasts couldn’t be written off as a fad. They were a new medium, the savior of longform storytelling. A day after Spotify acquired Gimlet, the National Magazine Awards unveiled the finalists for their first-ever podcasting prize. Later that year, the Pulitzer Prizes announced they were adding an “audio reporting” category. Podcast hosts like Serial‘s Sarah Koenig and S-Town’s Brian Reed were going on late-night shows. Hulu was launching its Emmy-winning comedy series about true-crime podcasters, Only Murders in the Building. Big-time print journalists like The New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe were jumping into the world of narrative podcasts and loving it. Keefe tells me that not only was making his show, Wind of Change, one of the “happiest, most creatively fulfilling experiences” of his career, but he saw audiences respond to it in a lasting way. “On book tour, there are always people who show up, having read none of my books, and want to talk about Wind of Change,” Keefe says. I was feeling optimistic too. Over My Dead Body had been just the beginning for me. I made a campaign-trail podcast for Texas Monthly called Underdog: Beto v. Cruz; I was reporting and writing the investigative true-crime series Suspect and executive producing a story of drug-smuggling and police corruption called Witnessed: Borderlands. Then there was my show Project Unabom, about the 18-year manhunt to find Ted Kaczynski, which I’d gotten greenlit off a pitch that was barely a paragraph long. I was busier than I’d ever been, and I was already discussing new projects that would keep me occupied for the next 18 months. At the time, I was a staff writer for Texas Monthly, which had once seemed like a dream job. But in December 2020, I quit. I wanted to write and produce podcasts full time. I had caught the bug. I wasn’t the only one. IN THE SUMMER OF 2016, Connie Walker was looking for a new way to tell stories. She was a television reporter at the CBC News in Toronto, where she specialized in covering indigenous issues. She had a big audience, but she also found that she was frustrated by the quick-hit nature of TV news. Walker is Cree and grew up in the Okanese First Nation in rural Saskatchewan, and she wanted to bring history and context into her stories. Almost always, she had to leave that on the cutting room floor. Podcasts had been a revelation. She’d gotten hooked on Serial and was inspired by its immersive approach to storytelling. So she pitched her bosses on a podcast about the unsolved 1989 murder of Canadian woman from the Gitxsan nation. Walker’s bosses were television people. They’d never overseen a podcast before, but they cautiously agreed. She had a tight deadline and a tiny team, but plenty of editorial freedom to tell the story of an indigenous community in the way she wanted. “I think for a long time there was just this feeling that our stories weren’t important or that Canadians wouldn’t care,” Walker tells me. “And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams? debuted that fall, and it quickly found an audience. Walker tracked the ins and outs of the case, but she was after something larger: “We started this story looking for answers about Alberta Williams’ unsolved murder, but the deeper we got into the story the more I thought about the bigger questions,” Walker says at the beginning of the fourth episode. “Why are there over 1,200 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada? My hope in telling Alberta’s story is to begin to connect the dots.” “For a long time there was this feeling that our stories weren’t important. And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Within a couple months of the show’s release, Walker was connecting even more dots, reporting a new season that tracked her search for a long-ago missing Cree girl named Cleopatra Semaganis Nicotine. But midway through production, Walker’s manager told her that it would be her last podcast. “She was like, ‘This takes too long. It’s too expensive. This is it,’” Walker says. And I was like, ‘it hasn’t even come out yet.’ And she said, ‘management doesn’t support it.’ Missing & Murdered: Finding Cleo was a breakout hit, but the CBC stuck to its decision. Walker went back to making television, but soon she was looking for a new employer. In the summer of 2019, she was invited to meet with a few executives at Gimlet, which had just been acquired by Spotify. As soon as she walked into their Brooklyn offices, she was wide-eyed. The CBC offices looked like what you’d expect from a public broadcaster — drab carpeting, dated computers, refrigerators full of sad office lunch. Gimlet’s offices were all start-up pizzazz — designer furniture, gleaming cutting-edge equipment, break rooms stocked with free sparkling water and a cornucopia of snacks. Even better, Gimlet offered Walker its full editorial backing. “I was begging at the CBC, like ‘Please let me,’ and with Gimlet it was like, ‘What can we do to support you and your vision of the podcast?” Walker says. “It really was like a dream come true.” Walker’s Gimlet show, Stolen, continued the work she’d started with Missing & Murdered. In the first season, she investigated the recent disappearance of a young mother named Jermain Charlo, but in the second season, Walker broke the mold, focusing on a mystery involving her own father, Howard Cameron, and the abuse he and his peers suffered at the St. Michael’s Residential School, which had been established as part of a government policy of forced assimilation. It was a dark, personal story, and Gimlet gave Walker the time and the team to pursue the most ambitious work of her career. Gimlet’s largesse was worth it. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s won nearly every award for which it was nominated, including the Peabody and the Pulitzer. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was one of the strongest cases imaginable for the existence of narrative podcasts. The resources at Gimlet had allowed a reporter to investigate a deeply personal story, then broaden the scope until she’d crafted a furious indictment of institutional abuse and racism. Just as importantly, the behind-the-scenes transparency of the medium had taken what could have been a dry exercise in accountability journalism and injected it with the sizzle and suspense of a police procedural. And the voices of the survivors themselves gave it an intimacy and force that would have been almost impossible in another medium. But when Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was winning the biggest awards in audio journalism, Walker’s triumph was tempered by the fact that Gimlet itself was a husk of its former self. The problems had burst into public view two years earlier with accusations that one of Gimlet’s flagship shows, Reply All, had created a hostile work environment for non-white staffers. That had led to a reckoning inside the company and, within a little over a year, the end of Reply All. Other longtime Gimlet shows, which were siloed as “Spotify exclusives” and unavailable on other platforms, started bleeding their audiences. New shows had trouble gaining traction. In October 2022, Spotify, under pressure from investors to reduce costs, began culling its original podcast offerings, cancelling several Gimlet shows and laying off dozens of staffers. By the end of that year, Gimlet’s managing director, Lydia Polgren, and its co-founders, Alex Blumberg and Matt Leiber, had all departed the company. Then in June 2023, less than a month after Walker’s Pulitzer and Peabody wins, Spotify shut down Gimlet and put its few remaining shows under the mantle of Spotify Studios. In just four years, Spotify had turned $230 million into zero dollars. Spotify spared Stolen for a few months, but that December, it too was cancelled. The news wasn’t a surprise to Walker. “I feel like we knew kind of before we knew,” she says. She and her team were allowed to stay on and finish their third season, Stolen: Trouble in Sweetwater, but when its final episode was released in April 2024, they were all out of work. In some ways, this was familiar terrain for Walker, echoing her experience with the CBC. But the podcast industry was in a vastly different place in the summer of 2024 than it had been in the summer of 2019. Gone were the days when studios like Gimlet were flush with cash and hungry to buy up new talent. When Spotify cancelled Stolen and another former Gimlet show, Heavyweight, a company spokesperson said they would “work with the show creators to ensure a smooth transition for wherever these series go next.” But there was nowhere to go next for Stolen. When Walker reached out to podcast studios and media companies, they didn’t try to woo her at their venture capital-funded offices. She couldn’t get anyone to make her an offer at all. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s had felt like undeniable proof of what she’d been trying to convince people of for her entire career — “that these stories are important, that there’s an audience, and that they can have an impact.” But that moment had faded. Two months after Spotify cancelled Stolen, the company signed a new $250 million deal with Joe Rogan. THE NARRATIVE PODCAST INDUSTRY HAD always been an awkward mash-up of characters — public-radio true believers, Hollywood producers, magazine refugees, and eventually tech executives — and it had always been a little unclear what the goal of making these shows really was. Were they entertainment or journalism? Should their success be measured in awards and social impact, or by their ability to turn a buck? Did these podcasts exist principally for their listening audiences, or were they really, when you got down to it, just proof of concept for film and television development? The different segments of the industry always had different answers to these questions, but for a time, while the money was flowing, it felt like podcasts could be everything to everyone. The precious journalists could strive for their Pulitzers, and the wannabe Ari Golds could have their Hollywood deals. The answer to every binary choice was “yes.” But then the money started to go away. The tech and media giants that had funded the podcast boom had learned that narrative journalism was hard to scale. In 2019, it might have been enough for them to make shows that “we can brag about,” but a few years later, as recession fears grew, losing money on prestige programming no longer seemed like a good idea. “Podcasting has been a drag on the gross margin side,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in January 2023, “Some shows worked, some didn’t perform as we expected. And that is a sign of maturing. You go for growth first and then you seek efficiency.” As 2023 went on, Ek and his competitors tacked hard toward efficiency. “Places that were buying these shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000?’” Weiss-Berman, the Pineapple Street co-founder, told me. “Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” For years, the industry had been building itself up on the premise that the demand would only grow for prestige TV-like narrative shows and budgets would remain robust. When the big tech companies cut back, the first solution for the production companies that depended on them was mass layoffs. The second was closing up shop entirely. For anyone making a living in podcasting, the future started to look like finding a new line of work. “Places that were buying shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000? Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” At the beginning of this year, that’s how it was looking to me. I’d spent much of the previous two years writing and producing two shows that had both been killed by their commissioning companies. They weren’t bad. I’m pretty sure they were good. But they didn’t sound exactly like something that had come before, which meant they weren’t easily slotted into a pre-existing feed. By then, a conservatism had set in. The industry of “yes” was now beginning to resemble the worst of Hollywood. Creative executives, under pressure to churn out hits, were increasingly micromanaging the process, engaging in what one award-winning host described to me as a “firing line approach to editing.” In February, I finished up a show that actually got released, the Wondery podcast Death County, PA, which had showcased the high-impact prison reporting of the journalist Joshua Vaughn. Then, for the first time since 2018, I faced a world in which I had no offers for new podcast work. But I don’t know if I’m done with podcasts, even if a certain kind of corporate-backed, lavishly budgeted narrative show appears to be extinct. My favorite podcast from the last 12 months is called Shell Game, and in many ways it’s a playbook for what might come next. Hosted and reported by Evan Ratliff, a longtime tech journalist and one of the hosts of the Longform podcast, Shell Game is an experimental series about artificial intelligence, and in many ways, it’s a rejection of the compromises that had become baked into making shows for Big Podcast. “I knew it was going to weird,” Ratliff says. “And I wanted to be as weird as possible. I didn’t want to be forced into analytic conclusions about AI, the kind of places you get pushed by people who are trying to sell your show.” Of course, by the spring of 2024, when Ratliff started making Shell Game, he probably wouldn’t have found anyone to fund it anyway. But that was fine. Ratliff figured he could do it cheaply with a small team. He hired Sophie Bridges, a producer he’d worked with previously, and leaned on the expertise of his wife, Samantha Henig, who had founded and led the audio division of the New York Times. The tiny team didn’t diminish the quality of the show. And part of what’s so wonderful about Shell Game is it’s a story that could only exist as a podcast. Ratliff created an AI voice clone of himself and set it loose in the world. In the show, we hear AI Evan interact on the phone, often hilariously, with a series of interlocutors, starting with customer service representatives and scammers and building to two sessions with an unwitting human therapist via the online platform Better Help. Shell Game made several best-of-the-year lists, and Ratliff says it broke even. (The revenue came almost entirely from subscriptions to an affiliated Substack.) Then, it won a $50,000 prize from the Independent Media Initiative, which made it profitable. But breaking even is a tough business model, and prize money isn’t something you can count on. For Season Two of Shell Game, Ratliff is collaborating with the independent podcast studio Kaleidoscope, which has given him more a financial cushion while still allowing him to make the show he wants to make. “They’re into telling a story that sounds as far from any formula as possible and helping us try to do that,” Ratliff said. That’s how the future might look: smaller, more independent, more experimental, but also with fewer shows being made and basically no hope of striking rich. But that future is hard to see from the present. At the moment, the narrative podcasts that are making it to the top of the Apple charts are tabloid-y true-crime, often affiliated with TV shows like Dateline and 20/20. Pineapple Street has vanished, Wondery has been gutted, and many of the surviving production companies are trying desperately to pivot to weekly chat shows. Nearly every producer and editor I worked with in podcasting — across seven years and 12 shows — is struggling to find work. Some are piecing together freelance gigs doing field reporting for news-radio outlets. A few are staffing chat shows. One talented producer I know is now working for a fly-fishing magazine. Another started a successful food Substack. An entire generation of journalists who started in podcasting are leaving and are unlikely to return. And many of the most respected and experienced producers, editors, and reporters in the industry are out in the cold too. Connie Walker is one of them. When I spoke to Walker in late June, she was about to start a new job as a journalism professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. There, she’d be continuing the work she began in Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s, collecting the testimony of residential school survivors and building out an archive of the abuses that took place. That work is certainly worthwhile, but when we spoke, Walker was open about the fact that her “new dream” was to turn that work into another podcast. In retrospect, the boom years of narrative podcasting were always a kind of dream. When she went to Gimlet, Connie Walker felt like she’d won the lottery. Sometimes I felt like I had, too. Now, that era is definitively over. A few people got rich. Many more came out the other side with no job, and if they were lucky, a few months severance. Whatever comes next will be built up in the shadow of that history — that it all looked so good and that so many of us bought into the mirage. We want to hear it.

Title: META Stock: Path To 2x Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/18/meta-stock-path-to-2x-growth/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T14:10:21Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META stock (NASDAQ: META) has delivered 2x returns, rising from $370 in early 2024 to roughly $785 today. The company’s evolution into an AI-driven advertising leader, together with Instagram’s revenue strength and substantial infrastructure spending, creates several avenues for the stock to potentially double again. At just 28x trailing earnings versus Amazon’s 35x and Microsoft’s 38x, Meta screens as compelling value with meaningful upside. We’ll examine these drivers below. While META has rallied, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since inception. Also, see – What's Happening With UNH Stock? Meta’s recent results show accelerating growth across key lines. Q2 2025 revenue reached $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, and net income climbed 36% to $18.3 billion. Operating leverage is especially visible in advertising, where revenue hit $46.6 billion, a 21.5% increase. The 9% rise in average price per ad underscores Meta’s ability to command premium pricing through AI-enhanced targeting. Also, see – Meta’s Revenue Comparison. Meta’s core shift centers on AI embedded throughout its advertising stack. Llama models now drive ad ranking and content recommendations, marking a move from conventional social media ads to precision marketing. This is not merely a technical upgrade—it is producing tangible business results, with pricing power expanding quarter after quarter. The scale goes well beyond automation. Meta’s generative AI tools are gaining traction with users and advertisers, opening new revenue opportunities while optimizing existing placements. This positions Meta at the forefront of the industry’s transition to AI-powered marketing solutions. Instagram is Meta’s most valuable asset and fastest-growing revenue engine. The platform is on track to generate over half of Meta’s U.S. advertising revenue in 2025, up from just 7% a decade ago. This mix shift toward a higher-margin platform creates substantial room for profitability gains. Given that Meta’s global advertising revenue exceeded $160 billion in 2024, with nearly 40% from North America, international monetization remains a significant opportunity. As Instagram expands globally and rolls out new features, it provides a clear path for sustained revenue growth. Meta’s 2025 capital plans include state-of-the-art AI infrastructure, highlighted by a 5-gigawatt data center and over one million graphics processors. While the upfront spend is sizable, these investments help cement leadership in AI-driven ad optimization. The in-house Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program signals a push toward cost efficiency. By replacing older GPU-based servers with custom silicon, Meta can lower long-term infrastructure costs while boosting AI performance—building a durable edge in the AI arms race. Despite cumulative losses exceeding $60 billion since 2020, Reality Labs remains Meta’s largest untapped growth option. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called 2025 a “pivotal year for the metaverse,” suggesting a potential turn from pure investment to revenue generation. Although the division posted $4.5 billion in Q2 losses, a successful transition could unlock meaningful value. Hardware sales, virtual experiences, and “personal superintelligence” applications could create entirely new revenue streams over time. For Meta to double from here, the company needs consistent revenue growth of 15–20% annually alongside margin expansion. Key levers include using AI to further lift ad performance, scaling generative AI across platforms, monetizing new surfaces like Threads, and enhancing WhatsApp’s business features. Financial scenarios suggest revenue could surpass $265 billion within three years, with earnings nearly doubling from under $24 per share in 2024 to over $45 per share in 2028. Even holding current valuation multiples steady, the stock could exceed $1,300 in three to four years. If investors assign higher multiples on stronger AI execution and profitability, shares could reach $1,500 or more—constituting a true doubling from today’s levels. The biggest challenge is intensifying AI competition. Cost-efficient offerings like DeepSeek raise the question of whether Meta’s large-scale infrastructure will preserve its technological moat. Regulatory scrutiny of social platforms could also restrict data monetization, particularly in Europe and Asia. Macroeconomic risks matter as well. A downturn could weigh on ad budgets across Facebook and Instagram, and higher interest rates may make growth stocks like META less appealing than fixed income. Related – Buy or Fear META Stock? Meta’s path to a potential doubling hinges on successful monetization of its AI investments. Its dominance in social advertising, paired with aggressive AI infrastructure scaling, provides multiple routes to sustained growth. The opportunity is real, but execution risk is elevated as competition intensifies across core markets. For growth-oriented investors comfortable with single-stock volatility, META offers compelling upside. Those seeking steadier exposure to similar themes might prefer diversified options like the High Quality Portfolio, which participates in Meta’s growth story while managing concentration risk through broader exposure.

A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers get unlimitedaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here. OpenAI is piloting product discovery via ChatGPT’s “Search + Product Discovery” initiative. They’re exploring using uploaded feeds to power future buying experiences inside ChatGP. Fill out this interest form to apply. Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery.

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here. OpenAI is piloting product discovery via ChatGPT’s “Search + Product Discovery” initiative. They’re exploring using uploaded feeds to power future buying experiences inside ChatGP. Fill out this interest form to apply. Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery. Not by keywords alone, but by personas, use cases, and prompt formats. Your best-performing SEO and paid search keywords are still the foundation. They tell you: Use these to anchor your prompt strategy — but expand outward. As people become more savvy with how AI tools work, more and more shoppers are going beyond just typing in “best bed sheets.” They’re asking: Medium-length prompts: Longer, context-rich prompts: Your goal is to build context around your products that lines up with this kind of language and framing.

Title: The 100 Best Movies of the 1970s

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Listing the best movies of a given decade has become something of an IndieWire tradition over the last few years, starting with the countdown we put together for our ’90s Week extravaganza in 2022, continuing with the ’80s the following year, and… then abruptly jumping forward in time to the ’00s the year after that. The problem wasn’t that we don’t love ’70s cinema — the problem was that we love ’70s cinema way too much. And way too much of it. The prospect of putting together a top 100 list that still didn’t have room for the likes of “M*A*S*H,” “Brewster McCloud,” The Long Goodbye,” or “California Split” seemed deeply perverse, and that’s just accounting for the work of a single filmmaker. No “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”? No “That Obscure Object of Desire”? No “House,” “Holy Mountain,” or “Half a Loaf of Kung Fu”!? It’s hard to even see the point of trying, and some of you might find it that much harder after parsing the movies that ultimately made the cut now that we’ve finally decided to wrap our hands around one of the most vital — and turbulent — decades the movies have known thus far. Born from the chaos of the 1960s and screaming headlong into a future that still seemed to be up for grabs (even as fears, optimistically dubbed “paranoid,” began to deepen about the powers that really hold this planet in their grip), the films of the ’70s reflect a world that was trying to make sense of its own violent potential. It was a time of ecstatic creativity that saw the emergence of New Hollywood, blaxploitation, and a blockbuster culture that was more compelled by greatness than opening weekend grosses; that saw American cinema look up to the stars with one eye and back down towards its own past with the other. It was also a time of profound reckoning, as established giants like Med Hondo, Nagisa Ōshima, and Pier Paolo Pasolini confronted the rot of history with a clarity and fearlessness that has seldom been seen since. And perhaps more than anything else, it was a time of cocaine. Just incredible amounts of cocaine. In a decade whose movies were so vast and varied, cocaine might be the only thing that many of the ones on this list ultimately have in common. Cocaine and Al Pacino. So after much consternation we present to you, at last, IndieWire’s list of the 100 Best Movies of the 1970s. This article includes contributions from: Carlos Aguilar, Christian Blauvelt, Sam Bodrojan, Wilson Chapman, Jake Cole, Rance Collins, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, Alison Foreman, Proma Khosla, Ryan Lattanzio, Vikram Murthi, Tambay Obenson, Katie Rife, and Christian Zilko. IndieWire’s ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street’s “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY’ is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre’s ’70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22. A film like “The Sugarland Express” is proof that some legends are just built different. Directing his first theatrically released film at 28 years old, Steven Spielberg practically emerged from the womb with all of the characteristics that would make him the biggest Hollywood director of the next half century: the effortless command of spectacle that always knows when to take a backseat to storytelling, the buttery smooth camera movements that seamlessly shift focus without ever letting viewers know it’s happening, and his unapologetic sincerity and deep belief in the dreams of brighter days that Hollywood has always sold us. Many a modern viewer has watched “The Sugarland Express” expecting a trail of breadcrumbs that point to the development of a more mature Spielberg who directed his best films, but its pleasures are more immediate than that — “The Sugarland Express” is one of his best films, full stop. In Goldie Hawn’s Lou Jean, a young mom who will stop at nothing to get her baby out of the foster system, Spielberg found one of his most endearing protagonists. Her endless love, refusal to accept defeat, and good humor about the ridiculousness of riding in a cop convoy while holding an officer at gunpoint makes the character impossible to root against, and Spielberg is often happy to sit back and let Hawn’s charisma do all the hard work for him. “The Sugarland Express” is Spielberg at his funniest and most sincere, complete with stellar car chase sequences that foreshadow his blockbuster dominance, and beautiful shots of characters watching “Looney Tunes” that may well have laid the foundation for Sammy Fabelman’s eventual trips to the movies. Its legacy has been overshadowed by the colossal movies its director has made in the subsequent decades, but the film would be just as deserving of a spot on this list if Spielberg had never stepped behind the camera again. —CZ Agnès Varda’s “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t” is a musical about women’s rights, at once both polemical in its borderline-Brechtian lyrics championing birth control and body autonomy, and also eternally playful and inquisitive in the naturalistic study of its central duo’s friendship over many years. Classmates Pauline and Suzanne drift together and apart through the vagaries of life, each following a wildly different path but always retaining a connection to the other. Among other things, it is one of the most gently observed movies ever made about female friendship. One of Varda’s boldest experiments, the film blends various genres and styles. Inspired by a real abortion case, the film incorporates neorealist traits to the extent it casts one of the actual lawyers to recreate the court proceedings, but Varda also sidesteps into gorgeous tableaux vivants and adopts immersive editing patterns to convey the characters’ sense of time passing. And the occasional bursts of song add a dash of whimsy to topics the director takes seriously, using humor and warmth to bring into the open subjects that were still largely taboo in French society. —JC In a way, Edward Anhalt and John Milius’s script for “Jeremiah Johnson” crystallizes what Westerns have been chasing ever since: It’s spare, unfussy, and full of poetic character. But for all the ways in which “Jeremiah Johnson” has proven enduring and influential, this under-appreciated classic is a truly singular film at heart — a portrait of a true ‘70s loner who just happens to be living in the Rocky Mountains in the 1840s. Drawing inspiration from period vernacular and the poetry of Carl Sandburg, Anhalt and Milius’s script is laser-focused on the search for what really matters in life, and the search that happens within oneself. Director Sydney Pollack, proving his extraordinary range and gifts, opened himself up as well to find this movie in the edit, a seven-and-a-half month assembly process following a shoot all over the snowy wilds of Redford’s adopted state of Utah. Far more than “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “Jeremiah Johnson” is the real birth of Sundance — many of the landscapes here seem just a stone’s throw from Main Street in Park City. The result is both purposeful in the writing and loose enough to let in a real feeling of life, the kind of experiential rhythm that you can’t find in a studio. This is as quiet and most introspective as Westerns get. It also has one of the ultimate ‘70s cinematic moments, an instant that sums up the spirit of the decade onscreen better than maybe any other bit of dialogue. While those opposed to the Vietnam War burned their draft cards, Jeremiah Johnson deserts the army altogether, who were then fighting the Mexican War. Sometime after his abandonment of the fight he encounters a patrol of soldiers and asks if the war is still going. So much time has passed that the patrol’s officer isn’t sure which war he means. “The war against the president of Mexico,” Jeremiah clarifies. “It’s over!” comes the response. So then Jeremiah asks, his tone of voice perfectly calibrated to convey a mix of mild curiosity and ultimate indifference: “Who won?” —CB One of the great Upper East Side movies, Paul Mazursky’s feminist romantic dramedy “An Unmarried Woman” is also one of the most emotionally intelligent American movies of the 1970s: The story of Erica Benton (Jill Clayburgh), who must come to terms with her husband (Michael Murphy) leaving her for another, what-else-but much younger woman, and set out on the healing and hopeful path to reclaiming herself later in life. (While Clayburgh was in her mid-30s when Mazursky shot the movie, something about her feels older, wiser.) But “An Unmarried Woman” is also a sharp feminist text and richly lived-in-feeling portrait of New York City life. Clayburgh’s superb performance, which was Best Actress-nominated at the 1979 Academy Awards after winning that prize at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, has a deft and deceptive lightness that gives Erica a sort of floating-through-life, almost gossamer quality that makes her at times tricky to read (and so therefore more fascinating to watch). It’s also extremely cathartic for the audience. Though Erica, an art dealer, eventually gets acquainted with Alan Bates as an abstract painter, “An Unmarried Woman” isn’t a romantic comedy in search of a match for its leading character. It’s a more naturalistic, minor-key character study that feels closer in spirit to an indie, landing on a great punchline of an ending as Erica trudges with a giant oversized painting in her arms down the streets of SoHo, a painting given to her by Bates’ artist. That Erica refuses to settle for an alternate relationship is what makes the empowering “An Unmarried Woman” so remarkable and even groundbreaking today. But just imagine that take in the 1970s, barely a few years into Women’s Liberation. —RL In the cinema of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, “The body keeps the score” is as true of the Earth itself as any human who trods upon it. Wielding a style of punishing austerity achieved through meticulous composition, movement, and editing, the filmmakers arrived at a singular meeting point between the classicism of John Ford and Charlie Chaplin and the avant-garde modernism of Robert Bresson and Bertolt Brecht. “From the Clouds to the Resistance” is one of the finest displays of their oeuvre, a testament to human struggle against oppressors ranging from ancient Greco-Roman myths of defying the gods all the way up to the antifascist resistances of the 1940s. Beneath its deliberately anti-dramatic surface of long takes and unemotional delivery of declamatory dialogue, the film communicates with lyrical beauty. Tree branches are used as proscenia to theatrically encase actors, and eyeline matches subtly establish power dynamics between their characters. Small fluctuations in natural light hint at shifts in those dynamics as one person or another asserts will against the other, and multi-planar compositions of landscape evoke painters like Cézanne while also silently testifying to the incalculable gallons of blood spilled on hills and dales over the course of human history and its endless wars. And for all the filmmakers’ Brechtian distance, they ultimately present a deeply human thesis of the capacity to endure and oppose even the harshest regimes of control. —JC Politically incisive director Lindsay Anderson found in Malcolm McDowell a wide-eyed and peculiar vessel to examine the economic inequities and ideologically corrosive nature of post-war British capitalism. Here, in the picaresque second film of their Mick Travis trilogy, McDowell embodies the perpetually cheerful lad as a coffee seller whose ambition and disposition earns him a rare upward mobility. As Mick travels across the U.K.’s northeast selling his unethically sourced product, his quick ascent and eventual downfall is interspersed with Alan Price’s musical performances. With lyrics like “Sell everything you stand for” or “Someone’s got to win in the human race/ If it isn’t you, then it has to be me,” the tracks are far from conspicuous, but their inclusion lends a cheeky undertone to a film that’s brimming with latent darkness. Anderson and screenwriter David Sherwin insert Travis’ evolution from idealism to disillusionment into the larger context of the Britain’s blood-soaked imperial past and its enduring consequences. As Travis becomes aware he’s just a disposable pawn, susceptible and perhaps even powerless to the whims of a system designed to chew him up and spit him out, McDowell’s expression turns from curious to utterly defeated. The character’s “luck” has ultimately run out. —CA Chris Marker’s three-hour ciné-essay takes a look over the preceding decade of global leftist movements and their various failures, from the student protests across the west to pushes in Soviet states for greater autonomy from Moscow. It is the latter that often proves the most compelling material for how little it has been covered in the west; in one of the film’s most transfixing sequences, Marker plays footage of Fidel Castro publicly declaring support for the Soviet Union’s invasion of Czechoslovakia to repress protests, lingering on the Cuban leader’s ambiguous expression for hints of self-awareness at betraying the higher ideals of revolution for self-determination. Marker’s pioneering form of half-studious, half-associative history has arguably become more relevant in recent years than it ever was during his lifetime, a clear forerunner to an entire genre of video content devoted to obsessive exegeses of politics and pop culture. Adam Curtis in particular is inconceivable without this film, but Marker’s overriding sense of play avoids the pitfalls of conspiratorial frenzy that besets so many of his successors. —JC Lino Brocka’s 1975 genre-bending fable is so dexterous an affair that you’d be forgiven for accidentally underselling it. It is a queer melodrama, a sociological survey of Marcos-era Filipino life, and a rollicking mystery. Without ever dulling the film’s gritty, anti-colonialist messaging, “Manila in the Claws of Light” remains prime entertainment. It feels miraculous that the film even exists in the first place — that Brocka did this, in front of a camera, with this many people, that it looks this good, and that it released to international success. Yet none of the aforementioned qualities are what lingers most vividly between individual viewings. The most striking aspect of the film is the infrastructure: The dirt piles next to a construction site, the market stalls built from sheet metal, the hand-painted menus at a restaurant. Brocka’s camera focuses so intently on these spaces because of he cares so passionately for the people whose spirit threaten to be crushed by merely inhabiting them. When I think about “Manila in the Claws of Light,” this is what first comes to mind. —SB In 1973, the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney decided to adapt a 19th century book about the feminist history of witchcraft into an animated prog-rock musical about a medieval peasant girl who gets gang-raped on her wedding night and then turns to Satan for help with her revenge. This is really a thing that happened. See it even once and you’ll never forget that it did. Strange even by the psychedelic standards of its time, Eiichi Yamamoto’s wild and exhausting “Belladonna of Sadness” is a sinister anime fairytale inspired by the same fetish for medievalism that gripped Jacques Demy and Pier Paolo Pasolini, layered in recursive prog-rock jams, and filled with enough vaginal imagery to make Georgia O’Keeffe blush. From that imagery erupts the film’s vivid approach to sexual violence, as the heroine’s assault is symbolized by the sight of her naked body being cleaved in two down the middle like a butchered animal carcass, blood flying out of wound in the form of bats that flap off into oblivion. Few movies have ever so viscerally depicted the psychic toll of such trauma — the crime’s power to tear a person apart from themselves. Smarter than it is salacious, the film’s narrative complements its Eurocentric art style, further distancing “Belladonna of Sadness” from the world of hentai and locating it instead in a Western history where women are positioned as angels of liberty, and witchcraft their way of rebelling against institutional misogyny. History has a habit of prizing women for their sexuality one minute and punishing them for it the next, and Yamamoto’s film reflects that dynamic down to its core. This is a story about men who are in the thrall of a woman’s beauty, and then enraged by their inability to control it. It continues to prove moving, even in its (budget-enforced) stillness. —DE A tumbleweed-like tour across a broken country that’s trying to get back on its feet as the horrors of the Vietnam War come to a close, Jerry Schatzberg’s painfully unforgiving “Scarecrow” is a story about two drifters who give each other a sense of direction even though neither of them has anywhere left to go. Max Millan (Gene Hackman) is a short-tempered ex-con who looks askance at everyone he meets. Frances Lionel “Lion” Delbuchi (Al Pacino) is a stunted and guileless former sailor who dreams of reconnecting with his ex in Pittsburgh — and of becoming a father to the child he’s never met. These odd vagabonds make for a strained and unlikely pair of friends, but Lion’s puppy dog naivete turns out to be the perfect counterweight to Max’s cynicism, and it isn’t long before these two men are supporting each other in a way that no one else ever has. Shadowed by a deep and implacable darkness from the moment it starts, “Scarecrow” endures — and even offers its own strange kind of comfort — because of the lightning-in-a-bottle frisson it captures between its lead characters, whose tetchy dynamic was reflected in the conflicting styles of the actors who played them. Hackman’s introspective reserve clashed with Pacino’s method immersion, and though both actors were at the height of their powers, it took all of their combined talent to make it through a scene without snapping. That barely contained explosiveness lends an extra poignancy to the strength that Max and Lion give to and take from each other; it builds and builds until the point where their friendship starts to seem like it could point towards true north in a world that’s lost its moral compass. Alas, it leads them somewhere else in the end, as “Scarecrow” resolves as an indelibly American reminder that moving forward isn’t as simple as finding a way to get there. —DE Robert Bresson shook up his image as an imposing, aesthetically spartan moralist “Four Nights of a Dreamer,” which unmoors his usually materialist cinema into the realm of fantasia. Inspired by Dostoevsky’s short story, “White Nights,” the film follows the relationship that forms between a suicidal young woman and the stranger who attempts to convince her to live. Bresson retains his economy of storytelling to capture the caution with which both people open up to each other, but elsewhere he indulges in the most delicate and effervescent camera work of his career. At times, the film verges on comedy, if not outright self-parody. In a brief film-within-the-film moment, Bresson renders the bare plot as a quasi-thriller as if to show he could make more traditionally crowd-pleasing fare if he wished, and he reworks the ending of the source story as a bleakly funny punchline on the smitten protagonist’s presumption of possible romance with his rescued damsel. And yet, the underlying interest of Bresson’s filmography — the elusive search for truth in any of its forms — is as present here as his more feted works. For Bresson, the “meet-cute” becomes a means of unpacking the entire spiritual possibilities of love. —JC When talking about ‘70s culture, words like “paranoid” and “anti-establishment” loom so heavily in the air that it’s easy to lose sight of their meaning and use them exclusively as aesthetic descriptors. But even after 50 years, a film like “Dog Day Afternoon” makes it impossible to reduce the social unrest it depicts to grooming choices and editing styles. No amount of philosophizing disgrace and criticizing fears could convince a viewer that the society Sydney Lumet depicts isn’t on the brink of collapse — or, at the very least, isn’t convinced of its own imminent downfall. Even by the comparably low standards of the antihero-loving ‘70s, Sonny Worzik is not the kind of hero that a healthy civilization turns its eyes to in times of need. A chaos agent with all the poise of a chainsaw juggler in their first day on the job, his impulsive bank robbery devolves into a hostage situation in the blink of an eye. Fueled by little more than a deep belief that nobody’s promises are worth the paper they’re printed on, his make-things-up-as-he-goes approach to negotiation is the work of a man who feels so utterly invisible that he’ll settle for making enough noise to be noticed. On a technical narrative level, “Dog Day Afternoon” is as gripping a thriller as they come. As a social artifact, it’s one of the definitive examples of the chaos that was seeping into every crack of the American consciousness. Sonny only gains momentum from his admirers as he invokes the Attica prison riots, cultivating the crowd’s anger into a collective demand to see someone, anyone, do something to upset the powers that be. It’s all futile, as there’s only one way that a movie like this can end, but few films have ever reflected that futility with so much fire. —CZ Nicolas Roeg’s “Walkabout” was only the British director’s second feature after 1970’s “Performance” heralded him as an independent moviemaker to watch — and one with a special predilection for unique cross-cutting that felt like a fascinating new riff on the French New Wave. With one of the decade’s most indelible prologues, his film thrusts us into the arid wilds of the Australian Outback, where two English schoolchildren (played by Jenny Agutter and Luc Roeg, the director’s son) are unceremoniously dumped by their depressed father after he tries to kill them, and only ends up killing himself. At the same time, their paths as they try to survive in the desert collide with a Black Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil, who went on to have a huge film career of his own after this breakout debut) who is on the rite-of-passage journey of which the title gets its name. Still streaked by Roeg’s nihilistic worldview despite the potentially heartwarming center, the unsentimental and briskly told “Walkabout” is also a brutal and unsparing portrait of survival in the wilderness. And speaking of cross-cutting, it’s perhaps most famous for a scene in which Agutter is seen swimming naked, juxtaposed against Gulpilil mercilessly hunting down Outback wildlife. “Walkabout” is a movie all about juxtapositions — man vs. nature, the modern vs. the ancient, the landscape vs. the colonial human forces cutting into and against it. But the tenuous bond that forms between the siblings and the boy, who doesn’t speak a lick of the English language, suggests in cinematic terms how those opposing forces ultimately could (and should) coexist. —RL Akio Jissoji careened from the populist Japanese TV of “Ultraman” to the heights of the nation’s avant-garde with this, the first of a trio of films inspired by Buddhist philosophy. Setting up a morality play in which a monastery attempts to intervene in a local case of youthful sexual indiscretion prove disastrous, the film pivots almost instantly into an abstract self-examination of human contradictions that mingles Middle Path precepts with Marxist dialectics. Not unlike the films of John Cassavetes, “This Transient Life” uses manic theatricality as a means of unpacking subtle emotional complexity, finding grounded and relatable foibles in garish extremes. Throughout, Jissoji puts his camera everywhere except where you’d expect it to be, capturing the drama in de-centered, wide-angled frames that only exacerbate the feeling of the characters being distorted and magnified for study. Rarely has the notion of characters being put under a microscope felt more literally true. —JC Barbet Schroeder’s remarkable documentary was billed as a “self-portrait” for good reason. Uganda’s brutally despotic then-president, Idi Amin, agreed to be filmed on his own terms, confident in how he wanted to be seen. Schroeder let him perform for the camera with minimal intervention, which represented a seismic directorial choice unto itself. “General Idi Amin Dada: A Self-Portrait” doesn’t analyze Amin’s power — it lets us see how power presents itself. What results is both document and spectacle: a record of one man’s delusion, and a warning about how easily image can replace truth. Nearly 50 years later, it still disturbs by showing what happens when control of the camera becomes part of the performance. —TO Akira Kurosawa was so disheartened by the failure of 1970’s Gorky-esque “Dodes’ka-den” that he tried taking his own life. Despite surviving the attempt, Kurosawa was still resigned to the fact that he was unlikely to receive funding ever again. So when the 63-year-old auteur was approached by the Soviet film studio Mosfilm to spend almost two years in the taiga adapting Vladimir Arsenyev’s epic novel “Dersu Uzala” (a book that he had supposedly been fascinated by since the earliest days of his career), Kurosawa wasn’t exactly in a position to say no. The resulting film turned a profit, won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and allowed the “Seven Samurai” director to keep working for another 18 years — a period that saw the creation of the late-career masterpieces “Kagemusha” and “Ran.” But here’s the thing: “Dersu Uzala” is as great as those films — as raw and ravishing as anything Kurosawa ever made. Nature had always played an ambient role in his films, but here, in the story of a czarist expedition to the extremes of Russia’s Far East in the early 20th century, it would become the director’s primary subject. The heart of the story is the growing friendship between the leader of the expedition and a Goldi (or Nanai) hunter named Dersu Uzala who serves as their guide. A number of set pieces stand out, most of all the wildfire that consumes a wheat field, which is given extra dimension by the faded otherworldliness of SovColor — Kurosawa would later pay more explicit tribute to Van Gogh in “Dreams,” but this is the movie of his that most resembles one of the Dutch master’s paintings. A committed leftist his whole life, Kurosawa also found in this story one of cinema’s most profound explorations of colonialism and the impossibility of indigenous people continuing their way of life untrammeled by imperial forces. The animist Goldi believe that nothing can truly be owned, that everything living has a spirit, whereas the Russian forces maintain that everything can quantified and acquired. The tragedy sparked from those two conflicting perspectives is every bit as haunting today as it was 50 years ago. —CB The ‘70s were the decade when cinema was formally established as a field worthy of academic study, and one of the things that was regularly discussed in university film classes was the attempt at finding “a new language for film.” Traditionalist Luchino Visconti was in pursuit of the same with his adaptation of Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” which sees newly widowed Mahler stand-in Gustav von Aschenbach journey to the Lido for “absolute rest.” As Dirk Bogarde’s ailing composer silently takes in the sights on his Italian vacation, Visconti delivers a portrait of subjectivity as potent as “Rear Window,” and with similarly radical sound design. Dialogue seamlessly overlaps with ambient noise as Gustav quietly observes the world against his ever-diminishing place in it, but that languid sense of despair is soon interrupted by the sight of Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), a beautiful Polish teenager who becomes Gustav’s all-consuming obsession. Is Gustav’s fixation predatory, or is it simply that the boy personifies the lost possibilities of the older man’s life? Something to puzzle over. Until that central relationship is established (for his part, Tadzio barely notices the existence of Gustav at all), “Death in Venice” is comfortable to exist in the liminal space between the gorgeousness of its setting and the dread of its protagonist’s anxiety. It’s filmmaking to get lost in, and the ultimate apotheosis of Italian cinema’s inward shift away from Fellini-esque expressionism. Taken in the context of Visconti’s filmography, “Death in Venice” feels like a radical departure from the operatic eruptions of “Rocco and His Brothers.” It’s a film where slight glances, whispered introductions, and the silent offer of an outstretched hand are rich enough to signify the world entire. —CB Made fearlessly just a few years after the 1968 student protests in Mexico City, which resulted in numerous deaths at the hands of the government, Felipe Cazals’ searing indictment of how propaganda can incite a herd mentality — and result in deadly violence — remains as potent as it was when first released. The pioneering filmmaker structured his defiant narrative partially as a fake documentary featuring interviews with actors playing residents of the small rural town of San Miguel Canoa. Their accounts often clash with what we learn happened one night after the malevolent local priest, played with chilling nonchalance by Enrique Lucero, convinces the impoverished residents that a group of young men forced to stay the night in town due to torrential rain are students who’ve arrived to threaten their faith. Without proof of these claims other than the word from the man of the cloth (who operates with ulterior motives), the virulent mob unleash brutality on the visitors — who are in fact university workers, and not pupils. A cautionary tale about the perils of pervasive repression, “Canoa” endures as one of the darkest and most knowing films of its kind. —CA The complaint that they don’t make movies like they used to is as cliched as it is eternal, but watching “The Heartbreak Kid” in 2025 is a quick way to remind yourself how true it really is. The existence of a major studio release centered around a reprehensible man who starts an affair on his honeymoon — and then proceeds to meander through a slow-paced journey in which he learns nothing before the movie fizzles out with a whimper — would be unthinkable in any era except the New Hollywood of the 1970s. And yet, anyone lucky enough to track down a copy of this semi-lost classic can attest that it still holds up as one of the driest, funniest movies of the 20th century. Charles Grodin’s Lenny Cantrow is a man without a single redeeming quality, a smarmy sporting goods salesman who radiates so much selfishness that every institution holding polite society together seemingly dissolves in his presence. To be fair, nobody around him is that great either. His first wife Lila (Jeannie Berlin) is hopelessly naive and needy, falling for Lenny’s tricks for far longer than she should, even if their relationship barely lasts a week. And his second target, Cybill Shepherd’s Kelly Corcoran (because of course, a girl like that would have a name like Kelly Corcoran), is all too happy to let a newlywed man pursue her, seemingly only for the fleeting pleasure of the attention he provides. The only character with any redeeming qualities is her overbearing father who forbids her from dating Lenny. He’s the kind of cheap stock character who normally serves as an antagonist to be defeated in most romances, but the only person thinking clearly in this sick sad world, which should tell you everything you need to know about the morality we’re dealing with here.The all-star pairing of writer Neil Simon and director Elaine May renders the story with an appropriately unsympathetic gaze. Lenny barrels through the world spewing self-serving bullshit as he chases shiny object after shiny object, hurting everyone in his path who falls for it and leaving the few outsiders who see through him to shake their heads in disgust. “The Heartbreak Kid” is often labeled a satire of marriage, but that’s only a half-truth. May and Simon take a neutral stance on the practice itself, but make it clear that some of us are far too narcissistic to deserve it. And the film’s brilliantly abrupt ending illustrates that there’s no other institution that could successfully take its place, because the real problems lie within us, not the cauliflower. —CZ It’s hard to argue that Lau Kar Leung’s “Heroes of the East” is the best of the Shaw Brothers classics that came out of Hong Kong during the 1970s, as the decade’s — and the century’s — quintessential martial-arts studio simply produced too many immortal beat-em-ups for there to be a definitive standout. Nevertheless, this ultra-kinetic relationship comedy about the arranged marriage between a rich Chinese kung fu student (the great Gordon Liu as Ho Tao) and a deceptively meek Japanese woman (Yuka Mizuno as Yumiko) serves as the perfect stand-in for an entire golden age on a list like this one. Not only does “Heroes of the East” highlight a wide, wide variety of the fighting styles that were showcased across the Shaw Brothers’ filmography, and not only does it provide the most dynamic showcase for one of the studio’s greatest stars, but it also epitomizes how fluently these movies bent combat into a hyper-eloquent form of communication unto itself. In this case, that communication expresses a fierce cross-cultural rivalry between Chinese and Japanese styles — comedically at first, and then with growing intensity as a legion of masters from the land of the rising sun travel to Shanghai to prove that Ho Tao is unworthy of Yumiko’s hand. Scored by a symphony of chop! pow! sound effects, each duel is a discrete masterpiece of old school kung-fu choreography, and they build on one another in a way that turns the entire second half of the movie into an extended crescendo of balletic ass-kicking, the grand finale of which is made all the more satisfying by the respect Lau pays to both of the countries involved. —DE Ousmane Sembène’s “Ceddo” offers a vivid and exceptionally complex look at the nascent days of Senegal’s European colonization, but the actual time period covered by the events of the film is never firmly established. “I can’t give a date,” Sembène said when presented the question. “These events occurred in the 18th and 19th century, and are still occurring.” A Wolof-speaking people face a crossroads: Their king wants to ally with the Islamic forces that have been exerting a growing influence on their country, which would later become the modern-day nation of Senegal. The “Ceddo,” outsiders who refuse to be colonized by either Muslims or Christians, kidnap the king’s daughter as ransom to ensure that he turns away from Islam. Violence ensues. Western cinema is prone to stories of privileged male characters being marooned with their enemies, only to find shared values and common cause along the way. With history on its side, “Ceddo” inverts that hero’s journey, as it’s the king’s daughter Dior (Tabata Ndiaye) who finds a new perspective among the outsiders and ultimately fights against her father — a painful but rousing struggle that highlights the eternal war against cultural usurpation, and the crucial role that women must be allowed to play in that fight. —CB A soft but sexually charged drama against the stunning alpine backdrop of Lake Annecy over the course of a summer month, Éric Rohmer’s “Claire’s Knee” initially resembles what a hater of French arthouse cinema probably thinks all of the nation’s films are about. Its story tells of a middle-aged man named Jérôme (Jean-Claude Brialy) whose recent engagement has done nothing to slow his lust for other women. He develops a romantic interest in two underage girls as part of what can only be described an esoteric wager he makes while discussing sex and monogamy with a novelist friend (Aurora Cornu). When he learns that the younger of the two girls is in love with him, he makes a move on her out of recreation as much as anything else, only to be shot down because she doesn’t believe he truly loves her. He then turns his attention to her step-sister, forming an obsession with her knee that consumes his thoughts. But no plot summaries could ever hope to do the film justice, as “Claire’s Knee” has less to do with any individual human relationship than our remarkable ability to rationalize our desires and misdeeds. Jérôme never gets a chance to consummate his lust for Claire — nor, it could be argued, does he really want to. Instead, Rohmer masterfully illustrates the way possession and attainability (or the lack thereof) are inextricably tied to our desires. Every interaction is so profoundly overanalyzed and overcomplicated that it’s a miracle anyone has any fun at all on this miserable trip. The real lesson might be that when there’s a void of activity on a summer vacation, humans will naturally move to fill it. The lewd premise builds to the most chaste of climaxes, with Jérôme talking himself into being content with an utterly mundane (if sinisterly motivated) interaction. Because, despite all of its stunning scenery, “Claire’s Knee” is a film that takes place entirely inside its characters’ minds, with the mental gymnastics they perform to assign meaning to all of their endeavors taking precedence over the endeavors themselves. It’s one of the finest examples of Rohmer’s brand of cinema about destructively intellectual characters, and stands alongside “My Night at Maud’s” as one of his finest “Moral Tales.” —CZ Rainer Werner Fassbinder left behind a body of work that struck a precarious yet remarkably sturdy balance of experimental theater, postwar radicalism, and classical Hollywood melodrama, and “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” is one of the great showcases of his malleability. Reworking the age-gap romantic yearning of Douglas Sirk’s “All That Heaven Allows” around the additional complication of race, Fassbinder brings together lonely, widowed empty-nester Emmi (Brigitte Mira) and hale young Moroccan immigrant Ali (El Hedi ben Salem) as an unlikely couple who rapidly developing affection faces constant tests from disapproving friends, relatives, and sneering passers-by. Fassbinder filters Sirk’s florid, intimate approach to melodrama through his own eerily pristine, at times ironically detached style. He frequently lenses in long shots that convey not the emotions between the couple but the icy, judgmental stares of others who watch them with revulsion. The film also highlights the way in which even the most obviously disapproving people will still put on a facade of cordiality that only makes their disdain sharper. There are also reminders of Germany’s grim recent history, as when Emmi takes Ali to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their elopement and reflexively boasts “Hitler used to eat here!” As both she and Ali feel the pressure from their loved ones to end their relationship, the emotions held at arm’s length eventually explode, leading to perhaps the most visceral ending of Fassbinder’s vast canon. —JC An obstinate seeker who hadn’t been able to finish any of the films he’d started, Errol Morris was on the verge of turning 30 when he stumbled upon a San Francisco Chronicle headline that read: “450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY.” Armed with new resolve, he gathered money from friends and family to closely investigate the story in the spring and summer of 1977. His friend, Werner Herzog, famously pledged to eat a shoe if the film was ever finished and exhibited. Though it technically explores pet cemeteries, “Gates of Heaven” isn’t much considered with its ostensible raison d’être. Morris uses pets, death, and small businesses as a lens to consider people’s voices: the manner in which they speak, the narratives they construct about themselves, the yarns they spin. The young director bent cinema vérité to his will by eschewing the de rigueur handheld style of the era in favor of a static camera and direct address. Morris’s locked-off medium shots not only called attention to his highly composed framing, but they also had the hypnotic effect of drawing audiences closer to his subjects as they wax (or drawl) poetic (or comical) about everything under the sun. When Morris screened “Gates of Heaven” for his idol Douglas Sirk at the Berlin Film Festival, he walked out halfway through, calling the film a slideshow. It’s easy to see how he arrived at such a conclusion, and, possibly heeding the filmmaker’s criticism, Morris would never deploy such stillness again in his career. But only the most stubbornly dogmatic viewer could ignore the cinematic spirit animating the director’s photographic compositions. Sirk also cautioned Morris about his film’s supposedly ironic pose, a humorous note considering how frequently the master of melodrama utilized irony in his own work. While Morris certainly mines comedy from his subjects’s eccentricities or quirks of speech, anyone who believes that he made “Gates of Heaven” as an exercise in mockery simply isn’t paying attention. Morris’s permissive interviewing strategy, which entails getting his subjects to speak for as long as possible without much intervention, doesn’t merely facilitate open communication. It’s also a sign of unencumbered respect for their worldviews. Take, for example, Florence Rasmussen, an elderly woman who lives across the street from one of the two pet cemeteries the film examines. She delivers an uninterrupted five-minute monologue about her life while sitting in her front doorway. Circuitous and contradictory, and gloriously “off topic,” her speech exemplifies Morris’s attentive approach: if you just let people talk, they’ll reveal the world. —VM A father has raised his children without contact with the outside world, and their lifelong isolation has warped their understanding of social norms. Yet the older they get, the more they question what’s beyond the walls that ostensibly cage them for their protection. The description may call to mind Yorgos Lanthimos’ Oscar-nominated “Dogtooth,” but it refers instead to “The Castle of Purity,” the breakthrough film by unsung Mexican master Arturo Ripstein. Inspired by a shocking case that came to light in 1950s Mexico City, the unflinching drama chronicles how Gabriel (Claudio Brook), a disturbed patriarch, walks the streets finding buyers for the rat poison that his wife and kids produce in their large home. He rules with the firm hand of an authoritarian at home, and though he forbids his family from eating meat or indulging in worldly vices, he doesn’t preach by example. Ripstein, who immediately recognized the inspiration that “Dogtooth” took from his film, is an artist recurrently interested in religious hypocrisy and the most sordid alcoves of the human mind; here, he depicts the abuse Gabriel inflicts on his household with sobering rigor, resolving in an unforgettable study of how evil has always found domesticity to be among its most convincing disguises. —CA A 15-year-old moppet named Mike (John Moulder-Brown) drops out of school and lands a gig at an East London public bath at the tail end of the swingin’ ’60s, where he’s preyed upon by the sexually underserved female clientele at the same time as he begins obsessing over his seasoned and inscrutable co-worker Susan (Jane Asher, fresh off a relationship with Paul McCartney). It’s Mike’s first job, and he doesn’t know that they’re not all like this. Plunged into a seedy but spectacular world that’s brimming with desire and steeped in confusion, Mike is soon at the mercy of his own lust for life — a lust that fixates upon Susan, and rages at all the reasons why she can’t belong to him. One of the only color movies that David Lynch ever loved, Jerzy Skolomowski’s darkly fun “Deep End” is as hyper-vivid in its production design as it is in its hormonal distress. Here is a film that sees coming of age as a delirium thick enough to drown in, as its naive protagonist — a virginal need monster who sees older men take what they want from the young women around them, and is too horny to recognize that they’re stealing — tries his best to stay afloat in the turbulent waters between free love and possessive ownership. Skolomowski’s almost psychedelic approach to psychosexual mania creates an unbroken dreamstate where nothing feels real but everything is. Where the world begs to be touched even as it remains just out of reach. Where Susan is both an inanimate crush object and a richly humanized character who’s already had to pay too high a price for her sexual currency (a dynamic that’s indelibly realized in the sequence where Mike steals a life-sized nude cut-out of a woman who looks just like Susan, and proceeds to project all of his desire onto it over the course of a long dark night). All the more true to life for its expressionistic flourishes, and for an ending that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a fable, “Deep End” announced the full possibilities of ’70s cinema with a fatal bang. —DE Widely acknowledged as the first home-grown Jamaican film to be shot with an entirely Jamaican cast and crew, Perry Henzell’s “The Harder They Come” is a shaggy-dog thriller that also happens to be a form-breaking smash (as radical as “Breathless” in its own right), and “the film that brought reggae to the world.” That’s the thing: Maybe you’ve never watched “The Harder They Come,” but you’ve absolutely heard multiple songs from its smash-hit soundtrack album. Many of them are by the film’s star Jimmy Cliff, but the tunes also include all-time bangers like “Draw Your Brakes” by Scotty and “Sweet and Dandy” and “Pressure Drop” by Toots & the Maytals. Take a look at the movie, though: Cliff stars as a wayward youth, Ivanhoe “Ivan” Martin, who grew up in the countryside but tries to make it big in the Kingston recording industry. Crossing paths with gangsters and a shady record mogul who only wants to pay him a one-and-done $20 for recording the title track, Ivan becomes a trigger-happy outlaw unwilling to play by society’s rules. It starts naturalistically enough, so much so that if you just flipped to it on TV you might think it’s a documentary at first. By the end, however, Henzell’s film actually plays more like late ‘60s Godard than “Breathless,” with scenes of militarized police pursuing Ivan on gorgeous beaches while meta touches — including the interspersed use of Sergio Corbucci’s “Django” — break down why we’re all so besotted by outlaw mystique in the first place. Even if the music gets more of the attention, the film itself is every bit as intoxicating. If there’s the cinematic equivalent of an ear-worm, this is it. —CB Long before indie cinema as we know it found its footing in the ’90s, Claudia Weill’s “Girlfriends” delivered a groundbreaking look at female friendship, ambition, and loneliness — all through the lens of one woman’s coming-of-age in New York City. Shot on a shoestring budget (and one that almost didn’t cut it), but with razor-sharp emotional clarity, “Girlfriends” is a landmark of American independent filmmaking and one of the most criminally overlooked gems of the 1970s. Well, overlooked no more. At a time when studio films rarely centered the interior lives of women, “Girlfriends” dared to tell a story about the complexities of female independence. Melanie Mayron stars as Susan, a struggling photographer navigating career uncertainty and emotional isolation after her best friend (played by Anita Skinner) abruptly gets married and moves out. What follows is a radical exploration of solitude, creative frustration, and the shifting dynamics of female friendship. Think of it this way, can you name another film that both Stanley Kubrick and Greta Gerwig have praised? Weill’s direction captures small moments with a documentary-like intimacy that feels years ahead of its time. There’s no melodrama here — just the authentic messiness of life in your twenties, portrayed with empathy and humor. It’s a film that doesn’t just pass the Bechdel Test — it practically wrote it. In an era dominated by antiheroes and epics, “Girlfriends” carved out something smaller, more personal — and in doing so, became one of the most enduring and influential films of the decade. —KE Hayao Miyazaki is most famous for making personal, original, idiosyncratic films about his favored themes: nature, environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, youth, and aging. But for his feature debut, when Ghibli was just a glimmer in his eye, he made pure franchise popcorn entertainment. And the result is a complete blast. “The Castle of Cagliostro” is a stand-alone entry in the “Lupin III” series, an iconic manga and anime franchise about the descendant of legendary gentleman thief Arsene Lupin, as he travels the world with his criminal gang taking on heists and outfoxing the determined Interpol agent Zenigata. In “Castle of Cagliostro,” his heist isn’t to steal money or gold, but a person: Princess Clarisse, who is being forced to marry the titular Cagliostro, a monstrous greedy count. It’s a perfect setup for some fun, and “Castle of Cagliostro” is fun above all else, a total action-adventure blast with setpieces like the car chase and the often-imitated clock-tower fight that rank among the most thrilling moments in the anime film canon. Miyazaki’s confidence and skill as director from the jump is a sight to behold. —WC “The Devils” is a blasphemous film, although the hysterical profanity and nuns lasciviously tonguing Christ’s side wound aren’t what’s truly heretical about it. Instead, director Ken Russell’s most vicious critiques of the Catholic Church appear in the small moments of spiritual repose playboy priest Father Grandier (Oliver Reed) finds with a woman he meets through the church. The Holy See’s perverse lust for power means that it would rather torture and kill innocent people than allow them to find God through each other. That’s what Russell’s condemning here. The rest is all set dressing — set dressing provocative enough that Warner Bros. has done its best to suppress the film for the past 50 years, but still. —KR What is left to say about a film like “Klute?” Alan J. Pakula’s call girl noir has had, at one point or another, every element of its craft rightly celebrated by critics in the 54 years since its initial release. The textures of the film — the score, the outfits, the light fixtures and how Gordon Willis painted with them — prove the aesthetic zenith of a bygone era in American cinema. In a genre where individuals are often merely synecdoche for institutional machinations, the romance between Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland is disarmingly grounded. Fonda’s Bree Daniel is an idol of feminist cinema, and the film’s radically non-judgmental view of sex work remains admirable. In a world so obsessed with the contradiction of cinematic voyeurism and the symbolic martyrdom of rough women, Pakula pursues different questions with better answers. “Klute” examines the sensuality of autonomy, the messiness of adult intimacy, and whether acting in direct defiance of harms suffered can ever offer real solace, or instead further trap someone within their trauma. All of this is well-worn territory, but none of that matters when you sit down to watch the movie — even now, more than 50 years since “Klute” was first released, its allure proves totally singular. —SB Meiko Kaji was already bored with playing stoic badasses by the time she was approached for the title role in Toshiya Fujita’s adaptation of Kazuo Koike’s manga series. But she liked the director and the script, so she took the job. And thank goodness she did, because Kaji’s Yuki, an assassin trained from birth to avenge her family’s deaths, is one of the most iconic action heroines in all of cinema. Her graceful movements and intense stare are practically supernatural, an effect that’s enhanced by the striking production design and stylized carnage. You might think you’ve seen the color red, but you really haven’t — not until you’ve seen “Lady Snowblood.” —KR “Why would you choose someone who loves you too little over someone who loves you too much?” Charles (John Heard) asks his lover Laura (Mary Beth Hurt) as they’re tearfully breaking up. “Because it makes me feel less of a fraud,” she curtly responds. A toxically-romantic comedy adapted from Ann Beattie’s 1976 novel, Joan Micklin Silver’s “Chilly Scenes of Winter” chronicles a doomed affair between two aimless thirtysomethings in snowy Salt Lake City. Charles pines for Laura in between wasting away at his bullshit government job and dealing with his mentally unstable mother (Gloria Grahame), but he does so to such an narcissistic, self-destructive degree that his behavior would raise significant red flags in our current social climate. Part of the greatness of “Chilly Scenes of Winter” lies in Silver’s abject refusal to condemn Charles’s obsession with Laura; instead, she empathizes with his passion, even when he’s being pointedly unlikable or downright cruel. Heard’s holistic performance treats the romantic and spiteful streaks in Charles’s character as if they emanate from the same confused source rather than two sides of a split personality. His love is as genuine as Laura’s ambivalence, which extends in just about every direction —towards Charles and her failing marriage to her dull husband, but mostly towards herself. Silver’s sincere respect for the sheer realism of her characters—their messy personalities, the fundamentally tenebrous nature of their relationship, their asymmetrical love for each other—has no parallel in the domestic drama. Yet, it’s Silver’s choice to situate Charles and Laura’s mutual anguish within, as opposed to outside, life’s myriad headaches that elevates their relationship to unexpected cinematic heights. Overfamiliar bosses and lovesick secretaries, familial burdens and friendly obligations, the humdrum routine of going to work and feeding oneself in winter intrude upon Charles’s heartache. Neither his lovelorn desires nor Laura’s guilt can take priority over everything else in their respective worlds because there’s simply too many unsexy adult responsibilities to manage, until eventually the yearning becomes another chore. Silver acutely understands that casual tragedy of Charles and Laura broken relationship is that life didn’t stop for them. It just goes on and on until the pain becomes a distant memory. —VM In her dismissive review of “Seven Beauties,” Pauline Kael wrote that Lina Wertmüller “keeps her films moving by hurling salamis at the audience.” And maybe that’s true — after all, this withering dark comedy includes the most jarring close-up of a penis in the history of Holocaust cinema — but not in the way that Kael meant it. By 1975, the movies were already starving for new ways to visualize the greatest atrocity of the 20th century, which three decades of post-war cinema had already ossified into a dead language of digestible images. Wertmüller had to feed the people something. In that sense, her magnum opus is one hell of a meal. A larger-than-life Giancarlo Giannini stars as Pasqualino “Seven Beauties” Frafuso, Naples’ horniest and most flamboyant hoodlum, and a man whose utter lack of dignity is ultimately his only hope of enduring the depravity of a concentration camp. Combining the picaresque lightness of an old fable with the unfathomable horrors of real life — and using the subversive pleasures of grindhouse cinema to reinvigorate a nightmare the world is always on the brink of forgetting — Wertmüller’s greatest and most grotesque film had the temerity to think of survival as a virtue unto itself. In committing to that idea until the bitter end, “Seven Beauties” was able to prevent the Holocaust from becoming just another genre. Almost 50 years later, it still retains that same power. —DE A philosophical take on the vampire myth, Bill Gunn’s 1973 arthouse horror film features erudite characters, heady eroticism, and complex commentary on African-American ethnic and religious identity, all rendered in 16mm that shimmers in the summer heat. “Night of the Living Dead” actor Duane Jones stars, playing an anthropologist whose research into an obscure cult of African blood-drinkers gains a new dimension after his assistant (Gunn) stabs him with an ancient ceremonial dagger. It’s a startling work of art, one that was nearly lost after bad reviews led its distributor to recut it as an exploitation picture. Gunn’s version was eventually restored, and was remade by Spike Lee as “Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” in 2014. —KR Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Stalker” looks and moves unlike anything that came before it. To create one of the most immersive sci-fi worlds ever captured on celluloid, Tarkovsky relied on the neat trick of telling audiences absolutely nothing. We never learn when the film takes place or what country its characters hail from, only that there’s a dangerous place called the Zone where you can come face to face with your truest desires. It’s a harrowing journey to your final destination, which requires those brave enough to visit the Zone to hire tour guides known as “Stalkers.” That’s all we get before the Russian auteur launches us on an unforgettable journey through the contradictions of the human psyche. And it’s a good thing thing he keeps us in the dark so much, because anything else would be overkill.Tarkovsky fills the Zone with a combination of lush greenery and abandoned machinery, creating an undeniable image of humans fighting a losing battle with nature. Everything, from the tour guide’s warnings to the harsh landscape, suggests that mankind doesn’t belong here. That there are some truths lurking in the universe that we simply weren’t meant to know. It all builds to a climax that’s painful to wrap one’s mind around even after multiple viewings: Our truest desires are lurking so deep within us that there’s no guarantee that we know them ourselves. Tarkovsky was hardly the first to suggest that we’re imprisoned by our cravings and urges, but he crystallized their sinister and uncontrollable nature better than any filmmaker before or since. —CZ Martin Scorsese’s fourth feature showcased the director’s love for cinema — and for the actresses who built it — in its first frames. Shot by Marty’s pal Michael Ballhaus, this luminous 1974 drama kicks off with a nearly shot-for-shot homage to Victor Fleming’s “The Wizard of Oz” before opening up onto the world of Alice, played by Ellen Burstyn. Her delivery-driver husband, with whom she and her small son lived in a middle-of-nowhere New Mexico town, is killed on the job, and so they jettison to California in hopes of cobbling together a better life. Burstyn and Alfred Lutter, who plays Alice’ son Tommy, have an easy chemistry; he’s a child who’s been around only adults his whole life and can’t relate to people his own age, forced to fathom the dramas and dealings of those older than him. Alice and Tommy wind up in Arizona, where she takes up a job at a folksy diner in hopes of scrounging up enough change to get all the way to California. Their time in Phoenix surrounds a lovely, leisurely plot where Alice gets into yet another bad relationship. Fabulous minor roles are played by the likes of Diane Ladd as another waitress at the cafe, who has an angry and witty tongue, and Jodie Foster as a tomboy Tommy later meets in Tucson. This and “Mommy Dearest” were the only films screenwriter Robert Getchell was really known for. The gentle lilt and warmth of this kitchen-sink drama — really the last from Scorsese — make for a refreshing entree into the filmmaker’s meaner and more viscerally pungent later work. It’s the rare portrait of an intelligent and funny woman who stands on her own, even as she’s wobbling, in the director’s mostly male-driven filmography. For all the grief he’s gotten because of that slant, “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” remains one of the very best things he’s ever made. —RL No one could extract deep meaning from static landscapes like Chantal Akerman, and the “Jeanne Dielman” filmmaker’s juxtaposition of avant-garde structure and raw emotion was never more potent than in “News From Home.” In 1976, Akerman returned to New York City, where she lived for two years while finding her footing as an artist. There, she observed once-familiar settings made distant not only by time, but by the dispassionate lens of her camera. The resulting footage is overlaid with narration reading letters from Akerman’s mother, which are affectionate and chatty but with an undertone of sadness. Combined, they evoke a precise, poignant emotion, the lonely but thrilling sensation of standing on a train platform far from home. —KR It’s bold to make a thriller where the action is predicated on not moving around too much, and even bolder to remake the rare thriller that manages to pull that off (Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “The Wages of Fear”). But in the humid-as-hell “Sorcerer,” William Friedkin’s direction turns the tiniest shifts into the stuff of breathtaking suspense, as two trucks — doubled up to ensure that at least one of them makes the drop-off — packed with highly unstable payloads of nitroglycerin slowly crawl their way through the muddy South American jungle. The roads that lead to these moments are almost as compelling, as Friedkin skillfully introduces the movie’s four criminal protagonists and their reasons for taking this suicidal job. Cynical, sweaty, and set to one of the most transportive film scores ever composed, “Sorcerer” is New Hollywood filmmaking at its finest — even if it took a few decades for Hollywood to realize it. —KR As sublime a full-color epic as has ever been projected onto a movie screen, King Hu’s “A Touch of Zen” was key in introducing the aesthetics and values of Chinese wuxia storytelling to the West. A former Shaw Brothers studio man with an artistic eye and an exacting sense of detail, Hu brought a spiritual dimension to his tales of chivalrous combat that elevated them above their contemporaries. Here, the martial-arts action is secondary: The first real fight scene doesn’t take place until nearly an hour into the picture. But when those scenes do come, they’re nothing short of spectacular — balletic and graceful and edited with an eccentric rhythm that only enhances the magic of skilled performers in motion. —KR Made over an arduous 15 years in which star Meena Kumari’s alcoholism not only regularly derailed filming but ended her marriage to director Kamal Amrohi, “Pakeezah” at last emerged in 1972 as a typically baroque Bollywood melodrama that traces a forbidden romance between a courtesan and her highborn lover down to the next generation of their respective families. Through various twists of fate, the daughter that a wealthy man could not recognize eventually catches the eye of his nephew, repeating a cycle of heartbreak. What separates the film from its peers is the sheer depth of Amrohi’s direction, which often makes up for Kumari’s inconsistent dancing in musical sequences with a heavy use of other performers arrayed in dizzying multi-planar compositions that cross the elaborate blocking of Jacques Tati’s “Playtime” with the most ambitious Indian dance choreography. Rendered in luminous color, “Pakeezah” is like an ornate music box, suspended outside of rationality or even time while conveying an instantly felt emotional directness. —JC Frederick Wiseman’s arc is one of the most important in the history of American documentary film: from a deep skeptic of U.S. institutions, to a fierce defender of them. “Welfare” is one of his greatest achievements because it occupies a kind of middle ground — and points to exactly where America would be headed over the next 50 years. Set in a New York City welfare office, Wiseman’s film paints a portrait of American social assistance as existing in a kind of perpetual defensive posture. It consists almost entirely of deeply suspicious interviews between the welfare office workers and the struggling people they’re ostensibly there to help, as the workers almost never seem to trust the people who’ve come in search of the assistance they need to survive. Each applicant who’s there to talk about a check that got lost in the mail or some other changed circumstance is kept at arm’s length with a verbal 10-foot pole, and subjected to a litany of questions that assume ill intent or ignorance of the office’s practices so profound that they don’t “deserve” help. This is 1975, just 10 years after the establishment of Great Society programs, but the Nixon-Ford push toward defunding these institutions is already underway. You can’t get rid of welfare and Medicaid altogether? Just make certain they’re so underfunded and understaffed they become hollowed out husks, their employees so overworked and undertrained that the people they are meant to help come to hate the very idea of government and are teed up to vote to dismantle it even further in the decades to come. Wiseman’s fly-on-the-wall approach relies upon luck and patience, and he captures lightning in a bottle with a particularly poetic welfare applicant who ends his film with a prophetic summation — not only of his situation, but also of what it says about where America was headed. He suggests that if this country does so little to help its own people — and make no mistake, this is a portrait of welfare as a system of loss and risk mitigation (with policing as a Band-Aid for everything) rather than one actually trying to help people and, you know, encourage a healthier, more productive, less aggrieved society — America would cease to exist by 1988. It’s taken a bit longer than that, but his prediction is clearly in the process of coming true. “Welfare” isn’t only a lucid portrait of the past, it’s also Wiseman’s most prescient vision of the future. —CB Not only the greatest journalism movie ever made, “All the President’s Men” is in some ways the ‘70s movie par excellence, with its combination of an absolute naturalism in its acting and writing — courtesy of an extraordinary script by William Goldman — and a subtle expressionism in the cinematography by Gordon Willis. Goldman made an extraordinary choice: To only adapt the first half of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward’s book, ending the film with Nixon’s second inauguration in January 1973. It takes some of the melodrama out of the story of Watergate, and puts the focus squarely on the journalistic process. One thing is certain: “All the President’s Men” features the greatest “phone acting” of all time, with extremely lengthy scenes of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford’s Bernstein and Woodward speaking with source after source to assemble a journalistic puzzle for the ages. In Goldman’s hands, this is dialogue that’s purely procedural, full of pauses and filler words and dead ends (only a little of Bernstein and his girlfriend Nora Ephron’s script rewrite that established Bernstein as “catnip to the ladies,” according to Goldman, made it in), and brought to understated but never less than thrilling dramatic life by director Alan J. Pakula, with Redford overseeing the entire production through his Wildwood Enterprises company. As he had achieved in his previous films of his “Paranoia Trilogy” (“Klute” and “The Parallax View”), Pakula creates a pervasive mood of fear — a fear that had threatened to become the animating force in American life. If anything, it turns out that we weren’t being paranoid enough. —CB Sometimes the smallest conflicts demand the largest canvases. Cinematographer Gordon Willis photographs New York City in black-and-white Panavision widescreen for “Manhattan,” infusing the on-screen metropolis with timeless romantic grandeur. The city’s ineffable beauty lies in tension with the neuroses of Isaac Davis (director and co-writer Woody Allen), a twice-divorced middle-aged comedy writer juggling a relationship with seventeen-year-old high school student Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) and his growing attraction to cerebral journalist Mary (Diane Keaton), who’s having an affair with Isaac’s married best friend Yale (Michael Murphy). While Allen invests himself in the autogenous problems of the cultured class, he often throws them in sharp relief by situating them within the splendor of their urban environment. Manhattan streets become a playground for intellectual gamesmanship and emotional bonding. A conversation about past lovers and contemporary trysts takes place against the transcendental darkness of the Hayden Planetarium. Gramercy Park whizzes by in the background as a desperate man runs to save a doomed romance. They consume the city, but can’t lose themselves in it. Willis’s visual beauty neither elevates nor obscures the self-involved headaches of Allen’s characters. Instead, it envelops them, imbuing them with a cinematic gloss while keeping them firmly relegated to the mortal realm. The quotidian, narcissistic concerns at the heart of “Manhattan”—trying to find love and meaning at all personal costs, forgoing integrity for immediate pleasure, deferring mortality by throwing oneself into art — still comprise the primordial goo of human experience. “You have to have a little faith in people,” Tracy tells Isaac at the end of the film, after he uses her, mostly to torture himself, and then blithely tosses her aside for a shot at Mary, only to regret it the second he’s alone again. The famous line — delivered impeccably by Hemingway, who gives a remarkably unaffected performance that still feels miraculous — prompts a silent, powerfully uncertain reaction from Allen that can be read a million different ways. The cathartic Gershwin score underscores the irony of the moment’s superficially straightforward catharsis: Allen’s film argues people are predictable and disappointing, and that the only faith to be found in them is the consistency of their corruption. What’s left is art, which, of course, is made by people. If life is only worth living because of art, and art exists because of (or maybe in spite of) people, and people are inherently corrupt, then is life worth living? The “unsolvable, terrifying problems of the universe” endure unabated. —VM At his core, Bobby Dupea is a searcher. Restless and irresolute, he’s determined to find purpose in a world that baffles him and amongst people who bore him. Born into an upper-class family of musical prodigies, Bobby rejects the comforts of his upbringing and his considerable artistic talents in favor of a hardscrabble blue-collar life. But it’s clear he doesn’t work on an oil rig or date a waitress with country western aspirations for the progressive optics, or even to alienate his family. His drive for adventure, to negate all semblance of former identity, comes from a sincere, obscure place buried deep in his heart. By 1970, this archetype — the privileged societal drop-out who leaves home to, per Simon and Garfunkel, “look for America” — had amassed some clichés in a post-Summer of Love culture. In the hands of most actors, Bobby Dupea would resemble a collection of affectations instead of a whole human being. But Jack Nicholson is not “most actors,” and thus he imbues the protagonist of Bon Rafelson’s “Five Easy Pieces” with the disordered interiority of a character from literature. He conveys his confused anger and deep-seated sorrow with casual grace, whether he’s trying to contain his uncouth, terminally sweet girlfriend Rayette (a remarkable Karen Black), or manage his barely-concealed contempt around his blue-blooded family, whom he reluctantly agrees to visit in the Pacific Northwest after hearing about his patriarch’s poor health. It’s only the presence of the earnest, grounded Catherine (Susan Anspach), a piano student studying at his family home who’s attracted to Bobby but can’t stomach his apathy, that challenges his hard exterior. The film is defined by an existential melancholy, accented by László Kovács’s painterly photography and conveyed through Nicholson’s performance. In its most famous scene, Bobby patiently confronts a stubborn diner waitress whose strict adherence to the establishment’s “no substitutions” policy has made it impossible for him to order a side of toast. (“You want to hold the chicken salad?” the waitress sneers. “I want you to hold it between your knees,” Bobby famously responds.) Though funny and righteous, the scene’s anti-establishment fervor is tinged with despair. However clever he may be, Bobby just can’t adapt to the customs of a diner, let alone his family or America. He doesn’t get his toast, he doesn’t land the girl he wants or already has, and he doesn’t find purpose. But as the ending indicates, nothing will stop him from trying. —VM Almost certainly the greatest student film ever made, “Eraserhead” was made by a young David Lynch with a budget of $100,000, a series of soundstages and sets owned by the American Film Institute, and a wife and child he was caring for at home. From those humble beginnings, Lynch created something immortal — a stark and enigmatic hallucination that feels untethered to any specific time or place, but continues to endure as a result of its hyper-potent elusiveness. Inspired by his experiences of fatherhood, and his time living with his young family in the Fairmont neighborhood of Philadelphia, Lynch transports “Eraserhead” viewers to an industrial landscape that feels devoid of light and hope, where the hapless hero (Jack Nance, with an iconic shock of frazzled hair) struggles to care for the strange monster his girlfriend gave birth to. With evocative black-and-white photography Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, along with unnerving sound design from Lynch himself that disorients at every turn, “Eraserhead” is a work of remarkable craft far beyond its modest origins — and a heartbreaking portrait of parental anxiety that will find purchase with a new generation of viewers for as long as movies can still find their cults. —WC Barbara Kopple’s landmark documentary opens with shots of Kentucky coal miners lying flat on a conveyer belt as they slide down the depths of the Brookside Mine, literalizing the pernicious capitalistic notion of human beings as tools. She spends the remainder of the film illustrating the dignity and resolve of those same miners as they strike against the Eastover Coal Company for refusing to honor their union contract with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Kopple’s righteous on-the-ground filmmaking goes within people’s homes and behind picket lines to capture the miners’ effectively confrontational tactics and the unsustainable conditions that made the strike inevitable, including Eastover’s indifference to basic safety standards, which lead to prevalent cases of black lung amongst the laborers, and the Duke Power Company’s record profit increases while worker wages stagnate compared to the cost of living. As “Harlan County, USA” makes clear, Brookside miners were never going to quietly die in squalor without a fight. Kopple leverages the best of vérité techniques to immerse audiences into Harlan County’s social and economic milieu while refusing to strictly adhere to direct cinema orthodoxy. She seamlessly incorporates archival footage, fly-on-the-wall observational footage of union meetings, direct interviews with miners and their wives, and spare use of expositional intertitles to situate viewers in the present-tense moment. Though her primary motivation was to document the struggle, Kopple rarely sacrifices aesthetics in pursuit of that goal. Close-ups of hardened miner faces often speak louder than their words. Transitional montages of poverty-line life soundtracked by folk music illuminate the necessity of labor conflicts in America. A magnificent single take depicts the strikers, who have blocked off a public road leading to the mines, demand the local sheriff deliver an arrest warrant to head gun thug Basil Collins, who sits in a line of cars waiting to threaten the picketers. “Harlan County, USA” typifies the emotional power of worker solidarity exhibited in union meetings and funerals, in demonstrations outside the Duke Power’s North Carolina and on Wall Street. Yet, Kopple is careful not to tip into convenient utopian thinking. As much as the film was created in part to generate a manual for labor organizers, she depicts how hard-fought gains can be just as easily nullified by a divided workforce or ineffectual union leadership. Rhyming with the opening scenes, “Harlan County, USA” closing sequence features miners leaving Brookside mine after another day of drudgery. Kopple’s point is potently unsubtle: as long as people need to work to live, and as long management believes in profits over people, the fight will continue. —VM Unsparing and uncompromising, Martha Coolidge’s debut feature documents its own creation while also re-staging the director’s adolescent rape. Coolidge’s metafictional approach provides the director and her actors — Michele Manenti, who plays Coolidge as a teenager and is herself a sexual assault victim, and Jim Carrington, who plays Coolidge’s attacker — the venue to process trauma without mitigating its horrors. The narrative scenes of a young Martha going on a date from hell and then having to face the judgment of her boarding school dorm-mates never once play like a chintzy after-school special, even as the audience remains constantly aware of their artificial nature. Meanwhile, the fourth-wall-breaking sequences, when Coolidge discusses rape culture and gendered approaches to sexuality with her actors, both of whom bravely commit to the project while also being rattled by the material, startle in their emotional honesty and notable lack of judgment. In the interim 50 years, Americans have become slightly — slightly — more conscious of the prevalence of sexual assault, the importance of consent, and the insidiousness of victim blaming. Yet, “Not a Pretty Picture” never once feels dated in its insights or approach. On the contrary, it feels sadly contemporary. By embracing the constructed unreality of her real-life memory while simultaneously witnessing actors dedicate themselves to its authenticity, Coolidge generates a quietly cathartic experience. “Not a Pretty Picture” never functions like an educational text (though Carrington admits the film could serve that purpose), and Coolidge doesn’t pretend to be in the business of imparting lessons on her actors or her audience. Still, it’s clear that everyone involved comes away affected by the project. Coolidge situates her cast and crew and the audience inside and outside her life-altering experience in order for them to viscerally feel her pain while also intellectually consider it. One of the great debut features of the decade, “Not a Pretty Picture” acutely understands that cinema offers an illusory space, one whose inherently manufactured nature allows memories to be projected and ensnared where they can be experienced without being relived. —VM At a retrospective screening last December, Elaine May clarified that while her downbeat buddy comedy “Mikey and Nicky” does have laughs, they’re “just not the cheery kind.” Inspired by May’s observations of low-level gangsters in Chicago, the film explores male friendship at its most abject, as two lifelong pals — one a maudlin drunk played by John Cassavetes, the other a practical family man embodied by Peter Falk — embark upon an ostensibly freewheeling nighttime journey towards a sobering and inevitable dawn. Misunderstood, like much of May’s work, upon its initial release, “Mikey and Nicky” has seen found its rightful purchase as a classic thanks to May’s incisive screenwriting and the believably desperate performances of her stars. —KR Among everything else you could say about George Lucas’s cinematic cosmic cocktail: Is this simply the most talked about movie of all time? If so, that makes finding something new to offer on the subject a major challenge. And yet, the richness of this work is such that there always seems to be another angle to explore. Like how a camera had never tilted and panned through a starfield before “Star Wars.” Or how the “Mos Eisley Cantina” theme is basically just Dixieland jazz with a little bit of the Charleston added in for good measure. Or the extraordinary narrative choice to just plunge viewers into the middle of the action and leave it to viewers to get their own bearings — there’s never an explanation of what a Jawa is or why they’ve suddenly kidnapped our droid heroes, they just are. You figure it out. That’s Lucas’s soft-spoken invitation to us to explore this galaxy on our own and find our own way around — and millions upon millions formed their own personal connection with “Star Wars” as a result. When you find your own way to something, it’s always a more powerful bond than when it’s imposed on you. Critics always like to point out the way that “Star Wars” stands on the shoulders of Old Hollywood adventure serials like “Flash Gordon,” but as much as Lucas excavated the past, he reinterpreted it too, through his generational post-Vietnam lens. Tunisia doesn’t just replace, say, Monument Valley for a desert landscape, Lucas also has it that the Empire massacres a group of indigenous people early in the film and clumsily tries to hide their murders by pinning it on another indigenous group. Then has the Empire destroy an entire planet, basically just because it can. For as much as it’s a standalone film, “Star Wars” is also a rewarding companion piece to “American Graffiti.” That film is all about a teenager questioning whether he really wants to leave home, about “refusing the call” in Joseph Campbell terms. “Star Wars” is all about what happens after, when you’ve actually left. How you have to find out who you are and what you’re made of, and put together a new family you find along the way. We may not have to take on a Death Star first thing, but the leap that we all have to take in growing up has rarely found a more universal expression than it does in “Star Wars.” —CB Humble Italian peasants living at the end of the 19th century serve as the collective protagonist of Ermanno Olmi’s gorgeously orchestrated, Palme d’Or-winning pastoral saga. Men, women, and children toll away day in and day out on fields that don’t belong to them — all to enrich the wealthy landowner while they struggle to survive on what little they are allowed to keep. Under these precarious circumstances, where every pair of hands is put to use doing manual labor, sending a child to school is a luxury few can afford. One couple decides to spring for it anyway, as the local priest has encourage them to nourish their boy’s God-given intelligence in the hopes that their sacrifice may pay off down the road. But that’s only one story in this boisterous farmhouse of tales. We also a widow trying to support her six children by washing other people’s clothes, and several young people who seek love in a reality where the death of a farm animal — or even something as small as a broken shoe — can test a family’s resilience. And as calamity befalls them, their only solace is the belief that somehow the grace of God will pull them from their desperation. The brilliance of Olmi’s ensemble piece lies in how organically, and unhurriedly, it weaves in and out of each family’s vicissitudes, while also offering glimpses into the unrest that’s brewing beyond the confines of this community. —CA From the poorly designed stunts that brutalized Ellen Burstyn and 14-year-old Linda Blair, to filmmaker William Friedkin’s infamous use of the so-called “practical scare” on set (he reportedly fired real guns at will to keep his actors alert), “The Exorcist” is a cinematic masterpiece — and horrifying in more ways than one. I haven’t even gotten into that mysterious studio fire, yet! The unnerving and electric possession of Regan MacNeil was adapted by screenwriter William Peter Blatty from his 1971 novel. The story, particularly its Georgetown setting, was inspired by a real case of attempted exorcism documented by the Catholic Church in 1948, but Blatty and Friedkin’s influence hung over the 1970s in the shadows of “The Exorcist” and its varied successors. Between works like Richard Donner’s monumental “The Omen” (1976), and John Boorman’s divisive, locus-infested “Exorcist II: The Heretic” (1977), not every cinematic follow-up to “The Exorcist” feels worthy of its association with the Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay. (It also took home Best Sound.) But you could argue the same thing about the countless generically named “Creepy Girl” props you’ll find resembling Blair in haunted decoration stands every Halloween… and who doesn’t love those? Worth making the predictable word choice to call it “head-spinning” at least once, “The Exorcist” begins slow — stewing in the sands of an archaeological dig that unleashes a terror from the pitch-black depths of hell onto a little girl and her woefully screwed mom in D.C. If you don’t know the face of Pazuzu yet, you will have that unholy magic burned into your brain after just one viewing. Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) tries his best, but decades later, the late actor’s son, who is now a genre filmmaker himself, is still grappling with what happened to the unlucky man on those godforsaken stairs. —AF The opening shot of blaxploitation was significantly more radical than what came after. Multi-hyphenate creator Melvin Van Peebles’ goal with this 1971 firebomb — which came in the wake of his first and only Hollywood production, “The Watermelon Man” — was nothing less than a complete annihilation of conventional cinematic form, as he defied every rule of Hollywood production and editing to create “the first Black Power film” (even going so far as to arm his crew). Bolstered by the support of the Black Panther Party and the tagline, “Rated X by an All-White Jury,” Van Peebles’ missive became a massive box office hit despite — or perhaps because of — its unblinking approach to sex and brutality. Fifty years on, “Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song” is still incendiary, challenging, and one of a kind. —KR An unsparingly nativist satire of colonial arrogance, Nelson Pereira dos Santos’ cinema novo masterpiece remains one of film history’s most cutting rebukes against the white savior narrative that it has done so much to propagate over the last 125 years. Set in 16th century Brazil, the deliciously titled “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” stars Arduíno Colassanti as an unnamed settler who’s captured by the indigenous Tupinambás — who believe him to be Portuguese — and told that he will be ritualistically eaten in eight months. It’s not a promising situation for our protagonist, but after being assigned a young wife (Ana Maria Magalhães as Seboipepe) and given free run of her village, our blond “hero” begins to grow comfortable in his new surroundings. He even starts to adopt the local customs and dress (or lack thereof), confident that his captors will come to recognize the savagery of their own customs in the face of his evolved Christian grace. He even appears to fall in love with Seboipepe, and assumes the feeling is mutual. Spoiler alert: There’s a reason why this movie isn’t called “I Didn’t Eat My Husband.” It turns out that Seboipepe is mostly concerned with claiming the best piece of white meat. From its title on down, “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” is inflexibly — gleefully — rooted in the perspective of the Tupinambás, whose understanding of the world has been untainted by the hegemony of the European invaders. That ahistorical point-of-view will ultimately lead to their extermination, but not before Pereira dos Santos is able to reverse the time-honored prejudices of Western filmmaking and create a story that identifies with the conquered at all costs. In doing so, he offers a bitingly sardonic reminder that history is easier to swallow than it is to digest. —DE A product of the Direct Cinema movement of observational documentary filmmaking that gave birth to masterpieces like “Grey Gardens” and “Don’t Look Back,” “Gimme Shelter” was born when directors Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were allowed to tag along on the final three weeks of the Rolling Stones’ legendary 1969 tour. What could have been a straightforward rock doc — featuring some impressive behind-the-scenes footage and performances from the legendary band — instead became a chronicle of something far greater when the filmmakers captured the infamous Altamont Free Concert that capped the group’s American leg, complete with footage of the killing of concertgoer Meredith Hunter. Shot with a hazy lens that appropriately feels like an acid trip, “Gimme Shelter” documents all the managerial and organizational failure that allowed the concert to descend into chaos, and the discordant, nightmarish events of the night itself. One of the rawest and most unvarnished non-fiction films of its time period, “Gimme Shelter” is more than a concert doc, its a portrait of a changing era, as the dreams of the ‘60s made way for the cynicism of the ‘70s. —WC Few actors embody everything great about ‘70s cinema better than Gene Hackman. A late bloomer who seemingly stumbled backwards into an acting career, his unvarnished everyman characters were highlights of many of the decade’s best films. And his talents were never put to better use than as Harry R. Caul (a homophonically droll name for a wiretapper), a surveillance expert who falls down a rabbit hole of paranoia after hearing what he believes to be dangerous information that could affect a couple he was hired to spy on. The performance takes a quintessential Hollywood archetype — the washed up man who has long sworn off morality after being haunted by past mistakes — and updates it for a world in which nobody felt like they could trust a word that anyone else was saying. Francis Ford Coppola, in the midst of his all-time great filmmaking run, is at the height of his technical powers, using intricately composed shots of San Francisco and brilliant sound design to illustrate Caul’s mastery of surveillance and his earned distrust in the people who employ him. But the stylization is all grounded in the sad portrait of the character’s life that Coppola and Hackman paint for us. I have personally never attended a surveillance equipment convention, but it’s not hard to imagine how quickly your trust would erode if you spent all of your days hanging out with private sector spies eager to brag about the latest answering machine they broke into. Amid a sea of self-described paranoid thrillers from a very paranoid decade, “The Conversation” stands out among the finest because it managed to meet a national moment without ever having to diverge from its protagonist’s natural truths. —CZ In the films of Jacques Rivette, Paris is less a city than a giant stage or playground upon which characters project imagined dramas, but none of his work takes that idea to a more fantastical extreme than “Duelle.” Here, Juliet Berto and Bulle Ogier’s cryptic femmes fatales are not merely young bohemians roaming around town making up conspiracies and mysteries to add spice to their lives but goddesses in mortal form engaged in a contest of wills that predates human life. As the women gradually orient themselves toward their latest cosmic confrontation, they occupy the rest of their time tempting mortals into their thrall with behaviors heavily indebted to classic noir. In the process, Rivette crafts an impressionistic tribute to everything from Marlene Dietrich’s collaborations with von Sternberg, Weimar-era expressionistic thrillers, even the lucid-dreaming poetic mythology of Jean Cocteau. Eschewing mere homage for a sublimation of past forms into something new, “Duelle” reconfigures the cinephilia of the Cahiers critic-filmmakers into a vision of cinema as timeless as the oldest myths of the ancient world. —JC Clint Eastwood was already the star and director of numerous westerns by the time he made “The Outlaw Josey Wales,” but it was here he fully emerged from the shadows of early collaborators Sergio Leone and Don Siegel to establish himself as the true heir to John Ford’s vision of the West. Physically and psychologically scarred by the Civil War, Eastwood’s Josey is a vision of rage so uncontrollable that the massacre of surrendering comrades by Union troops seems more a convenient excuse for inevitable bloodshed than justifiable cause. As in “The Searchers,” the film gradually pulls its protagonist back from the edge of damnation, but where Ford’s movie offers moral clarity at the last possible second, Eastwood’s confronts its hero’s anger throughout the story. As Josey assembles a makeshift caravan of Native Americans, harassed homesteaders, and other unfortunate souls, Eastwood draws constant but understated attention to the contrast between the Confederate’s aggrievement and the larger framework of racial, gender, and class violence in America. Slowly but surely, this wrathful Lost Cause thriller morphs into an unsentimental but nonetheless hopeful vision of community solidarity as the only true defense against the predations of individuals and systems. —JC Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1975, and still the only African film to have ever been awarded that prize, “Chronicles of the Years of Fire” is both a political epic and a personal account of Algeria’s struggle for independence. Director Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina stages the story with large-scale set pieces, poetic monologues, and sweeping cinematography. Crucially, however, he avoids triumphalism at every turn. Instead, his film traces how colonial violence reshaped everyday life and made revolt inevitable. It’s long, demanding, and often theatrical, but always urgent. Few African films have matched its scale, and even fewer have carried this kind of historical weight on the world stage. —TO Shudder’s “Dario Argento Panico” is an essential documentary primer for any cinephile just getting into the complex, supersaturated legacy of Italy’s most notorious genre filmmaker. Understanding the dark psychology of a man who conjured up unfathomable suspense and horror — then repeatedly cast his real wife and kids as exquisite centerpieces in those artful nightmares — is, how do you say, “tutta una cosa.” That’s Italian for “a whole thing,” and basically the entire point for dedicated fans of the director. Effectively standing in for a decade of brilliant giallo on this list, “Suspiria” is more than up to the task. The eerie magic Argento first conjured up in 1977 is best remembered for its illustrious use of color, even with “Deep Red” right there in the director’s filmography. The crimson splatters and jewel-colored glass that adorn the German ballet school where “Suspiria” takes place make it a crowning achievement in the pantheon of visual horror. That masterful dreamscape is reflected in the eyes of a young American dancer, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), whose serpentine descent into supernatural madness plays out like a lethal recital on psychedelics. Loosely translated, “Suspiria” means “breathing” or “to take a deep breath.” That quietly sensual undercurrent might explain why “Challengers” director Luca Guadagnino and “50 Shades” muse Dakota Johnson teamed up to revive Argento’s classic as a high-concept art film with a well-disguised Tilda Swinton in the critically-acclaimed remake from 2018. The original can’t evoke quite the same visceral response as that film’s updated effects, but anyone whose seen the atrium-hanging sequence should be able to convince you to watch both versions. Trite but true, there’s more than one way for a witch to step on your neck. —AF One of the final films by the great Luis Buñuel, “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” moves from dinner party to dinner party in a disorienting haze, each moment bleeding into the next. True to its title, the cast of characters we follow are a group of six well-off French men and women, each containing a sense of smug satisfaction and an underlying restlessness in their comfortable, mannered lives. Their attempts to dine together are thwarted by a series of vignettes both “real” and dreamed, from terrorist attacks to ghostly encounters to the discovery that their lives are actually a stage play. Buñuel’s comedy is dry as a bone, with each absurdity readily accepted by the passive ensemble. The film pokes and prods them mercilessly, with each mishap peeling away at the fundamental spiritual rot within them. It’s that unflinching meanness towards its own characters that makes “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” one of the great satires in all of film history. —WC So much of Ingmar Bergman’s work was defined by the women who brought his intimate, existential dramas to life, and with whom he frequently had tempestuous romances off-screen. Kicking off an impressive late-period run from the Swedish auteur before his retirement in 1982, “Cries and Whispers,” gives one of his first muses — Harriet Andersson — a harrowing showcase that doubles as a reflection on how much time has passed since she was the ingenue launched to stardom by Bergman’s “Summer With Monika.” In this austere psychological tragedy, Andersson plays a noblewoman tucked away in a country manor dying slowly from disease, with two sisters (Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin) who are distant to both her and each other. As flashbacks reveal the cruelties that curdled this family, Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist bathe the film in a stark red glow, bringing fire to an icy, despairing work. And Andersson is devastating as the frail woman at the center, giving her last leading performance for the director whom her career was forever intertwined. —WC Glowing and electric, George A. Romero’s masterful “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) is iconic for a reason. But the sequel that followed his feature debut a decade later, “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), lies at the heart of a truly beloved filmography. Despite studio interference and a lack of financial stability throughout his otherwise successful artistic life, Romero is remembered as the sensitive American filmmaker whose steadfast commitment to the underdog gave the cinematic undead their reputation for social consciousness. At their most memorable, scary movies have long reflected how we can do better as people — alone or en masse. Created after several years of its director exploring other less terrifying realms, Romero’s genre homecoming endures as a remarkable collaboration between him, co-producer Dario Argento, the musical group known as the Band Goblin (credited in the film as The Goblins), and special effects wizard Tom Savini. The strongest and most ghoulish worship comes from community, and the action, comedy, and horror film worlds socialize as much as the artists here. Set inside a shopping mall, “Dawn of the Dead” sees combat collide with corpses as the zombie apocalypse from the first movie blooms into a bigger production for Romero. This nightmare is more philosophically complex, too. (Not like “Day of the Dead” levels of enlightenment, but you know, within reason.) Romero’s script masterfully disassembles the concept of a literal safe house under capitalism to explore the complacency it breeds, and to suggest that even the bravest leaders among us won’t know to burn it all down until it’s too late. —AF Med Hondo’s 1979 epic is so compelling that merely describing it is sufficient justification for its inclusion on this list. Filmed aboard a reconstructed slave ship inside an abandoned French factory, with a budget totalling $1.35 million (making it the most expensive African film ever at the time), “West Indies” is a musical satire/non-linear historiography of French colonialism. It is a whirlwind of post-Fanon interpolations with an unsparing, furious clarity of purpose. Hondo paints the history of the Caribbean under French rule as one where revolution is co-opted by capitalism, where artistic expression is disallowed without sufficient cultural assimilation, and where violence and displacement persist under the guise of progress. All of this might have amounted to little more than a politically astute curio were it not for Hondo’s total command of Western spectacle. “West Indies” has some of the greatest musical numbers ever filmed, with a dizzying sense of scale, intricacy, and imagination. Hondo plainly outdoes many of the pop artists he satirizes. The result is a blisteringly intelligent referendum on the rotten core of Euro-American cinema, and an equally potent tribute to the resilient fullness of African cultures. —SB The money alone is notable: Made for less than $9 million, “Jaws” went on to make over $470 million in global returns, including a $260 million domestic take that earned it the top spot at the box office in 1975. The film toppled other high-powered hits like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Dog Day Afternoon,” all huge moneymakers that were decidedly non-blockbuster in nature. And “Jaws” was the first feature film to break $235 million in domestic returns. Steven Spielberg’s big hit — his first, and obviously not his last — paved the way for the massive tentpole features that now dominate the summer season, huge earners that capture both the zeitgeist and hefty audiences. The secret? It’s one that filmmakers of any generation can stand to learn, remember, and take to heart: the film is good. So many blockbusters not only eschew overall quality in service to whiz-bang entertainment and speedy fun, but they do it with truly disposal amusements. Nothing about “Jaws” is throwaway. Meticulously built from stem to stern, “Jaws” takes pains to steep us in the world of small-town Amity (it means friendship!) long before a seriously large and biblically pissed off shark makes mincemeat of many of its citizens and everyone’s nerves. Neatly divided into two distinct sections – a landlubbing first half that tracks a small town on the edge, none of it helped by a mayor who doesn’t really see a need to mess with holiday fun, no matter how many people die, followed by an alternately claustrophobic and just kinda fun death sail on the high seas — “Jaws” builds both its tension and character evolution with steady hands. While we may briefly wonder who is going to beat this thing – Ocean-adverse chief of police Martin Brody (Roy Scheider)? Grizzled fisherman and battered war hero Quint (Robert Shaw)? Know-it-all wino marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)? – the real question is, who is going to survive and what the hell does that even look like? Luckily for us, “Jaws” itself endures. —KE Jacques Rivette’s prankish, exuberant, and restlessly energetic “Céline and Julie Go Boating” boasts one of the all-time great cinematic friendships. It’s also a total explosion of the rules of cinematic storytelling, and one of the most innovative features of the 1970s — no small feat. Dominique Labourier plays Julie, a reverie-prone librarian who meets Céline (Juliet Berto) in a sequence straight out of Lewis Carroll, as Céline keeps dropping objects that Julie can’t chase her down fast enough to return. That sets the stage for an enchanting, but never precious or twee, tale of doubles… in addition to a love triangle, a mysterious house, and a subplot about a psychedelic candy that allows the two women — who become fast friends and roommates after that chance meeting — to seemingly bend the rules of time altogether. Here’s where Rivette tosses yet another genre, the murder mystery melodrama, into “Céline and Julie” in ways that gleefully reinvent the very references he’s trying to make and then subvert. “Céline and Julie Go Boating” feels in many ways like the original hangout movie of the 1970s, bouncing along episodically, more jaunty picaresque than manic pixie dream girl omnibus. Despite running nearly three-and-a-half hours, this allusion-heavy (and illusion-heavy) movie is made totally accessible by Rivette’s disorienting and tradition-disrupting style. More than that, it feels like a fresh discovery each time you rewatch it. —RL “Everything begins and ends at the exactly right time and place,” says an Australian schoolgirl with dead eyes and a breathy, bated voice at a pivotal moment in Peter Weir’s lastingly elusive “Picnic at Hanging Rock.” Ushering in a New Wave of Australian 1970s cinema that put the country’s film scene on the global map, Weir’s masterpiece remains equally influential for contemporary filmmakers such as Sofia Coppola, who picked up Weir’s mantle as the cinema’s reigning master of dazed blonde women strung out on fainting couches. Like patterns in the clouds, you can read almost anything into the bottomless pit of mystery that becomes the center of this unforgettably strange portrait of sexual repression, written by screenwriter Cliff Green. It’s Valentine’s Day, 1900, at the fictional all-girls boarding school called Appleyard College, where a group of students head out toward a geological formation, Hanging Rock, in Victoria. Three vanish without a trace, seemingly into a crevice in the formation. The sighting of a strange red cloud that coincided with the three young women’s seeming evaporation into nowhere, as told by Edith (Christine Schuler), could be read as a limpid, subtle-as-a-chainsaw metaphor for looming femininity and the disappearances themselves as the loss of innocence into adulthood. More memorable than its symbolism, however, is the seductive, ethereal, and dread-spiked atmosphere “Picnic at Hanging Rock” conjures, leaving you in as dazed a spell as the protagonists whose dilemma remains stubbornly unsolved. That’s where Weir’s chillingly directed film gets its extraordinary power. —RL Banned after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and thought lost for decades, Mohammad Reza Aslani’s miraculous “Chess of the Wind” wasn’t widely seen until its 2020 restoration, when it arrived with the feeling of a priceless discovery. Set almost entirely inside a decaying aristocratic mansion in early 20th century Tehran, the film is a tightly controlled chamber drama about inheritance and control. A paralyzed woman battles her stepfamily for power, while servants lurk and loyalties shift in silence. The stillness is deceptive; every movement, glance, and sound is loaded with meaning. Its surface recalls the visual grammar of 1970s festival auteurs, but Aslani builds a world anchored in the historical textures of Iranian society, shaped by class conflict, gendered power, and a quiet subversion of patriarchy. Its formal control and long absence make it one of the most arresting rediscoveries in recent world cinema history. —TO The fate of the midnight movie is still pretty much at the mercy of kids who can’t decide if they should cancel each other for liking “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” But Brian de Palma’s “Phantom of the Paradise” reigns supreme as the definitive best piece of flashy genre cinema from the 1970s — a glorious ode to a rocker punished for his passion that was itself tortured on its rocky road to theaters. Thanks to a nonsensical legal challenge from Led Zeppelin, moviegoers have to be pretty lucky to catch De Palma’s extraordinary 1974 glam opera as it was meant to be seen. Censorship plagues all publicly available versions of the film, and a particularly egregious restoration from a physical media release a few years ago left many fans disturbed by the intricate production details lost to its poorly updated color. Still, whichever version you watch, the tragic tale of musical genius Winslow Leach (William Finley) shines through as a timeless testament to the power of talented freaks with a song to sing. Paul Williams scored “Phantom of the Paradise,” which also casts the Grammy-winning composer as the villainous namesake executive for Swan Records. Swan destroys what could be a quick rise to fame for Winslow and his band, The Juicy Fruits, when he steals the basis for their first hit song. Enter Beef (Gerrit Graham), a competitive diva whose effort to help Swan screw over Winslow ends explosively. The glittery terror that surrounds that reveal commingles bejeweled platforms and fishnets (with some of the more disturbing elements of the Gypsy Rose Blanchard story?) in a singular “Phantom of the Opera” homage. It also sees “Suspiria” final girl Jessica Harper centerstage as its fresh-faced Angel of Music in a performance that could almost make you forget the movies’ later attempts at creating their own Christine. —AF Dripping with style and sick with unease in its portrait of an emotionally detached man (Jean Louis-Trintignant) hired to assassinate his ex-fascist former professor, Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Conformist” illuminates its protagonist’s psyche with a scintillating dance of light and shadow — an approach that would have an enormous influence on Francis Ford Coppola as he ramped up to make “The Godfather.” Shooting in Rome and Paris as well as Cinecittà Studios in Italy, production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (unjustly robbed of an Oscar nomination for his hugely influential work here) summoned the vibes of 1930s Fascist Italy with extraordinary detail, emboldened by Bertolucci’s baroque style. At the center of this cold — but never bloodless — movie is the relationship between Marcello (Trintignant) and Anna (Dominique Sanda), the professor’s wife whom he falls in love with fatal consequences. Those consequences are realized in a disturbing and suspenseful sequence that elegantly summarizes the movie’s themes of cowardice, repression, betrayal, offering an ultimate reminder of Marcello’s own fecklessness. Antiheroes became a dominant trademark of 1970s cinema both abroad and in the United States; look toward the moral complexities of Marcello for an early figurehead of that trope, all wrapped up in a doom-laden but ecstatically glorious movie. —RL A three-part nonfiction epic, Patricio Guzman’s black-and-white masterpiece is unrivaled as the premier filmic document preserving the memory of Chile before, during, and after one of its most troubled chapters, which has defined its modern history. Starting in the months before military dictator Augusto Pinochet came to power by force, Guzman set his camera against a country in crisis. The first installment, 1975’s “The Insurrection of the Bourgeoisie,” hinges on the director’s interviews with working class people as they take to the streets to demonstrate in defense of Salvador Allende’s government, and to denounce how the elite has fought to maintain their privileged position at the expense of the masses. On the ground amid the turmoil, “The Coup d’état” goes on to bear witness to violent clashes, hopeful protests, ardent speeches, and ultimately to the U.S.-backed overthrow of Allende on September 11, 1973, which ushered in a dark period for the South American nation. The final part, “Popular Power,” winds back the clock to serve as something of a prequel, as Guzman explores the proletariat’s frustrated attempts at reclaiming their power. Although forced into exile for decades, the acclaimed filmmaker has since continued to observe Chile’s transformation over the years, and to investigate his own complicated relationship with the country of his birth in several subsequent works (including 1997’s “Chile, Obstinate Memory,” which found Guzman screening his trilogy for Chileans who had never seen it before). But none of those later projects, strong as they are, can hope to match the potency of watching history change from within the eye of the storm. —CA It’s impossible to study “Apocalypse Now” in a vacuum, as the film’s legacy will always be defined by the history surrounding it: the famously harrowing shoot that pushed Francis Ford Coppola to his limits and inspired the excellent documentary “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse,” the dramatic Cannes premiere where Coppola’s massive bet paid off with a Palme d’Or win, and the director’s insistence to continue revising it into the 21st century. But even without succumbing to the crass temptation to use filmmaking as a metaphor for war, time and distance have proved that the chaos underscoring “Apocalypse Now” have only strengthened its legacy. The most appropriately pessimistic film by one of America’s greatest optimists, it’s now easy to see “Apocalypse Now” as the end of the New Hollywood era. That has far more to do with correlation than causation, but it’s also symbolically fitting: After a decade of watching the industry release auteur-driven films about the gaping hole that the Vietnam War left in America society, Coppola tackled the war that lurked over the decade’s other masterpieces so directly that it’s hard to shake the feeling that filmmakers moved on because there was nothing left to say. It would be impossible to determine exactly how much of the film’s chaos was pre-planned, and how much emerged naturally from a shoot so grueling shoot that it seemed as if God was determined to punish the auteur for his ambition. But Coppola’s vision resonated for a reason, and the pairing of his prescient foresight — about how the military would evolve in a direction of specialization that allows for even greater brutality — and the lucid observation that war brings out sides of men that they’re not capable of looking in the mirror proved to be a lethal combo. “Apocalypse Now” is New Hollywood radicalism executed on a scale that few of his peers ever received a chance to try. It’s a coda to two eras of American history, one artistic and one historical, and remains the definitive portrayal of a war that defined a generation. —CZ This isn’t to say that Hollis Frampton’s “(nostalgia)” is necessarily the greatest experimental film of the 1970s (competition for that useless title abounds, even from the other chapters of the artist’s “Hapax Legomena” film cycle), but rather to argue that it might be the most productive experimental film of the 1970s to put on a commercial-oriented list such as this one. Epitomizing the “structural” cinema movement that Frampton rejected as a coherent framework, “(nostalgia”) is a singularly potent gateway drug to another universe of moviemaking — one in which the shape of a film can be the ultimate expression of its content. To watch “(nostalgia”) is to discover, reconnect with, or simply exalt in the idea that there is something inherently profound, and in this case also extremely poignant, to the materials and construction of cinema itself. Here, the materials are simple, their construction is plain, and the deep well of feeling that Frampton conjures between them is raw, lucid, and inviting. Thirty-eight minutes. Thirteen photographs. One electric burner. A formative picture from the early days of the filmmaker’s career is placed on a hot plate, where it disintegrates in the flames as a plainspoken voice — speaking in the first person, but in fact belonging to avant-garde legend Michael Snow — discusses the image in the context of Frampton’s life. The images are evocatively unremarkable, the narration diaristic yet vaguely wounded. Old friends. Half-forgotten places. A pair of toilets sitting next to each other. Before long, the viewer begins to notice a glitch in the matrix: The narration isn’t describing the picture on screen, it’s describing the next picture to come. The effect is as temporally destabilizing as being ambushed by the smell of your childhood home: We’re hearing about a photograph we haven’t seen yet, and looking at a photograph we’ve already heard described. That basic misalignment is enough to create a strange and movingly porous middle ground in the space between anticipation and memory, as the pain of reflecting upon the past is dimensionalized by the natural human impulse to cast ourselves forwards into the future. Time eventually reduces it all to ash and silence, but not before Frampton is able to glimpse a fleeting truth of some kind in the movie’s dying seconds — a nowness that no other medium can give us. “Here it is. Look at it! Do you see what I see?” “(nostalgia)” is an invitation to never stop looking. —DE Has any director ever cared more about how a movie “feels” than Robert Altman with “McCabe & Mrs. Miller”? The film evokes wintry rain and snow and the puffs of dry heat from a pot-belly stove so well you almost feel like you can see Altman’s breath fogging up the camera lens. One of the greatest of all “winter Westerns,” this parable about commerce — and the role that affection and jealousy and violence play in the holding it all together — is an inimitable, oil-lamp-lit gaze into the past that also reflects the light of an eternal present at the same time. Warren Beatty wears a bear-skin coat so thick it makes you warm just to look at it. And he in turn warms the hopes of a small Pacific Northwest logging town with his card-playing skills, rictus grin, and declaration that he’s a “businessman.” Partnering with a veteran madam in Julie Christie, they open a brothel for the town, the one hope for salvation from the grim reality of the everyday — especially since the long-awaited Presbyterian Church is never quite finished. If transcendence isn’t possible, being a sinner can be the best way to endure capitalism. It sure encourages everyone to give it a shot. Pitched between a grimed-up materialism and dreamy aspirations — epitomized to perfection by the Leonard Cohen songs Altman put on the soundtrack with lyrics like “I’m just a Joseph looking for a manger” — “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is the greatest kind of period piece: One that isn’t an escape into the past, but a way to better understand how we arrived at the present. —CB Shot over a series of weekends in South Central Los Angeles, Charles Burnett’s “Killer of Sheep” remains one of the most quietly profound films in all of American cinema. With nonprofessional actors and a focus on everyday detail, it follows a slaughterhouse worker weighed down by routine and fatigue. There is no clear plot, just fragments of life, captured with care and restraint — every one of its images feels etched in stone but fully alive at the same time. Burnett, a key figure in the L.A. Rebellion, made a film about Black working-class life without any trace of sentiment or spectacle. Its 2007 restoration brought overdue attention, but the film has always carried the same lucid clarity and profound emotional weight. —TO Screenwriter Paul Schrader’s compulsion towards male isolation, modern disaffect, and the pursuit of transcendence that promises to alleviate them both has never been more potent than it remains in his original masterpiece. Each of the film’s unimaginably bold swings lands cleanly because the script does all of the little things right. As so many have pointed out, the appalling choice to make Jodie Foster’s Iris Steensma a literal child prostitute at just 12-years-old was the only way to create a moral travesty so utterly black-and-white that it could push a morally ambivalent man to forfeit his life for a cause. That transition from fringe observer to self-defined martyr unfolds with perfect cyclicality, affording Travis Bickle a Hero’s Journey within his own head without giving us any reason to believe that we’re leaving him any better off. “Taxi Driver” is in many ways the quintessential New Hollywood film, and so much ink has been spilled about what that means — from its unapologetic portrayal of post-Vietnam bitterness to its refusal to fully cut ties with the classic storytelling traditions of “The Searchers” — that blurbing Martin Scorsese’s most sordid masterpiece seems like a waste of bandwidth. But faced with the gravity of a true masterpiece, perhaps the most radical thing we can do is look at all the misinterpretations and cheap knock-offs it inspired and sincerely conclude that it was all still worth it to get the movie we did. It’s hard to think of a higher compliment to give a film than “You’re the reason we got two ‘Joker’ movies, and yet the world is still undeniably richer for your existence.” —CZ Paris in the daytime has never felt as desolate as it does in Jean Eustache’s 220-minute relationship drama. Presenting the collapse of May ‘68 as the intellectual equivalent of Paris’s fall to the Nazis, the film depicts the city as an eerily barren metropolis populated only by small groups of emotionally atomized citizens each absorbed in their own diversions and work. No one embodies this retreat into solipsism better than Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a student leftist turned reactionary in the wake of the progressive movement’s collapse at the end of the ‘60s. Ranting and raving about the failures of permissive society and the loss of traditional values, Alexandre nonetheless pursues two women he wants only for sex. Eustache’s film is an unsparing, eternally relevant overview of the manner in which jilted leftists can retreat into conservatism. The director even puts the ostensible progressivism of the French New Wave under a microscope, pointedly casting Nouvelle Vague poster child Léaud and positioning his character’s unchecked cinephilia as just one form of his fetishization of the past. But the filmmaker also depicts ongoing resistance of a kind, as the gradually forming bond between Veronika and Marie offers a refusal to submit to Alexandre’s attempted reassertion of chauvinist power — and a determination to retain the breakthroughs of the prior decade. —JC The most sinister and dreamlike of ’70s paranoid thrillers (its elusive sense of evil born from the unfinished state of David Giler and Lorenzo Semple Jr.’s script, the sociopathic disaffectedness of Gordon Willis’ cinematography, and the two-note twinkle of Michael Small’s synth score), Alan J. Pakula’s “The Parallax View” is a film born from the creeping unease that settled into American life as the country’s post-war idealism began to seem like the ultimate cover-up. It’s a cover-up that Warren Beatty’s guilt-ridden journalist is determined to uncover, and — in the wake of surviving a yacht explosion and foiling a bomb threat to a commercial airplane — it almost seems as if he might be able to expose the plot to assassinate the most progressive senators who popped up after Kennedy was gunned down. If only a thick feather cut and a dream were enough to set the world to rights. No such luck for the fearless Joe Frady, who finds himself at the center of a plot in which heroes are little more than handsome patsies, and villains hardly seem to have faces at all. Staged with hypnotic impassivity from the moment it starts (the spectacular opening sequence atop the Seattle Space Needle all the more impactful for its casual disregard), “The Parallax View” puts forward a much smarter and more calculated vision of a deep state conspiracy than the one we got. All the same, its closed-loop concept of American entropy — and its unnerving insistence that the truth can kill you without fully revealing itself — continues to resonate on a much darker wavelength than any of Pakula’s other ’70s classics. —DE First released 50 years ago, after Francoist censors convinced themselves that its anti-authoritarian messaging would have little social impact if buried under such a “boring” art film, Victor Erice’s “The Spirit of the Beehive” follows a gullible six-year-old girl named Ana (Ana Torrent), who sees a screening of “Frankenstein” when a mobile cinema arrives in the small Castilian village where she lives with her family in the Spanish Civil War’s immediate aftermath. Confused and horrified by the sight of Frankenstein’s monster accidentally killing a child, and the townspeople then killing Frankenstein’s monster in return, Ana’s elder sister tells her that neither of those things actually happened — that everything you see in films is fake. Later, with the memories of James Whale’s movie still fresh in her mind, Ana discovers a wounded republican soldier hiding in a sheepfold and decides to treat him with kindness instead of fear. It makes no difference to his ultimate fate. Ana’s sister was only half right in the end: “Frankenstein” may be a work of fiction, but fiction isn’t the same thing as “fake.” Erice has only made three other features since his spellbinding debut, but all have been set in the same liminal space between film and reality that he explored in his first. As beguiling and hard to shake as any movie ever made (just ask Guillermo del Toro), “The Spirit of the Beehive” sinks so deeply under the skin for its ability to fulfill cinema — and “Frankenstein”’s — promise of eternal return; its capacity as a magic trick capable of keeping the past alive long after it’s already died within us. The movies are real, Erice has always insisted. This one allows you to see that clearly. —DE As unforgivable as it is to reduce an Andrei Tarkovsky film to a 1:1 allegory for a specific current event, it’s hard to watch “Solaris” these days without feeling like it was made for 2025. It was probably made for quite a few other years too (many of which haven’t happened yet), but watching AI-generated recreations of deceased crime victims give interviews on talk shows and statements in courtrooms is a convenient reminder that Tarkovsky’s wisdom was ahead of its time.No other science-fiction film has ever been so bold in its assertion that science as a vocation isn’t all that great. “Solaris” begins with the scientific community doubting each other’s testimony to the point where they send a psychiatrist into space to audit — and potentially shut down — a research mission. When the cosmonaut makes it to the space station, he discovers that the crew’s unsupervised observation of the strange magnetic fields surrounding the ocean planet Solaris have driven one person to suicide and caused dangerous hallucinations among everyone else. And yet, despite being armed with all of the prior knowledge that nothing he sees on the ship will be real, our hero is powerless to resist a vision of his dead wife, which is is enough to make him abandon his scientific principles for a cheap facsimile of someone he once loved. It’s a moment of intellectual weakness and a major lapse in professional judgement, but anyone who says they’d act differently is lying to themselves. Tarkovsky mines the tension between the lofty ideas that guide science and the fallen nature of the humans who try to pursue them, and this sprawling, highly symbolic film is rife with many of the ideas that fascinated him throughout his entire career: that there are secrets in the world that humans aren’t meant to understand, that we’re fools to try and analyze things that should only be experienced spiritually, and that esoteric quests for metaphysical meaning are only undertaken by broken people with nothing better to do. Looking out the window towards a society that appears increasingly convinced to invent the technologies that will burn it to the ground simply because we have the technology to do so, we’d all be well-served to remember one of the film’s most profound quotes: “We’re in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal he fears, that he has no need for.” —CZ “Days of Heaven” is a gem that has only grown more luminous with time. Filmmaker Terrence Malick was then still an emerging voice, now he’s viewed as one of American cinema’s most singular auteurs. After making his debut with 1973’s “Badlands,” Malick returned five years later with a film that’s as visually arresting as it is narratively elusive. Shot largely during the vaunted “magic hour” and steeped in natural light, “Days of Heaven” emerged from a notoriously difficult post-production process. The footage took two years to shape into a cohesive narrative, but the final product earned critical acclaim — and four Oscar nominations, including a win for Néstor Almendros’ haunting cinematography. Nearly five decades on — and with films like “The Thin Red Line” and “The Tree of Life” only expanding his mythos — Malick’s sophomore effort is seen not only as a foundational text in his body of work, but as one of the defining films of the ’70s. Its reputation rests not just on its painterly visuals, but on the dreamlike way it tells its deceptively simple tale. Richard Gere stars as Bill, a drifter who convinces his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) to pose as his sister so she can marry a dying farmer (Sam Shepard) for his land. Linda Manz, who also provides the film’s ethereal voiceover, plays Bill’s actual sister, tagging along as the trio’s fragile arrangement begins to unravel. Like “Badlands,” “Days of Heaven” is remarkably lean. Despite the drawn-out editing process, the film clocks in at just 94 minutes — a rarity in Malick’s later, more sprawling work. Within that brief running time, he crafts something hypnotic, lyrical, and emotionally resonant. The film’s centerpiece — a literal blaze of glory on a wheat farm — remains one of the most indelible images in American cinema. —RC An exploitation film released in 1974 with a title as shocking and to-the-point as “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was never going to struggle to earn back its $140,000 budget, but that didn’t stop Tobe Hooper from reaching for the moon and tearing an irreparable cosmic rift in horror cinema. Stripped of the artificiality that tended to soften the genre, Hooper’s unvarnished masterpiece subjected moviegoers to some of the most nauseating imagery ever captured on film without so much as a moment to take a breath. The practical effects and the barbarity of the tool-powered killings hold up to this day, but it’s because of the film’s deceptively sophisticated pathos that it’s so entrenched itself in our collective psyche. Leatherface isn’t motivated by the kind of malice or revenge that drive so many other horror villains — he’s a mentally disabled man raised by a perverse family with no means of supporting him after their jobs at the slaughterhouse disappeared. Forgotten by a society that was already beginning to rot, his family’s brutal actions were underscored by the notion that something similar could be lurking at the end of any innocuous-seeming country road.The scariest part of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” is its utter nihilism. Hooper’s film remains so unsettling because of how blatantly it rejects the binary of good guys and bad, binary, offering us all a hideous reminder that we’re all just animals who are capable of inflicting unimaginable evils on each other once the paper-thin norms separating us from our instincts start to crumble. —CZ It’s all bad vibes and dark times in Nicolas Roeg’s hugely upsetting, weirdly tender, not quite sexy but surprisingly carnal study of mourning, “Don’t Look Now.” Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland bare it all and so much more as a WASP and a British Protestant who stare into the abyss of the absolute worst thing that could happen to any two parents — their daughter drowning in the shallowest of ponds, right outside their own English countryside home. Where most contemporary horror movies that center on grieving couples (i.e. “Antichrist,” which blurs Roeg into Tarkovsky) tend to fling them to, say, a remote cabin in the woods as a backdrop for healing, “Don’t Look Now” instead sends its grief-dazed protagonists to the crowded canals of Venice, Italy. It’s there that Sutherland’s character, John Baxter, has agreed to restore an ancient church, hauling Laura —who seems almost suspiciously emotionally blinkered given recent events — along with him. But the city’s rabbit-warren corridors, as established in Daphne du Maurier’s source novel, become M.C. Escher-esque grief portals as Laura becomes obsessed with a pair of supposedly psychic geriatric sisters. Meanwhile, there is a small person with a red hood — the very one the Baxters’ daughter wore the day she died — running around the city. “Don’t Look Now” is most infamous for a sex scene nested within Roeg’s trademark style of cross-cutting, in which two events in parallel yet discrete timelines appear to be happening at once. John and Laura are both dressing and undressing, fucking and then not fucking, with armpit-licking and cunnilingus that shocked audiences and censorship boards and by present day standards certainly isn’t prude. But what it wasn’t, and isn’t, is gratuitous. On the contrary, it situates “Don’t Look Now” as more emotionally raw-nerved romantic drama than true horror movie. Though you can’t forget the climax, which is one of the greatest of all cinematic rug-pulls, made all the more incredible by the fact that Roeg got away with it. This is the original “elevated horror”: knockout performances, skillful craft, and a director who undersides the dual sides of manipulating and cajoling actors and who can elevate schlocky material. —RL According to Elia Kazan, Barbara Loden’s last words — which she furiously spoke on her deathbed as her body gave out from breast cancer — were, “Shit, shit, shit.” Throughout their professional collaboration and marriage, the director — who cast actress-turned-filmmaker Loden in “Splendor in the Grass” — allegedly tried to undercut her autonomy and dismissed her creative ambitions. But the ambition of a woman operating below the studio system and out from her ex-husband’s eye paved the way for Loden’s “Wanda,” a troubling, often grimly hilarious and Cassavetes-adjacent landmark in the history of independent film. Played by Loden herself, Wanda is as apathetic as any woman as we’ve seen onscreen, languishing through life amid a pile-up of disappointments: She’s left her husband, granting him full custody of their children, and doesn’t protest when it’s time to sign the divorce papers. Loden, who had two children with Kazan, modeled the character after a version of herself: wandering, adrift, between jobs and between men, wedding her autobiography to a thinly sketched bank robbery plot that’s more background noise than the thrust of this existential tone poem of a 16mm-shot movie. One of the wisest, most piercingly drawn scenes in “Wanda” finds the heroine idling through a shopping mall, matching eyes with mannequins that both reflect her own soul-drained blankness and the status divided between her dreams and achievements, these life-sized “human” models adorned in clothes she could never afford. Here is one of the great portraits of a woman trying to find a place in the world, her world; she doesn’t find it by the end of the film, but the largesse of strangers (for food, for conversation, for cigarettes, for companionship) is enough carry her through another day. —RL In a pivotal decade of Hindi cinema, one film towers above the rest: “Sholay.” Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 Western, penned by Salim-Javed, was initially panned and pegged as a flop, but a stark turn in fortune would soon put it on its path to legend. Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra star as Jai and Veeru, two petty criminals hired by former inspector Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) to catch the deadly bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) — alive. The duo’s friendship is the emotional core of a film filled with love, loss, and vengeance, with supporting performances by Hema Malini, A.K. Hangal, Jaya Bachchan, and more. Indian films love to experiment with tone and genre, but the confidence of “Sholay” set a golden standard. It starts as a buddy comedy filled with heists and hijinks, then slips into the sweet mundanity of village life with its rose-colored promises of the future. After Gabbar’s introduction, it goes full Western (but not without a ridiculous detour into Veeru’s love life). To watch “Sholay” is to be sublimely entertained — amused, shocked, charmed, moved, and everything in between — and captivated by a voracious kind of filmmaking that grows rarer by the day. Bachchan and Dharmendra’s magnificent duo drives the film, and also parallels the pairing of Kumar’s dignified resolve and Khan’s anarchic villainy. R.D. Burman’s soundtrack delivered nostalgic hits like “Yeh Dosti” and “Jab Tak Hai Jaan,” which drive the story rather than interrupt it, and Salim-Javed’s dialogue is quoted across India to this day. It’s extraordinary that “Sholay” became one of the most famous movies ever made, and all the more extraordinary that it earns every bit of its enduring popularity. —PK John Cassavetes, his wife Gena Rowlands, and his dear friend Peter Falk created a total explosion in 1974 with “A Woman Under the Influence,” which features some of the most searing and self-possessed screen acting of all time. Gena Rowlands’ turn as mentally anguished housewife Mabel Longhetti remains a peerless master class — an embodiment so soul-deep that it’s no exaggeration to suggest that it completely dissolves the barrier between performance and reality. But Falk holds his own as her husband Nick, who careens from serene — and sensitive to his wife’s condition — to throwdown impatience over her antics yet again, and again, and again. Originally, Rowlands and Cassavetes (who does not star in this film) envisioned “A Woman Under the Influence” as a stage play, but the intensity of Nick and Mabel’s emotional knockout fights — leading up to Mabel eventually being all but 5150ed — would surely have flattened Rowlands too greatly if she had to live it on stage multiple nights a week. Without studio backing, Cassavetes seemingly made the film with glue and paper clips, but you wouldn’t know that from the extraordinary control of craft on display, as much as “A Woman Under the Influence” doesn’t exactly present itself as a controlled film. It would be more accurate to describe it as a dizzyingly beautiful display of control being lost — of a free fall in motion. Some 50 years later we’re still waiting to hit the ground. —RL “Chinatown” is almost un-blurbable, and not only because it’s a film of such classical perfection in its Old Hollywood construction that its cavernous depths can only be fully appreciated with viewing after viewing after viewing. There’s the first viewing, where it’s easy to be taken in by its surface pleasures: John A. Alonzo’s nicotine-stain cinematography, Polanski’s apex-noir shot choices, Robert Towne’s seen-it-all dialogue, Jerry Goldsmith’s ominous lament for solo trumpet, little detective-movie touches like Gittes putting a pocket watch under a car tire to capture the time that someone’s peeled away, Faye Dunaway talking about the flaw in her iris. All of it is intoxicating. Then, maybe on the second viewing, you find yourself compelled to dig deeper into the real history of a city that literally stole its water from the poor farmers of Owens Valley in order to become “L.A.” — a city of hunger built on thirst. Only in the viewings after that do the full crepuscular depths of this film’s black beating heart fully pump their way into your own bloodstream. John Huston’s Noah Cross is immediately shocking and repellant, but it’s only with prolonged exposure that one begins to recognize how deeply the personal, sexual, and political violence Cross represents is part of the historical fabric of this country. The ultimate act of a city and a nation holding a mirror up to itself (as is usually best achieved by an outsider to both, one indelibly marked by tragedy himself in his temporary adopted country), “Chinatown” is really a mirror held up to a mirror, reflecting back a city and its dream reflections of itself over and over and over again. “Chinatown” is the famous shot of a million Charles Foster Kanes repeated to infinity in Xanadu’s mirrors as an entire feature. It’s Jimmy Stewart looking into the abyss off the bell-tower roof in “Vertigo.” It achieves that effect with a singularly devious subtlety. Chinatown” is an example of how true mastery always trumps virtuosity — restraint over flash, craft over spectacle. It’s a cinema that’s grown up, that doesn’t believe in the lies of its dreamtown or of the medium best associated with it, but finds those lies ever-intoxicating and irresistible nonetheless. And it always comes back for more. —CB Rainer Werner Fassbinder effortlessly took to science fiction in “World on a Wire,” reorienting his recurring use of reflective surfaces as a means of illustrating both surveillance-state dystopia and identity confusion over the simulation program that presents its wired-in residents a false reality. That this simulation exists not merely to produce more docile citizens, but also to act as a kind of aggressive consumer testing for capitalist interests, only further stresses the dehumanization of the premise. For all of its heady concepts, however, the film finds the director frequently cutting loose with ideas, using the excuse of a constructed reality to freely blend imagery of 20th-century Germany and pop culture. A timely disco rave rubs up against a Weimar-esque cabaret, and the soundtrack runs the gamut from a performance of Marlene Dietrich classic “The Boys in the Back Room” to Fleetwood Mac. This is one of Fassbinder’s most daring tribute/critiques of his nation’s addled and divided sense of self, at once at the cutting-edge of technology, economic growth, and culture but freighted by the immense burden of a history that lurks around every corner. —JC From the ashes of an aborted Napoleon film, Stanley Kubrick fashioned one of the most lushly beautiful movies ever made out of William Makepeace Thackeray’s picaresque novel about an Irish rogue who cons his way from lowly ruffian to nouveau riche nobility and back down again. Pioneering techniques for shooting in low-light and candlelit conditions, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott capture painterly landscapes worthy of Watteau and intensely detailed, densely populated interiors indebted to cheeky 18th century artist William Hogarth. Even the director’s usual icy mood and arch critical distance cannot preclude an immersive quality almost entirely unseen in period cinema to that point. Beneath the surface, though, “Barry Lyndon” is one of Kubrick’s funniest movies, wielding Ryan O’Neal’s prickly personality to reflect the way that Barry’s social-climbing schemes usually succeed through bullheaded stubbornness rather than adroit manipulation. Ryan O’Neal’s Barry is a loathsome boor who keeps failing upward, finding along the way that people at every rung of the hierarchy are equally petty and venal and differ only in their ability to dress up these flaws in politesse. —JC Djibril Diop Mambéty’s “Touki Bouki” is one of the most stylistically inventive films of the 1970s. Made on a shoestring budget in post-independence Senegal, it follows two young lovers as they scheme to escape Dakar for Paris. The film’s fragmented editing, layered sound, and erratic structure reflect the characters’ restless desire to leave — as well as their confusion about what leaving really means. Both home and destination are shaped by the same colonial past. A landmark of African cinema, “Touki Bouki” remains a singular, disillusioned portrait of youth caught between dreams and dislocation. —TO A smirking meditation on authenticity that profiles art forger Elmy de Hory, hoax biographer Clifford Irving, and Orson Welles’ Yugoslavian paramour Oja Kodar as part of an elaborate attempt to disguise its own trickery, “F for Fake” isn’t just cinema’s most playful self-portrait, it’s also its most dazzling statement of purpose. “Art is a lie that makes us see the truth,” Welles quotes Picasso as saying, and “F for Fake” offers an impossibly fitting gracenote to the career of an American titan whose work — from “The War of the Worlds” to “Citizen Kane” and beyond — hinged on the power of showmanship in a world all too eager to believe its own eyes. And ears. “For the next hour,” Welles proclaims in the first reel, “everything in this film will be based on solid fact.” But it’s the rest of time that “F for Fake” is most concerned with, and Welles’ fascination with charlatans, forgeries, and doublespeak indeed cuts deeper than ever at a time when we’re all at the mercy of our worst hucksters. To revisit this endlessly knotted Magic Eye puzzle of an essay film today is to appreciate that nothing has changed beyond the sloppiness of the world’s sleight-of-hand. As Welles says of Irving’s fraud: “It may well be the hoax of the century, but, really, this is not, you know, in any way the century of the hoax. We hanky-panky men have always been with you.” And they always will be. If only they took as much pleasure in it as Welles did. If only they gave so much of that pleasure back to us in return. —DE Released a year ahead of America’s bicentennial, Robert Altman’s panoramic view of celebrity and politics represents a high point of Altman’s experimental naturalism. Joan Tewkesbury’s script — or blueprint, given Altman’s tendency to improvise — splits the difference between New Journalism field reporting and biting social satire. The question of whether “Nashville” celebrates or condescends to the music and people of the eponymous setting still incites debates. The film’s poignant, downbeat ending recalls the political assassinations that dominated the previous decade and presages the shocking celebrity-based violence that would come to define the remainder of the century. As Altman’s film strenuously argues, everyone wants to be famous, no matter what the cost. We’re way past the point where identifying that celebrity and politics are two sides of the same coin can be considered a novel observation, but Altman never lectures the audience about the idea anyway. He merely integrates it into the infrastructure. The gap between unseen populist presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker, whose banal observations blare through the streets like hokey pabulum, and the aspiring singers that flit through the film’s margins is as thin as paper. Only Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), the fragile country singer constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown, seems to recognize that fame is merely a gateway to being used by friends and strangers alike. Like all great works, “Nashville” uses its narrow scope to probe at universal ideas—about the ways social environments breed and warp personal aspirations and how the proliferation of images permanently distorted reality. In one sense, “Nashville,” much like lothario singer Tom Frank, played by Keith Carradine, is easy, at least to describe in the abstract. But it’s much more difficult to explain the feeling of being immersed in its world. Altman and his players construct a lattice of pleasures and heartbreaks, vulnerable desires and duplicitous actions, local struggles and national wounds that rarely feel contrived or artificial. So much of the film feels like listening in on people’s lives, catching glimpses of their personalities as they move through the world, and projecting joy or sorrow onto their behavior. Altman allows his audience to get to know his characters, but he also keeps them at a crucial distance. It’s not unlike the experience of having a long chat with a stranger at a bar: you get to know them, but you will never perceive the full picture. This clash between familiar intimacy and fundamental unknowability at the heart of “Nashville” lends it a uniquely peerless quality. Fifty years later, It’s still one of a kind. —VM The first time you watch Nagisa Ōshima’s “In the Realm of the Senses,” it might seem like more of a horror movie than a love story. This is, after all, a claustrophobic — and broadly true — saga of erotic obsession from the most hostile of Japanese auteurs; a mad and scandalous work of art that’s full of unsimulated sex, peppered with a massacre’s worth of little deaths, and topped off with a scene of genital amputation so unflinching that it feels like an answer to the eyeball cut in Buñuel’s “Un Chien Andalou.” Even if you’re willing to consider that Abe Sada chops off Ishida Kichizō’s penis as an act of love and mutual liberation, it still hurts to watch. The most notorious and universal of Ōshima’s transgressions, “In the Realm of the Senses” has never been at risk of aging, but its carnal revolt against the rising tide of militarism has only become more relevant over the course of recent years, as has its naked and pungent reaction to the dangers of living in a country that’s ashamed of all the wrong stuff. “Love of a country is a strange thing,” Ōshima once said. “Just puffing out your chest with national pride and telling people how wonderful your country is does not constitute love of country as I see it. You have to tell the truth about your country, whatever it is.” Ōshima saw “In the Realm of the Senses” as a chance to seduce people into looking at themselves. It would be erotic but not titillating, arousing but not exploitative. It would offset the mucus, viscera, and verisimilitude of hardcore porn with the matter-of-factness of a nature documentary. In the end, it does all that and more. The film gradually becomes so cocooned inside its crust of dried sex that viewers start to get turned off just as they begin to realize there’s nowhere else for them to go. —DE A singularly crucial text in the myth of Werner Herzog, “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” endures as cinema’s most lucid (self)portrait of the madness that some men develop in response to the sheer poverty of their own power — in response to the hard fact that death is the only destiny that nature has put aside for them. It’s a film about how the hardness of that fact compels such men to invent a new destiny for themselves; how it gives them the will required to lead a suicide march in search of El Dorado, or in Herzog’s case the will to recreate one. The ecstatically true story of the 16th century conquistadors who splintered away from Gonzalo Pizarro’s expedition and disappeared into the Amazon rainforest, never to be seen again, “Aguirre” is steeped in a fever from its opening shots, which find the Spaniards forcing their slaves down through the clouds of the Urubamba Valley as if descending into heaven. The biblical drama of the Peruvian landscape is further exaggerated by the clinical disinterest Herzog takes in the the human folly he stages against it (a reflection of the apathy the jungle shows to us all), which is set to the novocaine-like numbness of Popol Vuh’s airy score, and unravels with the natural calm of river water floating downstream. Klaus Kinski’s feral performance as the demented Aguirre is all the more affecting for how it preserves that sense of calm amid his character’s increasingly grandiose delirium. The actor’s jagged face had long struck Herzog as the only human landscape that could fully convey the destructive indifference of nature itself, and here in the first of their violent and spectacular collaborations Kinski is so possessed by mad pride that he seems to wield the wrath of god to the same degree he suffers from it. Movie characters have never been more primitive, but in a film so cut to the bone — a film whose abject denial of poetry suffuses every scene with an inescapable unreality — Aguirre’s wide-eyed sense of purpose is no less divine than Herzog’s determination to capture it on camera. —DE Ridley Scott’s “Alien” (1979) didn’t just explode the sci-fi genre — it redefined what it meant to make a blockbuster with brains and blood. A haunting, slow-burn thriller with the visual sophistication of an art film and the unrelenting terror of a monster movie, “Alien” pushed the boundaries of genre cinema and delivered a protagonist who would go on to reshape the cinematic landscape: Ellen Ripley, played as only the brilliant Sigourney Weaver could. Weaver isn’t even the first name you see in the opening credits — that honor goes to Tom Skerritt — but by the time the credits roll, there’s no mistaking who this film belongs to. Ripley doesn’t start off as the obvious hero. She becomes one — forged in trauma, quick-thinking, and sheer will. Her emergence 45 minutes in, amid a cascade of terror, feels revolutionary even now. Scott’s decision to re-gender the lead (originally written as a man by screenwriter Dan O’Bannon) was a seismic move. In an era dominated by masculine action heroes — from “Apocalypse Now” to “Moonraker” — Ripley was a revelation: competent, logical, unshakably brave, but never stripped of her humanity. She doesn’t just survive the alien. She outwits it, outlasts it, and in doing so, becomes the rare kind of cinematic icon who actually earns her place in the pantheon. Weaver’s final showdown — flamethrower in hand, fear in her eyes — is the ultimate mic drop on a decade of genre excess. She saves the ship, the cat, herself, and maybe cinema itself. “Alien” isn’t just one of the best films of the ’70s. It’s a blueprint for how genre filmmaking can be smart, subversive, and unforgettable. Want the job done right? Send Ripley. Send “Alien.” —KE Francis Ford Coppola devotees — and Coppola himself — often like to describe “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” as one single, seamless film. But that well-intentioned praise falls short of capturing what Coppola actually accomplished with his sequel. After all, the only thing harder than making “The Godfather” might be embarking on a follow-up to an era-defining film that is universally agreed to have a perfect ending. Coppola had more resources at his disposal the second time around, but the expectations were infinitely higher as well. Nevertheless, he still found a way to deliver a movie that deepens the ideas established in its predecessor without resting on its laurels or undoing any of the magic. Rather than give audiences more of the same, Coppola dove head first into a bifurcated narrative structure that illustrates the way the Corleone family’s future is inextricably linked to its past. As Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone sinks his claws deeper and deeper into a life that his father never wanted for him, relative newcomer Robert De Niro fills the massive shoes left behind by Marlon Brando in an origin story that washes away all of the lies these mafiosos tell themselves about their line of work: At the end of the day it isn’t about family or survival, but a simple raw lust for power and revenge that can never be satisfied. “Part II” will never be quoted or referenced as much as its predecessor, and it’s slightly easier to walk away from if you happen to stumble on a half-finished basic cable broadcast while flipping channels. But what it sacrifices in montage-able moments, it more than makes up for with its textual depth. The first film is a straightforward gangster movie executed at the highest possible level, but the follow-up is a morality play of cosmic proportions. Coppola never shies away from Michael’s original reluctance to seize the throne or the downsides of the job, but “Part II” rips away every semblance of glamour and shreds the family structures that made Michael’s success possible until we’re forced to discard every interpretation except the reality that none of this was worth it. If “The Godfather” is the ultimate movie about a man who decides to sell his soul, “Part II” is just as definitive a portrait of what happens when the universe shows up to collect what it’s owed. —CZ It’s “The Godfather.” Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 masterpiece remains one of the definitive films of the ‘70s — a decade that stands for cinematic reinvention and a Hollywood-backed turn to more nuanced storytelling. More than just a “gangster movie,” it’s an operatic meditation on power, family, and corruption, wrapped in a mythic tale about the real price of the American Dream (read: pretty damn steep). And actors, boy, did we have actors back then. Marlon Brando’s unforgettable portrayal of Vito Corleone brought a weary, commanding presence to the screen, embodying the complex patriarch at the heart of this crime dynasty. Meanwhile, Al Pacino’s evolution from hesitant outsider to ruthless Mafia boss offers a masterclass in character transformation that fueled the film’s emotional core. Their performances, alongside one the best ensembles to ever be assembled on-screen, anchor a story that’s as intimate as it is epic. Coppola’s direction pairs perfectly with Gordon Willis’ iconic “shadow play” cinematography, creating a visual palette that feels both grand and suffocating — a world drenched in darkness and moral ambiguity. Nino Rota’s haunting score adds a layer of melancholy that lingers beyond the screen, turning every scene into something timeless. Even all these years on, few films have been able to so ably interrogate what it truly costs to succeed in America, exposing the price of loyalty, power, and legacy with unflinching honesty. Decades later, “The Godfather” remains a cultural touchstone, shaping not just the gangster genre but the very language of American cinema in the 1970s. It’s a film that captures the era’s restless spirit while standing as a timeless masterpiece. Not just one of the best films of the ‘70s, one of the best films of all time. We don’t see that changing any time soon. —KE Chantal Akerman’s anti-epic is a film composed of all the quotidian bits of life that are usually elided through editing, its construction foregrounding how the daily tasks we consider too boring for the silver screen are more often than not also traditionally viewed as “woman’s work.” Akerman captures every chore of Delphine Seyrig’s housewife in such excruciating detail that even her moonlighting sex work becomes just another line on the to-do list alongside preparing meals and cleaning. And yet, in its deliberate lack of incident, “Jeanne Dielman” slowly wrings tension out of the most banal variations on rigid schedules. A dropped utensil generates a jolt akin to Raymond Burr finally looking up into the camera in “Rear Window,” and a break in Jeanne’s tic of turning off the light when she leaves a room hints at a blurring of her separate lives as a housekeeper and sex worker. These infinitesimal discrepancies accumulate like chaotic fractals that prefigure an explosive finale that would feel abrupt and nonsensical without them but becomes a logical catharsis thanks to the subtle breadcrumb trail Akerman scatters over three hours. In its own way, “Jeanne Dielman” is as radical a synthesis of cinematic possibility as has ever been made, and one of the finest distillations of just how much can be communicated through blocking and precise editing over dialogue. —JC “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” has been seen as a cursed object since before it first premiered in the fall of 1975, three weeks after writer-director Pier Paolo Pasolini was tortured and then killed on a beach in Ostia; his murder remains unsolved in the strictest sense, but all signs point to the crime as an expression of the same fascistic impulse that his final film so fearlessly distills into its purest form. Immediately censored, widely banned, and so enduringly controversial that the likes of Alec Baldwin was compelled to defend its honor in a legal brief as recently as 2009, “Saló” has become synonymous with the extreme, the verboten, that which is beyond the bounds of good taste. Its title is a veritable shorthand for something difficult to stomach. And yet, to recognize that some people continue to be more perturbed by Pasolini’s film than they are by the pornographic cruelties of the world that inspired him to make it is to recognize why it was necessary for him to make it in the first place. Loosely adapted from the Marquis de Sade’s “The 120 Days of Sodom,” its 18th century debaucheries updated for the final days of the Mussolini regime, “Saló” tells the story of four ghoulish libertines who kidnap 18 teenagers, abscond to a remote mansion, and subject their innocent hostages to several months of extreme degradation. The youths are at the absolute mercy of their captors, who assume total control of their bodies across a series of dehumanizing rituals that begin with rape, progress to shit-eating, and ultimately climax in a mess of medieval barbarities. Vile enough on its face, Pasolini’s film is thoroughly suffused with the soullessness of its villains (particularly Aldo Valetti’s anus-obsessed “President,” whose crooked smile is more frightening than any of the tortures Pasolini’s cast had to fake for the camera); from Ennio Morricone’s jaunty opening tune to the upsetting symmetry of Pasolini’s compositions and the persistent sense of “fun” that stains even the worst of the horrors framed within, “Saló” insists on being received as a Dantean parody of the dictatorships and puppet states that destabilized so much of the 20th century, and continue to recur throughout history. “The one true anarchy is that of power,” the fanatical Duke proclaims, and “Saló” remains cinema’s most confrontational — and therefore most necessary — vision of the perverted chaos that autocrats seek to create under the guise of state control. —DE In the dying moments of the 1970s, Bob Fosse re-centered American cinema on the personal and hyper-subjective with “All That Jazz,” shattering the end of a decade whose movies had been fiercely preoccupied with the fractiousness of the social order. Here, in his penultimate film and greatest masterpiece, Fosse’s personal demons are on full, dazzling display, as the jazz dance legend electrifyingly fictionalized how his various addictions reached a fever pitch while editing “Lenny” at the same time as he tried to mount “Chicago” on Broadway. In doing so, Fosse’s diaristic hall of mirrors pushed the entire genre of movie musical itself into the self-reflexive headspace that it’s occupied ever since (as can be seen in everything from “Dancer in the Dark” to Annette” and, naturally, “Chicago”). “All That Jazz” blends fantasy and reality — memory and delusion — to create a celluloid autobiography that remains unparalleled for its raw emotional honesty and proximity to its subject, with Roy Scheider boldly and beautifully embodying Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon. He’s a chain-smoking, Dexedrine-popping, booze-guzzling workaholic, the kind of bottomless pit of a man who tells his girlfriend (played by Fosse’s protégé and real-life romantic partner Ann Reinking), when she says “I wish you weren’t so generous with your cock,” that he might like to use that line in a screenplay. “All That Jazz” also doubles as a sensational, shaggy backstage docudrama about the makings of Fosse’s song and dance — the script with its pierced venomous heart co-written by Robert Alan Aurthur, with Fosse choreographing the film himself. By the time Scheider is zipped up in a body bag at the movie’s end, having imagined the show of his own life in his head in his dying moments, it’s impossible not to feel winded by the experience of a wildly self-important spectacle that’s every inch as grand a portrait of an artist as “8 1/2,” “Andrei Rublev,” or “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.” “All That Jazz” is also the rare example of a movie musical that goes deeper than it could have on the stage, with Fosse utilizing the medium — at the height of his powers — with the reckless abandon of someone discovering it for the first time. It’s a movie that reflects all of the genius and unalloyed vision that had defined the previous decade in American film. And when Joe Gideon died, the ’70s died with him. —RL By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Good morning. Many of their colleagues were downsizing and preparing for their "empty nest" years. But one couple in their mid-40s moved in the opposite direction: they bought a bigger house. They don't always use the space, the cleaning is endless, and the bills are higher. A decade later, they're convinced they made the right decision. In today's big story, we all face an AI-supercharged job market. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, while hiring managers revealed how they're adapting to identify real talent. What's on deck: Markets: Are you struggling as a day trader? This psychologist might know why. Tech: It's not just Big Tech that's clamoring after AI engineers. Everyone wants to date them. Business: Like their customers, millennial-coded brands are facing the cold, hard reality of aging. But first, hand-delivered is hard to ignore. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Perhaps you did everything right. You spent hours researching the company. Hours more rewriting your résumé. The cover letter? Polished, professional, and personal. You click "submit." And wait. The days spin into weeks. The inbox never dings. You're not alone. White-collar hiring has slowed, layoffs feel de rigueur, and many who do have jobs are clinging onto them — whether they're happy or not. "My dream job might exist," a frustrated Gen Z job seeker told BI. "But I'm one of 400 people applying for it." The issue cuts both ways. For hiring managers, their dream employee might also exist. But amid a crowd of AI-generated applications, they may never find them. BI spoke with people on either side of the hiring divide. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, and employers revealed their strategies for spotting real talent. They're going old school. Job seekers are getting creative, with some finding success going back to basics: handing in a paper résumé in person. Businesses are adapting, too. With AI tools now helping with résumés, cover letters, and even live interviews, measuring a candidate's suitability for a role can be challenging. Is this the person we want to hire — or just the AI that coached them? Victoria Thomas, the chief business officer of a Porsche customization and racing company, said AI-crafted résumés can make candidates seem more qualified than they really are. To combat this, her team flies candidates to their Wisconsin office for in-person interviews and tryouts. The workplace is changing — and so are the rules for job searching. BI has tapped HR managers, recruiters, career coaches, and executives for their best advice on everything from crafting a standout résumé to networking your way to a final offer. So, before you send off that job application, you can find everything you need to gain an edge here. 1. Meet the 16-year-old prodigy at Citadel Securities. Kairan Quazi, a quant developer at the New York trading giant, caught the world's attention when he landed a job at SpaceX at age 14. He told BI why he switched from Big Tech to quant finance. 2. What makes (and breaks) a day trader? Andrew Menaker, a psychologist who coaches traders on and off Wall Street, has an answer. He said ego and aggression are traits that lead traders astray, and shared tips for those trying to get in on the trade. 3. Where to invest if the market goes south. If you're holding cash right now, it's a good idea to have a strategy for buying the dip in case a bear market hits. Two rules of thumb: Don't enter the market all at once, and don't panic. Here's where experts suggest investing. 1. In Silicon Valley, the ladies want a tech nerd. Professional matchmakers in the Bay Area — whose fees range from $5,900 to $500,000 — told BI more women are looking for AI engineers, thanks to their high salaries and job stability. It's not clear how long interest will last, but for now, the AI boom is making nerds sexy. 2. The startup turning Elon Musk's DOGE-fueled chaos into cash. Legalist, a startup founded by one of Peter Thiel's fellows, provides gap financing for vendors awaiting payouts from the federal government. Here's how they cashed in on the havoc DOGE wrecked. 3. How these Gen Zers beat the odds to score roles in tech. The industry is hemorrhaging entry-level jobs thanks to AI and corporate cost-cutting. Young workers told BI how they scored roles after casting a wide net or networking around the clock. 1. Millennial brands hit middle age. Glossier is at Sephora. Mideas are having holes drilled in them. What once seemed like an industry adjustment toward direct, values-centered relationships with consumers has been exposed as a marketing ploy — and today, these brands are either dying or becoming boring companies, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. 2. Spotify's ad business is laggy. Advertising made up 11% of its business in June, a far cry from its 20% target. "We have simply been moving too slowly," CEO Daniel Ek said on the company's latest earnings call. Industry insiders said poor customer service and low podcast ad rates were also factors. 3. The AT&T CEO's blunt memo is a test case for leaders. Since BI was the first to report on AT&T CEO John Stankey's viral memo to managers, hundreds of readers, including leaders, have weighed in. BI spoke to current and former CEOs for their thoughts on the memo. Three tips for employees to manage their wellbeing in a challenging job environment, from EY's Chief Wellbeing Officer.

US market dominance and Ethereum's impressive gains highlight the evolving crypto investment landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Digital asset investment products pulled in $3.75 billion in net inflows last week, marking one of the largest weekly gains in history, according to CoinShares latest weekly report. The renewed appetite follows several weeks of tepid market sentiment and coincides with a recent crypto price rally. Notably, these inflows lifted total assets under management (AuM) to a fresh record of $244 billion. Ethereum emerged as the clear leader in the market, drawing $2.87 billion in inflows, about 77% of the weekly total. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, noted that most of last week’s inflows concentrated in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum fund (ETHA), which accounted for over $2.3 billion of the fresh capital in the funds. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF and manages over $10 billion in assets, according to SoSo Value data. The BlackRock fund’s record performance has contributed significantly to ETH-focused funds’ accumulation of a record $11 billion in new capital this year. Conversely, Bitcoin-focused funds have repeatedly seen smaller flows in recent weeks, highlighting the shift in investor interest toward Ethereum. This was unchanged last week when the BTC-focused funds registered $522 million in new capital. Notably, CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum’s YTD inflows now represent 29% of its AuM, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the largest asset in terms of AuM, standing at $180.7 billion compared to Ethereum’s $37.7 billion. Meanwhile, short Bitcoin products saw $4 million in inflows as prices dipped below $120,000, triggering significant losses for leveraged long traders. Outside of the top two major cryptocurrencies, XRP and Solana continue to remain the top altcoin pick for institutional investors. Last week, funds focused on these digital assets registered over $300 million in combined fresh capital. This brings their year-to-date flows to over $2 billion, and their funds also manage more than $5 billion in assets. Regionally, the United States accounted for nearly all of the inflows, contributing $3.73 billion, around 99% of the total. Other markets recorded smaller gains, including Canada with $33.7 million, Hong Kong with $20.9 million, and Australia with $12.1 million. However, these gains were partially offset by outflows from Sweden and Brazil, which saw $49.9 million and $10.6 million withdrawn, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The TeX Factor For Traditional And Digital Asset Businesses

Time Published: 2025-08-18T13:00:00Z

ByJoshua D. Smeltzer ByJoshua D. Smeltzer, Contributor. Full disclosure, I’m an adopted Texan. I wasn’t born or raised in Texas, but my family and I moved from Washington, D.C. in 2007 and I have called it home ever since. Although this fact may, reasonably, color my views, it has been a remarkable place to watch economic growth and the adoption of the digital asset economy. In general, Texas has always been a business-friendly environment. However, a series of recent moves by Texas lawmakers shows a deliberate effort to establish a business and, specifically, a digital asset business destination. Texas has embraced digital asset innovation - Bitcoin mining, financial services, and Web3, as well as blockchain and associated other companies in this new and growing industry. Most recently, Texas established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin reserve which allows the investment of public funds into digital assets. As expected, this will be managed by the Texas Comptroller. This creates a very conducive environment for digital asset and other traditional companies. Another significant step in making Texas a catalyst for economic growth is the creation of the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) that intends to open in 2026. Texas is proving that southern hospitality extends not only to the people who visit, but to businesses as well. Full disclosure, again, I’m a litigator handling corporate, tax, white-collar, and other financial disputes. Although inherently disruptive, litigation is sometimes the only way for parties to resolve disputes and be able to carry on their respective business. Even with the best. Texas has legislated a two-phase approach: creating laws that will reduce disputes and also creating specific courts. The intention is to allow for a more streamlined approach to resolving complex business disputes outside of the regular state court system. On May 14, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 into law that immediately became effective. The legislation codified the “business judgment rule” which created a presumption that the directors and officers of corporations acted in good faith, on an informed basis, in furtherance of the interests of the corporation, and in obedience to the law and the corporation’s governing documents when taking action on matters of the corporation’s business. In order to establish a cause of action the corporation or its shareholders must rebut these presumptions and prove a breach of their duties involving fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act (i.e. outside scope of powers), or a knowing violation of law. Senate Bill 29 also codified the right of a Texas entity to include a provision in its operating documents waiving a right to a jury for any “internal entity claims.” In a new and developing industry, especially one based on new technologies like Distributed Ledger Technology and other technology related to digital assets, directors and officer are more likely to exercise “business judgment” on how to operate and grow the company. If that judgment is subject to easy lawsuits second-guessing hard choices, or using hindsight analysis, it can hold back innovative decision-making or paralyze a growing company while it waits for lengthy litigation to conclude. The new law allows the governing documents to require that internal entity claims be brought in Texas courts, including the newly established Texas Business Courts. The Texas Business Court is a statewide, specialized trial court created to resolve certain complex business disputes. The Texas Business Courts opened on September 1, 2024 with the judges appointed by the governor for a two-year term (instead of elected). The law required that these judges must have had at least 10 years of practice in civil business litigation, business transaction law, or service as a civil judge. The new courts have limited jurisdiction (e.g. larger amounts in controversy, specific issues such as corporate governance, etc.) which means a smaller docket of cases and the presumption of faster resolution. Since the business courts are still relatively new, it will take time to determine exactly what types of business disputes benefit from this specialization. All eyes are on Texas to determine if time is saved by the smaller, more specialized, caseload. Backed by financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has the funding to create a pro-business, innovation-friendly alternative to traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. TXSE is, of course, focused on traditional financial products but has the opportunity to differentiate itself as a digital asset focused exchange. BlackRock runs popular Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the presumption that similar products will be offered on TXSE. Also, publicly traded companies involved in Bitcoin mining are already available on other exchanges. For examples, popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global was recently added to the S&P 500. Circle Internet Group, a stablecoin market leader, recently applied to establish a national trust bank in anticipation of meeting requirements under recent stablecoin legislation to integrate digital assets into the broader financial system. Today, there is a lot of movement in traditional equity markets to incorporate digital asset financial products. This is happening just as a new national stock exchange, TXSE, is seeking to provide an alternative to traditional platforms. Thus, TXSE has the greatest opportunity to truly integrate both digital asset and traditional markets since it starts with a cleaner slate than the older established stock exchanges. Texas wasn’t the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, but its version did go a little further than similar legislation. The first such law was incorporated in New Hampshire, but did not that state’s reserve to be funded by public dollars. However, on June 20, 2025, Senate Bill 21, created the state-managed Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This legislation outlines the intent to use the digital asset reserve as a financial buffer, hedging against inflation and economic volatility. The Texas Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by airdrops, legislative appropriations, revenue dedicated by general law, cryptocurrencies acquired through forks, and investment earnings or rewards. This is a significant difference, since Texas has decided to put its own money at risk as a sign to digital asset companies that it is willing to take the same risks on this new asset and industry. At the federal level, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also indicated a willingness to potentially “acquire more Bitcoin" to increase the United States’ Bitcoin reserve. Texas is one of the largest economies in the world, and it has already committed to invest in Bitcoin as a method of protecting the finances for its citizens. That is unique among other government institutions - at least for now. When I first moved from Washington, D.C. to Texas, I was a bit concerned that my east coast personality might not mesh well with the local culture. However, the cliche’ of southern hospitality has proven true, both personally and professionally. I’ve watched the same welcoming attitude apply to many businesses that have decided to also make Texas their adopted homes. This has included many digital asset and blockchain based companies during a time when it was not as mainstream to be operating those types of ventures. In the best adopted Texan spirit I can muster - Y’all should come and check out Texas.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard's Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will "redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives." Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as "a blueprint for a hope-filled future," while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could "ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most." Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, "Heroic Accounting," we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting's core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an "extremely high" risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI's methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world's poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues "We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits." But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager's employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI's approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm's measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country's robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania's low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI's method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. "Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous," write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. "Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment." Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, "Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, 'It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.'" Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian's wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don't need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as BlackRock’s CEO Takes Helm at World Economic Forum

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, turned one of the world’s leading financial institutions into a crypto powerhouse. What Michael Saylor and (Micro)Strategy did for Bitcoin treasuries, Fink did for ETFs: And now that Fink has been appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) – serving alongside Roche’s André Hoffmann – what’s next? Will the WEF take a more explicitly pro-crypto stance? And if so, which are the cryptos best-positioned for explosive growth? Fink’s appointment arrives just as WEF closed an internal investigation that found no material wrongdoing by founder Klaus Schwab. The WEF framed the move as part of a reset to ‘strengthen the organization.’ For their part, Fink and Hoffmann emphasized revitalizing public-private cooperation in a ‘fragmented’ world. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. —Fink and Hoffman, Statement from Interim Co-Chairs of WEF For crypto, the headline isn’t just who chairs WEF – it’s that the leading gatekeeper of institutional crypto exposure now has a formal hand on one of the world’s most influential finance convening platforms. Because BlackRock dominates spot crypto ETFs with iShares Bitcoin Trust ($IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ($ETHA), it controls real, regulated pipes through which pensions, RIAs, corporates and sovereigns can touch $BTC and $ETH at size. Just last week, Ether ETFs saw record single-day inflows (topping $1.02B), with BlackRock’s ETHA capturing $640M in one session. Earlier this summer, IBIT’s held coins crossed 700K BTC, further illustrating its market heft. Its $BUIDL fund – tokenized U.S. dollar liquidity issued on Ethereum – launched in March 2024, surpassed $1B AUM by March 2025, and later expanded share classes across multiple chains. $BUIDL forms a practical bridge between on-chain finance and institutional balance sheets. Crucially, WEF already runs programs that touch digital assets, like the Digital Currency Governance Consortium (DCGC), and the Crypto Sustainability Coalition. The programs launched between 2021-2022, but have fallen quiet in recent days. What’s the likely outcome? Probably not a single policy edict – Fink spoke in only general terms in his statement – but a faster convergence around best practices for custody, market data, disclosures, and interoperability. Those are all areas where BlackRock possesses both operating experience and great success, and which can translate into global templates. And with Fink at the helm of the WEF, look for these three projects to quickly become some of the best crypto to buy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers a faster-than-ever Bitcoin experience. How? By combining Bitcoin’s original Layer 1 with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The result is a lightning-fast Layer 2 that leverages the SVM’s transaction speeds and smart contract execution – but keeps final transaction settlement on Bitcoin. When it comes to Bitcoin itself, $BTC tokens are deposited into the Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and emerge on the Hyper Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. There, your $BTC can be staked, deployed in liquidity pools, used in DeFi operations, and more as the case may be. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide, and don’t miss out on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction; we think $HYPER could reach $0.32 by the end of the year, up 2,415% from its current $0.012745. The presale is already well over $10.3M raised. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more. Web3 wallets are rapidly becoming far more than simply places to store your crypto; they’re the gateways to a whole new world of DeFi and crypto tools. And non-custodial wallets – where you control your own private keys – are critical, as a new wave of crypto users learns the truth of one of crypto’s founding principles: Best Wallet is a non-custodial wallet with some truly innovative features. In addition to swapping, sending, and storing your crypto, Best Wallet users can access and purchase promising top presales. Find whitepapers and tokenomics, browse new meme coins, and purchase tokens – all from within Best Wallet. And the $BEST token is key of this growing Best Wallet economy. Hold $BEST and gain lower trading fees and better staking rewards within Best Wallet. During the presale, you can stake $BEST for an additional 90% APY — learn how to buy $BEST here. What is $BEST, if not the best utility token for the Best Wallet? Our price prediction is also bullish, seeing a chance for the token to reach $0.072 by the end of 2025, up 182% from its current level of $0.025495. Check out the Best Wallet Token presale now. The crypto ecosystem is, as Fink pointed out, fragmented. Chainlink ($LINK) helps bind it together. Blockchain oracles feed real-world-data into the blockchain, allowing smart contracts to execute correctly based on price points, timestamps, and more. But Chainlink has grown beyond a simple oracle network. It’s a web that binds blockchains and TradFi together. It also secures data, offers cross-chain interoperability and decentralized computations to enable finance to operate on-chain, and blockchains to access financial networks. Chainlink notable partners include: On the token side, $LINK is the network’s utility token. Revenue from on-chain and off-chain operations has provided a hefty reserve: $LINK’s performance has been impressive as well, up 143% in the past year. Implementing fundamental changes to the world economic order requires far more than simply an interim head of the WEF. Real change will still flow through the SEC, ESMA, FCA, MAS, and countless other agencies. But Fink’s appointment, combined with IBIT/ETHA’s scale, record ETF flows, and BlackRock’s tokenization push, could make him nudge the global conversation toward treating crypto as core market infrastructure, instead of a side bet. If that happens, look for $LINK (oracle networks), $BEST (non-custodial wallet token), and $HYPER (cutting-edge Bitcoin Layer 2) to be among the next crypto to explode.

Title: Tokenized assets near $300 billion as Wall Street quietly floods on chain

Stablecoins dominate at $267 billion while tokenized Treasuries climb past $7 billion. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized assets recorded on public blockchains have reached approximately $293 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. The figure, which includes stablecoins valued at about $266.7 billion, places tokenization near the $300 billion threshold, emphasizing its role as a structural layer in on-chain financial markets. Excluding stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets account for around $26.3 billion. The growth of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has emerged as a defining feature of this market. The segment surpassed $5 billion in March and now measures close to $7.3 billion in outstanding value. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents the largest share, with roughly $2.4 billion, followed by Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, at about $700 million, while Ondo’s OUSG and other vehicles, including USYC, JTRSY, and USTB, round out the leading issuers. This movement of short-term debt on the chain has accelerated in a high-interest-rate environment, drawing capital toward tokenized money-market funds and Treasury products. Tokenized Treasury and money-market mutual fund assets rose nearly 80% year to date, reaching $7.4 billion by mid-summer. Market participants increasingly use these products for yield capture and settlement efficiency, with institutional issuers anchoring adoption. Integrating BlackRock and Franklin into on-chain infrastructure illustrates how traditional finance firms use tokenization for capital markets operations beyond pilot programs. These tokenized funds function as yield-bearing stablecoin alternatives, attracting capital that may otherwise remain in non-interest-bearing stablecoin formats. Stablecoins continue to dominate the landscape with nearly $267 billion in value and more than 189 million holders globally, according to RWA.xyz. The sector remains the entry point to tokenized finance while indirectly supporting the Treasury market through reserve allocations. The scale of stablecoin holdings has created a structural bid in short-term U.S. government securities, reinforcing their connection to traditional financial markets. This demand channel links on-chain activity to systemic funding markets and elevates the policy considerations surrounding stablecoin regulation. The diversification of tokenized assets beyond stablecoins highlights further adoption. Data shows smaller but steady issuance across private credit, institutional funds, commodities, and corporate debt instruments. While Ethereum holds more than half of the non-stablecoin RWA share, networks such as ZKsync, Solana, Stellar, and Aptos are capturing portions of issuance, reflecting the infrastructure spread. These developments suggest tokenization is functioning as both a settlement infrastructure and a means of structuring regulated financial products on public ledgers. Institutional entry has been accompanied by exploration from banks and custodians, with settlement portability and collateral efficiency identified as primary drivers. While not all initiatives occur on public blockchains, the continued development of tokenized rails illustrates how traditional finance and crypto-native products are converging around the same operational mechanisms. The distinction between stablecoins as transactional units and tokenized funds as yield-generating products will remain central to how investors allocate across these categories. Tokenized assets approaching $300 billion marks a transition from concept to operating infrastructure. The scale now reflects not only retail payments through stablecoins but also institutionally managed capital in regulated securities, suggesting that tokenization is already a live component of global financial plumbing rather than a speculative frontier.

August 18, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Alkane Resources Limited Alkane Resources Limited PERTH, Australia, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As originally indicated in an investor announcement dated 14 August 2025, Alkane Resources Limited (ASX: ALK; TSX: ALK; OTCQX: ALKEF) is pleased to provide the latest exploration results for drilling in the region around the Company’s Tomingley Gold Operations in Central New South Wales: Alkane Managing Director & CEO, Nic Earner, said: “We continue to explore at Tomingley within our approved mining areas and regionally, seeking to add further mine life, scale, and grade to Tomingley. It is pleasing to see the extent of mineralisation in the broader Tomingley region, and we look forward to continuing to add to our resource base.” Tomingley Gold Project Alkane Resources Ltd 100% The Tomingley Gold Project (TGP) covers an area of approximately 440 km2 stretching 60 km north-south along the Newell Highway from Tomingley in the north, through Peak Hill and almost to Parkes in the south. The TGP contains Alkane’s currently operating TGO, an open pit and underground operation with a 1 Mtpa processing facility. Over the past several years Alkane has conducted an extensive regional exploration program that led to the definition of Mineral Resources at the Roswell and San Antonio deposits (ASX Announcement 2 May 2022 and ASX Announcement 16 February 2021), separate from the established resources and reserves at TGO. Alkane has completed a 2.7 km long drive from the Wyoming One open cut to Roswell. Roswell and San Antonio now form part of TGO, with processing of ore mined from underground at Roswell beginning in April 2024. The focus for the exploration team has turned to other targets within the TGP, both near-mine and further out from TGO. Exploration over the previous 12 months for TGP comprised high-resolution drone magnetics, air-core drilling testing the Mingelo Volcanic belt between El Paso prospect and Peak Hill, and deeper RC/DD drilling testing El Paso, Tomingley Structure, and the historic Tomingley workings that are all located within 7 km of the Tomingley processing facility. As part of the recent exploration drilling, assay results were received from 233 air-core (AC) drill holes for a total of 16,693 metres; 6 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes for a total of 1,442 metres; and 6 diamond core (DD) drill holes for a total of 1,883 metres. The exploration undertaken: El Paso The El Paso prospect is ~2 km south of the San Antonio deposit (406,000 oz Au * details in appended table). Mineralisation associated with attenuated volcanic units was discovered at this prospect in 2017. Several programs of drilling intersected multiple zones of mineralisation, however the complexity of the geology, the widespread alteration and difficult drilling conditions has so far impeded the effective delineation of substantial gold resources. Four mud rotary collared DD holes were recently completed to further test significant gold mineralisation associated with a dacite volcanic unit intersected in the previous round of drilling by EPD013 – 12 m @ 1.50 g/t Au from 297 m (ASX announcement 7 October 2024). Significant gold mineralisation includes intercepts that are approximately true thickness (estimated at 90%): The dacite has a northeast strike length of over 400m, dips to the southeast and appears truncated by a subvertical north-trending shear zone along strike and down dip to the east. The dacite is believed to continue at depth to the south (west of the shear zone).The mineralisation appears to continue down dip (across the shear zone) within the volcaniclastic sediments, as a possible conduit structure to the mineralisation hosted in the dacite. A further 2,000m of mud rotary diamond core drilling is planned to begin in September to contribute to defining an exploration target for El Paso. One RC drill hole was planned to test an Au-As zone of mineralisation previously intersected by three AC drill holes, 1 km southeast of El Paso (ASX announcement 7 October 2024). Unfortunately, the RC drill hole failed to overcome the sandy alluvial overburden and underlying saprolitic regolith, terminating in gold mineralised bedrock at 124m, grading 0.22 g/t Au. Mud rotary diamond drilling is being prioritised to test this new prospect properly. EPD017 – Sericite-carbonate altered dacite with sheeted quartz-albite veins and pyrite-arsenopyrite selvages from 6.1m interval grading 3.03 g/t Au from 120.9 m. Tomingley Structure prospects The ‘Tomingley Structure’ is an Au-As mineralised structure that extends north 5km from the historic Tomingley workings and transects the Tomingley Two prospect. The Tomingley Structure was originally delineated by reconnaissance air-core drilling north of Tomingley and identified the Tomingley One and Tomingley Two prospects (ASX announcement 8 June 2004). Mineralisation associated with the structure comprises strong quartz veining/silicification and intense sericite alteration with pyrite-arsenopyrite hosted in meta-sediments. The structure is covered by shallow alluvium immediately south of the historic Tomingley workings, deepening to approximately 30 metres at Tomingley One and to over 100 metres north of Tomingley Two. Five RC drill holes for a total of 1,318 metres tested along the ‘Tomingley Structure’. Significant gold (+0.2 g/t Au) was intersected in three holes and in addition significant arsenic (+0.1 % As) was intersected in a fourth hole. The fifth RC hole did not reach target depth due to sandy alluvium bogging the rod string, terminating the hole at 148 metres. Significant gold mineralisation from the drilling includes: Work is planned at Tomingley One (e.g. TO035 – 2m @ 10.9g/t Au from 34m; ASX announcement 8 June 2004) and Tomingley Two (e.g. TORC005 – 11m @ 1.7 g/t Au from 158m including 4m @ 3.87 g/t Au from 159m; ASX announcement 16 September 2021) prospects to better characterise the structures and lithologies integral for significant gold mineralisation. Two diamond core drill holes are planned, to collect structural measurements and to define any key lithologies focussing mineralisation. Tomingley Gold Workings and near-mine exploration Two diamond core holes were completed from surface to test near-mine targets immediately north of the mining lease. Diamond hole (PATD002) targeted 600m north of the Caloma open cut to test for an extension to the andesite that hosts the majority of the Caloma gold resources (pre-mining Caloma resource 369,400 oz Au – ASX announcement 29 March 2012). The hole intersected a package of carbonaceous shales, fine-grained volcaniclastic sediments and the Caloma andesite with an estimated true thickness of 60 metres (similar thickness as observed at Caloma). Mineralised quartz veining was observed in the footwall sediments to the andesite with a best intercept of: PATD002 5 metres grading 0.44g/t Au from 80.3 metres. Whilst only minor alteration and mineralisation was observed in the andesite, PATD002 was collared to the southwest which is not optimal for targeting Caloma’s moderately west-dipping mineralisation. Further drilling in planned to target this prospective lithology with diamond drill holes collared to the east, from the west side of the Newell Highway. The historic Tomingley gold workings were targeted for the first time in Alkane’s history, with one diamond core hole (PATD001). The workings (Crowhurst & Sons Mine – 62kg Au production 1883-1911) are an estimated 117m deep, PATD001 was targeted 30 metres below this depth. The drilling intersected a package of carbonaceous shales and volcaniclastic siltstones that was host to a 30-m-thick quartz reef with significant pyrite (and trace arsenopyrite) mineralisation. The quartz reef below the workings returned a best intercept of: PATD001 9.5 metres grading 0.27 g/t Au from 175.5 metres. The historic average head grade at Crowhurst is recorded as 26 g/t Au, so there are likely strong plunge controls to any high-grade ore shoots. Structural work is underway to determine an orientation for the existence of these shoots prior to further drill-testing. Reconnaissance AC drilling 233 air-core drill holes were completed for 16,693 metres along nominal 800 m-spaced traverses to test an approximate 2 km x 7 km section of the Mingelo Volcanic Belt between El Paso prospect and Peak Hill. The section of the belt is blind, covered by alluvium ranging from only a few metres to over 50 metres. Three potential new zones of mineralisation were discovered: Southeast of El Paso – Two holes (EPAC213 - 4) intersected Au-As mineralisation in weathered basaltic andesite, approximately 1 km southeast of El Paso, and 400 m southwest of previously AC defined Au-As mineralisation.This apparent northeast mineralisation trend parallels the orientation observed at El Paso. Significant Au-As anomalism was also intersected (EPAC201 – 2, JNAC042) along the eastern margin for 800 m of the extensive basaltic-andesite unit. Best Au intercepts include: Westray – Two holes (WSAC092, 94) intersected significant Au-As anomalism in volcaniclastic sediments proximal to andesites. Best Au intercepts include: Two deeper RC or DD drill holes are planned to test the coincident AC and soils Au-As target at Westray and the El Paso SE prospect. Planned exploration program Planned exploration around the Tomingley Gold Operations (TGO) for the next 12 months comprises a high-resolution drone magnetic survey over the area surrounding and including Peak Hill to delineate fertile structures and to map new volcanic terrain beneath the cover sequence to the east of Peak Hill. Other exploration involves work at numerous prospects, including 6,000m of deeper RC/DD drilling, comprising: El Paso, El Paso SE, Tomingley One, Tomingley Two, Caloma North (orogenic Au) – diamond drilling; Glen Isla (epithermal Au) – mapping, induced polarisation (IP) survey and diamond drilling; Westray (orogenic Au) – RC drilling; Reconnaissance, McGregors (orogenic Au) – air-core drilling; Gundong (magmatic Ni, orogenic Au) – air-core drilling; Trewilga (orogenic Au) – soil sampling. In parallel with routine grade control surface drilling at the planned San Antonio open cuts and underground drilling at Roswell underground, a significant underground drilling program is testing McLeans, Roswell North and the Roswell Western Monzodiorite. These results are anticipated in October. * hole finished in mineralisation. ** hole abandoned early. True widths are approximately 90% (El Paso) and 60% (Tomingley Two and Tomingley Workings) of intercept width.

Oracle has cut over 300 roles in the US When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings have confirmed Oracle has laid off over 300 workers in Washington and California. The redundancies consist of 143 workers in Redwood City, California and a further 161 in Seattle, Washington, however further layoffs could also be taking place that are not covered by WARN filings. A worker familiar with the matter told The Register the figures sound low, suggesting remote workers might not be accounted for – a way of obscuring the scale of layoffs that Microsoft has also been accused of. "It feels like that happened here too, the reported numbers don't quite match up with what my network is saying," the worker said. "My estimate would be low thousands worldwide... Supposedly this is just the start, too," they added. Compared with other giants in this space, Oracle's reaction to economic uncertainties has been pretty reserved. Around 200 workers left in 2022, with some more leaving in separate sittings since then. Compared with the tens of thousands who have lost their jobs at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Oracle workers have therefore been pretty safe. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Looking ahead, The Register's source suggests thousands could lose their jobs worldwide with offices being closed and large cuts in India (around 10% of its local workforce). Artificial intelligence has been blamed for ongoing tech layoffs, but instead of AI taking human jobs, companies are having to allocate more capital towards AI data center expansions, effectively cutting their staffing budgets. In June, Oracle confirmed a revenue increase for fiscal 2025 of 8%. "Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26," CEO Safra Catz noted. TechRadar Pro has asked Oracle to share further context about its recent layoffs. Any update will be posted here.

Title: Pop culture and politics are intertwined in the age of Trump. Just look at the Paramount-Skydance merger

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. My first job in the U.S. included covering Martha Stewart and World Wrestling Entertainment during the dot-com boom. Stewart was a multimedia influencer and doyenne of domesticity; Vince and Linda McMahon had transformed wrestling from a traveling circus of showmen and athletes into a superstar-studded global entertainment phenomenon. Today’s “trad wife” phenomenon or “manosphere” populated by the likes of Joe Rogan are not without precedent. Pop culture always reflects and responds to trends in the political sphere, and vice versa. What’s unusual, perhaps, is the degree to which the two worlds have become intertwined. It helps that Trump comes from that world, having spent several years in reality TV and most of his adult life as a media celebrity. Along with installing himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, President Trump personally picked this year’s list of honorees, which includes Kiss and Sylvester Stallone, and will host what he promises to be an ‘anti-woke’ ceremony. Few CEOs are more attuned to the political winds in Hollywood right now than David Ellison, the new CEO of Paramount following Skydance Media’s merger with Paramount Global earlier this month. To get the deal done, Skydance agreed to “address bias and restore fact-based reporting,” according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and appoint an ombudsman to address any concerns about bias. Paramount had also reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris prior to the deal getting done. In one of his first moves as head of the combined Paramount, Ellison last week announced a $7.7 billion agreement to air Ultimate Fighting Championship events over the next seven years. That’s no doubt a smart business decision and certainly not lost on Ellison that UFC is a Trump-friendly form of entertainment, as well as a “global sports powerhouse.” UFC CEO Dana White said Ellison negotiated an “all-or-nothing” deal. White is close to Trump, who recently said he’d love to stage a UFC match on the White House lawn. (White also recently joined Meta’s board, too.) Ellison, meanwhile, also struck a multi-year partnership with Taylor Sheridan, the creative mind behind “Yellowstone” and various spinoffs that are popular with conservative audiences. To grow beyond the $30+ billion it made last year, Paramount will need to appeal to a wide and varied demographic. While its cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” sparked accusations of pro-Trump bias, Paramount’s recent $1.5 billion streaming deal with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone suggests that Ellison understands the power of polarizing entertainment on both sides of the house. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Zelenskyy goes to DC… Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington DC today, joined by European leaders including European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. The meeting follows an inconclusive meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. On social media, Trump ruled out Ukraine joining NATO, or getting back Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. …and China's top diplomat goes to Delhi Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in India for a trip aimed at repairing a relationship that’s been cool since deadly border clashes in 2020. The dispute has hurt trade and investment between the two Asian economic powers. Both countries also face steep U.S. tariffs: Trump’s decision to slap 50% tariffs on India now threatens a broader strategy to make the South Asian country an alternative to China. IgniteTech’s AI-induced layoffs Software developer IgniteTech laid off nearly 80% of its employees within a year to make way for generative AI. CEO Eric Vaughan tells Fortune that he’d do it again: “It was extremely difficult … But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” Powell to speak on Friday Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will give an indication of whether rate cuts will resume next month in a speech on Friday. Some analysts think Powell will keep his cards close to his chest—and may not cut rates in September at all, despite Wall Street hopes of easing. Can OpenAI stay in front? OpenAI’s industry-leading position could be vulnerable, thanks to an underwhelming release of GPT-5 and new open-source challengers like China’s DeepSeek.

Title: Buy Nvidia Stock Ahead of Earnings?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/18/buy-nvidia-stock-ahead-of-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T09:00:16Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to announce its Q2 2026 earnings at the end of August (January fiscal year). Analysts anticipate earnings of $1 per share, an increase from $0.68 in the same quarter last year, and revenues are projected to grow by over 50% year-over-year to $45.60 billion. This growth is likely to be fueled by the sustained strong demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. Nvidia has been increasing large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, with their cutting-edge AI functionalities and premium pricing, may assist in driving revenue growth during Q2 FY’26, while also enhancing margins. Historically, NVDA stock has tended to outperform following earnings releases, having risen 60% of the time with a median one-day increase of 4.5% and a maximum observed increase of 24%. The company holds a current market capitalization of $4.4 trillion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $149 billion, and it was operationally profitable, achieving $86 billion in operating profits and a net income of $77 billion. Although much will depend on how results compare to consensus expectations, recognizing historical trends may improve your chances if you are an event-driven trader. Should you Buy Or Fear Nvidia stock? For event-driven traders, historical trends might provide an advantage, whether by positioning prior to earnings or responding to post-release movements. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than that of individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively less risky strategy (although not useful if the correlation is low) is to assess the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader could position themselves “long” for the upcoming 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the association between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. Occasionally, peer performance can impact post-earnings stock reactions. Indeed, the pricing-in may start before the earnings announcements are made. Here is some historical data illustrating the past post-earnings performance of NVIDIA stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings immediately before NVIDIA.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.” — Richard Feynman Number of the Week: 93% pre-industrial? THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with the highlights of Andrew Bolt’s interview of Steven Koonin then continues with a discussion of key issues in the report by the Climate Working Group to the Secretary of Energy. TWTW concludes with a discussion of increasing greenhouse gases today. ********************* Koonin Interviews: John Robson posted his long interview of Steven Koonin on Climate Change Nexus. Also, Paul Homewood posted an interview of Koonin by Andrew Bolt. Koonin is one of the five independent scientists who participated in the Climate Working Group that produced special report prepared for the US Department of Energy (DOE) titled ‘A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.’ Koonin was formerly Obama’s Under Secretary for Science, Department of Energy: The Bolt interview is short and succinct. Among the key points Koonin made are: TWTW has reviewed independent comments from three of the five scientists comprising the Climate Working Group concerning their report. Thus far, there appears to be no comments from John Christy or Ross McKitrick. No one has suggested that anyone in the Department of Energy interfered with the preparation or publication of the report. As the preface of the report states: ‘This document originated in late March 2025 when Secretary Wright assembled an independent group to write a report on issues in climate science relevant for energy policymaking, including evidence and perspectives that challenge the mainstream consensus. We agreed to undertake the work on the condition that there would be no editorial oversight by the Secretary, the Department of Energy, or any other government personnel. This condition has been honored throughout the process, and the writing team has worked with full independence.’[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Review of the Climate Working Group Report (Part 1): The body of “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate” opens with: ‘Part I: Direct Human Influence On Ecosystems and the Climate I Carbon Dioxide as a Pollutant Chapter summary: Carbon dioxide (CO2) differs in many ways from the so-called Criteria Air Pollutants. It does not affect local air quality and has no human toxicological implications at ambient levels. It is an issue of concern because of its effects on the global climate.’ After discussing the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the six so-called Criteria Air Contaminants subject to EPA regulation the chapter concludes with: ‘Ambient outdoor air today contains about 430 parts per million (ppm) CO2, increasing at about 2 ppm per year. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration issues guidelines for indoor workplaces in which elevated CO2 might be encountered, such as where dry ice is used. The Permissible Exposure Limit is 5,000 ppm over 8 hours (OSHA, 2024). Allen et al. (2015) reported evidence of diminished performance on some cognitive tasks among workers in office cubicles when exposed to CO2 levels above 1,000-1,500 ppm. These levels are far larger than any plausible ambient outdoor value through the end of the 22nd century. The growing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere directly influences the earth system by promoting plant growth (global greening), thereby enhancing agricultural yields, and by neutralizing ocean alkalinity. But the primary concern about CO2 is its role as a greenhouse gas (GHG) that alters the earth’s energy balance, warming the planet. How the climate will respond to that influence is a complex question that will occupy much of this report.’ [Boldface added] The next chapter starts with: ‘2 Direct Impacts of CO2 on the Environment Chapter summary: CO2 enhances photosynthesis and improves plant water use efficiency, thereby promoting plant growth. Global greening is due in part to increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere is well-established on all continents. CO2 absorption in sea water makes the oceans less alkaline. The recent decline in pH is within the range of natural variability on millennial time scales. Most ocean life evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic. Decreasing pH might adversely affect corals, although the Australian Great Barrier Reef has shown considerable growth in recent years. TWTW is uncertain about the statement “Most ocean life evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic” with a pH slightly below 7. Most ocean life may have may have evolved with a pH slightly above 7, mildly alkaline. But this is a minor point of uncertainty, not a contention. The chapter continues with: 2.1 CO2 as a contributor to global greening The growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has the important positive effect of promoting plant growth by enhancing photosynthesis and improving water use efficiency. That is evident in the ‘global greening’ phenomenon discussed below, as well as in the improving agricultural yields discussed in Chapter 10. Here we focus just on CO2 fertilization; research on combined effects due to temperature and precipitation changes are discussed in Chapter 10. 2.1.1 Measurement of global greening ‘Greening’ refers to an increase in the fraction of the Earth’s surface covered by plants. It can be quantified by the ‘Leaf Area Index’ (LAI) measured by satellite. Many studies over the past decade have confirmed a global greening pattern (increase in LAI) attributable in part to rising CO2 levels. Zhu et al. (2016) was one of the first studies to report that global greening was detectable using satellite sensors. From 1982 to 2011 they detected greening over 25-50 percent of the Earth versus ‘browning’ over only four percent and attributed 70 percent of the greening to rising CO2 levels (see Figure 2.1). Other contributors included land-use changes, warming and nitrogen. The fraction attributable to CO2 was largest in the tropics; other factors played more dominant roles in CONUS.’ Here we see the tremendous difference between this report and the UN IPCC and US National Climate Assessment reports. Reports on the effects of CO2 that ignore the importance of global greening have major omissions that are a form of “cherry picking” leading to highly biased conclusions. As the Climate Working Group report states: 2.1.4 CO2 fertilization benefits in IPCC Reports “The IPCC has only minimally discussed global greening and CO2 fertilization of agricultural crops. The topic is briefly acknowledged in a few places in the body of the IPCC 6th and earlier Assessment Reports but is omitted in all Summary documents. Section 2.3.4.3.3 of the AR6 Working Group I report, entitled “global greening and browning,” points out that the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land had concluded with high confidence that greening had increased globally over the past 2-3 decades. It then discusses that there are variations in the greening trend among data sets, concluding that while they have high confidence greening has occurred, they have low confidence in the magnitude of the trend. There are also brief mentions of CO2 fertilization effects and improvements in water use efficiency in a few other chapters in the AR6 Working Groups I and II Reports. Overall, however, the Policymaker Summaries, Technical Summaries, and Synthesis Reports of AR5 and AR6 do not discuss the topic.” [Boldface added] The chapter continues with: “2.2 The Alkaline Oceans 2.2.1 Changing pH. A neutral aqueous solution has a pH of 7.0, while one with pH greater than 7.0 is alkaline (also termed basic) and with pH less than 7.0 is acidic. The modern-day global average pH of surface sea water is estimated to be 8.04 (Copernicus Marine Service 2025, Figure 2.3), down from an estimated value of 8.2 in pre-Industrial times (Gattuso and Hansson, 2011). As CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increased, the oceans absorbed more, which decreases their pH. Depending upon the oceans’ buffering capacity, they are expected to become somewhat less alkaline over time, consistent with the observed decrease in pH.” Figure 2.3 is omitted here but in the text. “While this process is often called ‘ocean acidification,’ that is a misnomer because the oceans are not expected to become acidic; ‘ocean neutralization’ would be more accurate. Even if the water were to turn acidic, it is believed that life in the oceans evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic with pH 6.5 to 7.0 (Krissansen-Totton et al., 2018). On the time scale of thousands of years, boron isotope proxy measurements show that ocean pH was around 7.4 or 7.5 during the last glaciation (up to about 20,000 years ago) increasing to present-day values as the world warmed during deglaciation (Rae et al., 2018). Thus, ocean biota appears to be resilient to natural long-term changes in ocean pH since marine organisms were exposed to wide ranges in pH.” The Climate Working Group refutes the fear of “ocean acidification” promoted by NOAA during the Obama administration. Indeed, there are sections of the oceans above geothermal vents where the waters are acidic, pH below 7, where shellfish and other marine life live. The chapter concludes with: “In summary, ocean life is complex and much of it evolved when the oceans were acidic relative to the present. The ancestors of modern coral first appeared about 245 million years ago. CO2 levels for more than 200 million years afterward were many times higher than they are today. Much of the public discussion of the effects of ocean ‘acidification’ on marine biota has been one-sided and exaggerated.” [Boldface added] Chapter 3 begins with: “3 Human Influences on the Climate Chapter Summary: The global climate is naturally variable on all time scales. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions add to that variability by changing the total radiative energy balance in the atmosphere. The IPCC has downplayed the role of the sun in climate change but there are plausible solar irradiance reconstructions that imply it contributed to recent warming. Climate projections are based on IPCC emission scenarios that have tended to exceed observed trends. Most academic climate impact studies in recent years are based upon the extreme RCP 8.5 scenario that is now considered implausible; its use as a business-as-usual scenario has been misleading. Carbon cycle models connect annual emissions to growth in the atmospheric CO2 stock. While models disagree over the rate of land and ocean CO2 uptake, all agree that it has been increasing since 1959. There is evidence that urbanization biases in the land warming record have not been completely removed from climate data sets. 3.1 Components of radiative forcing and their history 3.1.1 Historical radiative forcing A changing climate has been the norm throughout the Earth’s 4.6-billion-year history. The Earth’s temperature and weather patterns change naturally over timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. Natural variations in the surface climate originate in two ways. Internal climate fluctuations associated with circulations in the atmosphere and ocean exchange energy, water, and carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. External influences on the climate system include variations in the energy received from the sun and the effects of volcanic eruptions. Human activities influence climate through changing land use and land cover. Humans are also changing the composition of the atmosphere by emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and by altering the concentration of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The earth is warmed by the sunlight it absorbs and is cooled by the heat it radiates to space. Averaged over the Earth’s surface, each of these processes involve power flows of about 240 Watts per square meter (W/m2). When they are in balance, there are no net external causes of warming or cooling. Both human and natural influences on the climate alter this balance and so cause the climate to change.” The Climate Working Group report presents graphs from the UN IPCC report AR6 (2021) [not shown here] then states: “These graphs show that the total radiative forcing is comprised of both natural and anthropogenic components. Carbon dioxide is the largest human influence on the climate and the one most relevant to the influence of fossil fuel use. It exerts a warming influence by decreasing the cooling power of the atmosphere. Emissions of CO2 are accumulating in the atmosphere, as described in the following section, so that the warming influence is growing. Other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, halogens, and ozone) act similarly, currently adding another 75 percent to CO2’s warming. Aerosols exert an overall cooling effect, although with large uncertainties in the way they catalyze the formation of reflective clouds. As a result, understanding the causes of recent warming requires not just identifying the warming effects of CO2, but also the more uncertain cooling effects of aerosols.” [Boldface added] It should be noted here that the Climate Working Group is discussing what the UN IPCC asserts, not what it necessarily accepts. As stated in the last TWTW, the global climate modelers assert that the modest warming from CO2 will be amplified by an equal warming from increasing water vapor and other warming such as methane, nitrous oxide, etc. The modelers have failed to produce the physical evidence demonstrating that this additional warming from other atmospheric gases is taking place. Periods of strong warming may be due to changes in the intensity of the sunlight hitting the surface of Earth, changes in ocean circulation, or other natural changes. This section of Chapter 3 concludes with: “Figure 3.1.1 [not shown here] shows that the anthropogenic forcing component was negligible before about 1900 and has increased steadily since, rising to almost 3 W/m2 today. However, this is still only about 1 percent of the unperturbed radiation flows, making it a challenge to isolate the effects of anthropogenic forcing; state of-the-art satellite estimates of global radiative energy flows are only accurate to a few W/m2. . Natural sources of global energy imbalance other than volcanoes and total solar irradiance (TSI) are not included in these [UN IPCC] graphs because they remain largely unknown.” [Boldface added] The Climate Working Group report continues with discussions of changes in atmospheric CO2 since 1958 as measured by Mauna Loa observatory and Future emission scenarios and the carbon cycle. A key paragraph in the discussion of the carbon cycle is: “The main processes that remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere are increased growth of land vegetation (especially at high latitudes), some increase in the sequestering of carbon in soils, and uptake of CO2 by the ocean due to the increasing partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 over that of CO2 dissolved in the ocean. All twenty land carbon cycle models tracked by the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al., 2024) show land processes have been removing excess CO2 at an increasing rate since 1959. This is consistent with a ‘global greening’ phenomenon (Chapter 2.1) observed by satellites since monitoring of global greenness began in 1982.” [Boldface added] In the section Urbanization influence on temperature trends, the Climate Working Group states the UN IPCC reports largely ignore the Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) despite increasing evidence and reports that they are significant. The section and chapter conclude with: “The challenge in measuring UHI bias is relating local temperature change to a corresponding change in population or urbanization, rather than to a static classification variable such as rural or urban. Spencer et al. (2025) used newly available historical population archives to undertake such an analysis and found evidence of significant UHI bias in U.S. summertime temperature data. In summary, while there is clear warming in the land record, there is also evidence that it is biased upward by patterns of urbanization and that these biases have not been completely removed by the data processing algorithms used to produce climate data sets.” The next TWTW will discuss the Climate Working Group report on Climate Response to CO2 Emissions to include Climate Sensitivity to CO2 Forcing and Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations. ********************* Towards Understanding the Importance of Increasing Greenhouse Gases: Kenneth Richard of No Tricks Zone discusses the paper “Unsettling the settled: simple musings on the complex climatic system” by Demetris Koutsoyiannis and George Tsakalias. The paper is an interesting thought experiment presenting physical evidence, not a hypothesis. In part, the abstract states: Our revisit of fundamental issues of climate challenges the notion and term of the “greenhouse effect,” and attempts a scientific reevaluation using minimal assumptions, such as Newton’s laws, maximum entropy, and gas spectroscopy. It replaces terms like “greenhouse gas” with “radiatively active gas” (RAG) and “greenhouse effect” with “atmospheric radiative effect” (ARE). While ARE exist in several planets’ atmospheres, on Earth it is primarily driven by water vapor and clouds, with CO2 playing a minor role (especially anthropogenic CO2 which represents 4% of total emissions). The paper discusses the works of van Wijngaarden and Happer. Then it later states: “3.5 What factors can explain the observed temperature profile? Given the analysis of the previous subsection, it becomes clear that it is not the ARE that creates and maintains the temperature gradient. Rather the mechanisms responsible for the temperature gradient are: • the warming of the soil and liquid water by the sunshine during the day and their cooling during the night; • the water evaporation and transpiration at the surface level and condensation aloft; • the convection, and the implied vertical transfer of sensible and latent heat; • the winds caused by spatial temperature differences and influenced by Coriolis forces. These are not static forcings, but processes, i.e., perpetual changes in the climatic system. The processes occur on different time scales, some of which are too small to drive the atmosphere to the equilibrium (isothermal) state. It is noted that the processes occur at a macroscopic level, with the motion of masses of air, typically referred to as parcels. And as noted by van Wijngaarden and Happer (2023), because of the very small thermal conductivity of air, it takes a very long time for appreciable heat to flow into or out of a parcel of reasonable size. The driving mechanisms of these processes are the following: 1. Clouds form and disappear, strongly affecting the SW and LW radiation processes. 2. The Earth’s surface is not homogeneous in terms of radiation absorption and reflection (varying albedo). The massive presence of water in liquid and solid phases with different albedo values, both on the Earth’s surface (hydrosphere, cryosphere) and in the atmosphere (clouds) is responsible for spatial and temporal variations in the albedo, as well as in the thermodynamic properties of different parts of the Earth. 3. Earth is round (not flat) and the sunrays come with different slopes at different places. 4. Earth rotates around its axis on a daily basis. 5. Earth rotates around the Sun on an annual basis. 6. Earth’s orbit around the Sun is elliptical, resulting in changes in the distance between the two bodies. 7. The climatic system is complex and is subject to irregular changes.” The paper ends with: “4 Discussion and conclusions The research presented here challenges the ideas that we live in a greenhouse and that science can be settled and revisits the most fundamental topics related to climate. This is attempted in the simplest possible way and using the fewest premises, such as Newton’s laws, the principle of maximum entropy and the spectroscopic properties of gases. Additionally, the study proposes that commonly used vocabulary should be replaced by rigorous scientific terminology, the main examples being “greenhouse gas” and “greenhouse effect”, which could be replaced by “radiatively active gas” (RAG, comprising water vapor—WV—and non-condensing radiatively active gases—NC-RAGs) and “atmospheric radiative effect” (ARE), respectively. The conclusions of the analyses presented here can be summarized as follows: • There is an empirically verified ARE in the atmosphere, not only on Earth but also on the other planets. On Earth, ARE is dominated by WV and clouds, with CO2 playing a very minor role—let alone human added CO2 which represents only 4% of the total emissions to the atmosphere. [Boldface added] • Equilibrium thermodynamics clearly show (either using the principle of maximum entropy, or stochastic simulation of molecule collisions) that Earth’s atmosphere would be isothermal at the equilibrium, with or without RAGs. In an isothermal atmosphere the temperature would be slightly higher than 250 K, a value which represents the vertically average temperature of the standard atmosphere over the troposphere and stratosphere. • The fact is that the atmosphere is not isothermal. Rather, the troposphere has a vertical temperature gradient of about 6.5 K/km, which is imprinted in the standard atmosphere. The gradient is resultant of macroscopic changes that drive the atmosphere out of equilibrium. While the moist adiabatic changes play a role in shaping this gradient, they cannot fully predict real atmospheric conditions. • The mean surface temperature of 288 K, also imprinted in the standard atmosphere, is much higher than the equilibrium temperature. While RAGs (mostly WV and clouds) play a role in yielding this temperature, the critical factor is the vertical temperature gradient, without which the ARE alone would not be able to increase the equilibrium temperature. • Given the importance of the atmospheric temperature gradient, which is described by large-scale atmospheric thermodynamics, rather than radiative physics, it is puzzling that the emphasis in climate research has been on the latter. This gradient is not a universal constant, but it varies with space and time. It is therefore useful to monitor and analyze its changes. The data show that since 1950 the gradient has weakened in the tropics and grown in the polar areas resulting in decrease of the surface equator-to-pole gradient, as expected in global warming conditions. A final point worth stressing is that in complex systems, such as the climatic system, observational data are the only scientific test bed for making hypotheses and assessing their validity. Focusing on one of the factors affecting the climatic system, namely, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and basing on models that emphasize this factor, may distort our perception of the big picture and be detrimental to science, whose objective is to pursue the truth.” [Boldface added] TWTW disagrees with “let alone human added CO2 which represents only 4% of the total emissions to the atmosphere.” The estimated CO2 level during the last interglacial warm period 130,000 to 115,000 years ago was 260 to 280 ppmv, Since 1958, the atmospheric CO2 as measured at Mauna Loa has increased from less than 320 ppmv to over 420 ppmv. Other than human emissions, there is no satisfactory explanation for this increase. However, TWTW agrees with the substance of the paper and the importance of CO2 on weather is overemphasized by politicians and others who claim that by controlling CO2 emissions they can control the weather and climate. They cannot. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Number of the Week: 93% pre-industrial? Many commentators seem to be confused by the concept of saturation as discussed in the works of van Wijngaarden and Happer. Discussed in last week’s TWTW, Howard Hayden’s paper has an excellent graph depicting saturation (Figure 14: Net IR blockage (seen from top of atmosphere) by CO2 versus CO2 concentration, adapted from van Wijngaarden & Happer.) A very small amount of CO2 accounts for the first 10 W/m2 of blocking and less than 50 ppmv accounts for more than 20 W/m2 of blocking. The effectiveness of additional units declines as the number of units increases. At less than 100 ppmv of CO2 in the atmosphere it is said to be saturated. This means that virtually all the radiative energy in the particular frequencies (or wavelengths) that CO2 most readily absorbs and emits radiation is being absorbed and emitted. CO2’s effectiveness is limited, and higher concentrations of CO2 have limited effectiveness. If we accept that the pre-industrial CO2 was about 280 ppmv, using Hayden’s figure we can estimate that by 280 ppmv about 93% of today’s warming effect of CO2 was occurring in pre-industrial times. The human influence is small. Note that these calculations are for clear skies. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer and Challenging the Orthodoxy.

On such evenings, temperatures can remain warm on hilltops or broad, level areas, but on lower portions of slopes or downstream of terrain gaps, temperatures can be significantly cooler. Even during the day, it can be much cooler beneath vegetated slopes, particularly shaded ones. We are talking about 1-10°F cooler.

Stern, Geophysical Research Letters, From plain language summary: After declining from 1979 to 2006, there was a huge loss of sea ice in September 2007, followed by 18 years of ups and downs but no long‐term trend. We say that a regime shift occurred in 2007 because the behavior of the September sea‐ice area changed from declining to stable. Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine US counties with animal feedlots have more air pollution, less health insurance: Study By Sharon Udasin, The Hill, Aug 12, 2025 Link to paper: Geography of animal feeding operations and their contribution to fine particulate matter pollution in vulnerable communities in the United States By Sanaz Chamanara, et al., Nature, Communications, Earth & Environment, Aug 12, 2025 From the abstract: Animal Feeding Operations or AFOs, such as beef feedlots, dairy farms, and hog farms, are associated with elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5). PM2.5 levels are significantly higher in census tracts with these operations than in those without: 28% higher in tracts with cattle operations and 11% higher in tracts with hog farms. Pollution burdens disproportionately affect socially vulnerable, minority populations with limited health insurance coverage, underscoring the need for targeted interventions.

It says that construction of these projects must be “continuous.” It also defines “having begun construction” as having done “physical work of a significant nature.” This includes activities like manufacturing equipment and excavating land to begin placing equipment in it. But it excludes activities like only having done surveys, test drilling or excavation for purposes of altering the landscape.

FERC Must Seize the Supreme Court’s Energy Opportunity By Dan Brouillette, Real Clear Energy, August 12, 2025 Environmental groups have weaponized NEPA reviews to block industrial projects across the board—fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, and battery storage alike—using speculative consequences that stretch far beyond any reasonable connection to the actual proposal.

Deeply buried on page 14 as the last paragraph of a section headed “A diverse resource mix supports grid reliability,” we find these two sentences: “Simply put, as New York seeks to retire more fossil fuel units in the coming years it will be essential to deploy new energy resources with the same reliability attributes to maintain grid reliability. Until new, non-emitting alternatives like hydrogen or advanced nuclear generation are developed and commercialized, fossil resources are needed to fill an essential role in preserving reliable grid operations.” Well as of today grid-scale hydrogen and advanced nuclear generation have not been “commercialized.” So, the only answer is to keep the fossil fuel generation going. Perhaps they should tell some of their co-bureaucrats, like NYSERDA, or the Energy Planning Board, or maybe even the Legislature or the New York City Council. But as of now NYISO’s strategy seems to be to put a warning somewhere deep in their reports just so they can say “I told you so” when the whole thing falls apart. They owe the New York citizenry much better. Caterpillar Among Groups Working on Massive Utah Data Center Campus By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, Aug 7, 2025 The groups in a news release wrote, “The project will deliver groundbreaking prime power and integrated combined cooling heat and power [CCHP] solutions with a by-design liquid cooling architecture.

Meta-Analysis of Over 100 Studies Shows Gas Stoves Pose No Increased Risks of Asthma It turns out, pushing unrealistic green energy schemes onto low- and middle-income people at the expense of a safer fuel source was not only bad science, it was dangerous propaganda. By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, Aug 8, 2025 Norway Restarts North Sea Drilling By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Aug 15, 2025 Norway became Britain’s primary source of gas last year as UK output shrank in the wake of the windfall tax and a ban on new licenses. The latest move is likely to see Norway sell even more supplies to the UK after its energy minister, Terje Aasland, said new licenses would allow it to be “a long-term supplier of oil and gas to Europe”.

Climate Lawyers Try a New Approach Heatstroke killed Julie Leon on a 108-degree day. A lawsuit blames oil companies. By Mike Toth, WSJ, Aug. 11, 2025 TWTW Summary; The research fellow at the Civitas Institute of the University of Texas Austin begins with: “Stung by a recent losing streak in state courts, the foundations, academics and trial lawyers behind the climate lawfare movement are now trying a new tactic: wrongful-death lawsuits against oil and gas companies based on the alleged connection between carbon emissions and weather-related deaths. Such efforts won’t stop until the Supreme Court affirms the federal government’s exclusive regulatory authority over interstate emissions. The leading such case, Leon v. Exxon Mobil, seeks to hold energy companies liable for the death of Julie Leon, who suffered heatstroke in her car in June 2021 after driving almost 100 miles without air conditioning on a day when temperatures hit a record-breaking 108 degrees in western Washington state. The complaint was filed in state court in May on behalf of Leon’s estate. [Boldface added] Climate lawfare previously centered on lawsuits by blue states and municipalities, which sought to transform the nation by forcing energy companies to make sweeping changes or bankrupting them with damages. These cases were based on state tort theories like public nuisance and consumer fraud. The plaintiffs maintained that energy companies deceived the public about the environmental consequences of their products, which accelerated climate change and caused harms such as wildfires and floods, which adversely affected states and cities. Even assuming these allegations are true, this theory turns the Constitution on its head. The federal government—not the states—regulates interstate activity. This means that Honolulu, Boulder, Colo., and other municipal climate-change plaintiffs can dictate local carbon policies, but they can’t decide energy policy for the U.S. as a whole. That’s Congress’s job. Judges around the country agreed. State judges in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have dismissed climate claims this year on jurisdictional grounds. As the Pennsylvania court noted: “Today we join a growing chorus of state and federal courts across the United States singing from the same hymnal, in concluding that the claims raised by Bucks County are not judiciable by any state court in Pennsylvania.” The Supreme Court has yet to close the door on such misuse of state-law claims. In January the justices declined to take up an appeal from the city of Honolulu’s lawsuit seeking to hold oil and gas companies liable for out-of-state conduct under state tort and consumer-protection law. With the justices so far unwilling to pre-empt the use of state tort law to regulate emissions nationwide, climate litigants are ginning up new legal claims like wrongful death. Plaintiffs who assert a link between extreme weather events and climate change still need to prove causation, which may never happen.” The article discusses issues with proving causation, then continues with. “Days before the lawsuit was filed, the Leon estate’s lawyer, Timothy Bechtold, helped the left-wing impact litigators at Our Children’s Trust seek millions in fees from a landmark Montana state court ruling that 16 youth plaintiffs were injured by climate change. Beyond wrongful-death claims, which can result only in money damages, influential climate advocates are already making the case that energy executives should face homicide prosecutions for deaths purportedly caused by climate change. Whether or not the Leon estate’s claims prevail, enterprising climate lawyers will continue to bring state claims over extreme weather events until the Supreme Court affirms the federal government’s regulatory authority of interstate emissions. Meantime, an industry vital to the nation’s economy and security will continue to operate at the whim of left-wing state courts.” TWTW Comment: The Montana case relied on a clause in the Montana constitution claiming a right to a stable climate, which has never existed, an example of illusory rights.

The Red Team is going to be fighting a very uphill battle given that the Blue Team is being ‘allowed’ (maliciously?) to establish the null hypothesis for this exercise along the lines of ‘CO2 emissions are harmful’, meaning that the former will bear the burden of proof. Adding to their burden are the facts that any court proceedings will certainly be held in Democrat strongholds and filtered through the lens of their captive media. Not good.

A decade of tech-fueled advice led to a 133 percent surge in U.S. computer science majors, now struggling in a job market flooded with AI tools. Rising AI adoption reduces demand for junior developers; some graduates apply to thousands of jobs but find no offers. 7.5 percent unemployment for CS engineers â more than double the rate for art history or biology graduates. Companies like Microsoft now funnel resources into A.I. education amid decreased hiring. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs.

Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. The "learn to code" mantra once promised a golden ticket to six-figure salaries in tech, but a wave of unemployment and disillusionment has replaced that optimism. Recent graduates with computer science degrees, enticed by corporate campaigns and federal initiatives, now confront a market where entry-level roles are shrinking due to AI tools and layoffs, leaving some to seek work at fast-food chains. The National Science Foundation reports that over 170,000 U.S. undergraduates majored in computer science in 2024 â more than double the 2014 total. Yet, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis reveals that unemployment among CS engineering graduates reached 7.5 percent in 2025, far exceeding rates for non-tech majors. Manasi Mishra, a 21-year-old Purdue graduate, epitomizes the shift. Despite excelling academically, she joked in a TikTok video that her only tech interview offer came from Chipotle, the burrito chain. âTech promised magic, but reality is bitter,â Mishra said, now pivoting to a sales role after months of job rejections. AI tools pinch entry-level opportunities The rise of AI coding platforms like GitHub Copilot and CodeRabbit has catalyzed a seismic shift in tech hiring. These tools can auto-generate code, debug workflows and reduce the need for junior developers. San Francisco billboards now tout A.I. software that âdebugs faster than humans,â underscoring the new reality. âThereâs a doom loop,â said Matthew Martin, an economist with Oxford Economics. âEntry-level roles â precisely where graduates seek their first jobs â are the most vulnerable to automation.â Zach Taylor, an Oregon State graduate, applied to 5,762 tech jobs since spring 2023, earning 13 interviews but no offers. âItâs demoralizing,â Taylor admitted. Now relying on unemployment benefits, heâs returned to his parentsâ home, building side projects to stay relevant. Even government roles, once seen as a safety net, face hurdles. Jamie Spoeri, a Georgetown graduate, applied to 200 jobs after a National Science Foundation internship yet encountered federal hiring freezes and A.I.-filtered rÃ©sumÃ©s. âAI isnât just replacing code â itâs replacing humans in the hiring process,â said data scientist Audrey Roller, who faced instant algorithmic rejection. Corporate and government responses: AI training vs. industry realities Leaders are recalibrating education strategies. $4 billion from Microsoft now funds AI-centric training, while the Biden administrationâs âAI action planâ repurposes federal dollars to steer students toward machine learning roles. However, critics argue this ignores structural issues like outsourcing and the saturation of A.I. tools. Tracy Camp, director of the Computing Research Association, noted that many universities still lack cutting-edge AI curricula, leaving graduates unprepared for rapid industry shifts. âSchools are playing catch-up,â she said. Meanwhile, major layoffs at Amazon, Microsoft and Meta â triggered by economic uncertainty and automationÂ â are compounding the crisis. According to Voronoi data, U.S. software developer job postings peaked in early 2022 before plummeting 33 percent by mid-2025. Student stories: From code to complacency? Despite the setbacks, some graduates are adapting. Mishra, now in sales, credits her TikTok beauty gig with broadening her career vision. âI realized I love tech marketing, not coding,â she said. Others, like Spoeri, stay hopeful. âAI will create new niches,â she argued, but cautioned: âWeâre in a transition phase.â The psychological toll is acute. Researchers like Jeff Forbes, a former NSF official, warn of disillusionment. âLast yearâs grads were fighting for offers. Now, many canât find any job,â Forbes said. A new era of tech work or a system in crisis? The collapse of the âcoding boomâ narrative reflects a deeper disconnect between education and industry evolution. While AI tools offer efficiency gains, theyâve left a generation of tech graduates â many of whom followed corporate and government advice â struggling to justify their degrees. The solution may lie in blended skills: combining technical expertise with creativity, sales, or policy. As Mishraâs pivot shows, adaptability remains critical. Yet, resolving systemic issues â from outsourcing to uneven A.I. training â will require collaboration between academia, tech firms and policymakers to align workforce preparedness with market realities. For now, the once-golden age of computer science has entered a period of reckoning.

The solution may lie in blended skills: combining technical expertise with creativity, sales, or policy. As Mishraâs pivot shows, adaptability remains critical. Yet, resolving systemic issues â from outsourcing to uneven A.I. training â will require collaboration between academia, tech firms and policymakers to align workforce preparedness with market realities. For now, the once-golden age of computer science has entered a period of reckoning.

Corporate and government responses: AI training vs. industry realities Leaders are recalibrating education strategies. $4 billion from Microsoft now funds AI-centric training, while the Biden administrationâs âAI action planâ repurposes federal dollars to steer students toward machine learning roles. However, critics argue this ignores structural issues like outsourcing and the saturation of A.I. tools. Tracy Camp, director of the Computing Research Association, noted that many universities still lack cutting-edge AI curricula, leaving graduates unprepared for rapid industry shifts. âSchools are playing catch-up,â she said. Meanwhile, major layoffs at Amazon, Microsoft and Meta â triggered by economic uncertainty and automationÂ â are compounding the crisis.

Title: BlackRock’s 5% MicroStrategy stake: Is Bitcoin’s biggest whale in danger?

What happens if Strategy is forced to sell? BlackRock’s growing influence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and a stake in Strategy raises fears of market manipulation. What was once “the people’s money” risks becoming another Wall Street asset. BlackRock’s growing influence in the crypto sector has sparked intense speculation, with reports suggesting the firm may be orchestrating one of the largest market shake-ups yet. After acquiring a 5% stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially to influence Michael Saylor’s massive Bitcoin [BTC] holdings, BlackRock has propelled both Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs to fresh highs. Ethereum took center stage on Wall Street as spot ETH ETFs logged a record $1.019 billion net inflow on the 11th of August, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) surpassing $10 billion. Meanwhile, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also clocked a milestone, crossing $91.06 billion in assets under management amid Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high of $124,500. This shows that BlackRock is no longer just holding Bitcoin; it’s moving to control it. It may look minor, but this move effectively connects the two largest Bitcoin whales, BlackRock and Michael Saylor’s Strategy. For those unaware, Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy depends on debt and stock issuance, making it vulnerable if its stock price drops, and BlackRock knows this. By pressuring MSTR shares, it could push Saylor into liquidating reserves, crashing BTC’s price, only to buy it back cheaply and tighten its grip on the market. This isn’t speculation without evidence. Additionally, in June, Strategy moved 7,382 BTC (around $850 million) to Coinbase Prime, not typical behavior for long-term holders, but a clear sign of preparation for potential liquidation. Around the same time, BlackRock sold over $500 million worth of Bitcoin in just 48 hours. For a firm of their size, that’s pocket change, but symbolically, it points toward a broader reset strategy. If BlackRock triggers this cascade, the fallout could be brutal and Bitcoin could plunge to $65K–$60K, Ethereum to $1.7K, while altcoins face losses of 80–90%. Derivatives markets would also implode, exchanges might freeze, and retail investors would capitulate at the worst possible moment. Meanwhile, institutions would be quietly accumulating the very assets retail abandoned in fear. The most dangerous part would be that BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, already controls flows of hundreds of thousands of BTC. By adding influence over Strategy, they would dominate both direct Bitcoin supply and corporate reserves. What looks like a market strategy is actually a bid for a monopoly. If one entity can corner 70% of Bitcoin’s supply, decentralization, the very foundation of crypto, collapses. For BlackRock, it’s not about short-term profits. It’s about accumulation, dominance, and rewriting the rules of the Bitcoin market. If such a strategy unfolds, it could mark a turning point for Bitcoin’s identity. What began as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance may risk being reshaped into yet another Wall Street instrument, traded, leveraged, and collateralized like gold or oil. The recent slip in Strategy’s stock price to $366.32, down 1.78% in the past 24 hours, underscores the fragility of this balance. Therefore, as institutional giants tighten their grip, the crypto community faces a pressing question. Will Bitcoin remain “the people’s money,” or evolve into a tool of centralized financial power?

August 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy — marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration. This bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on August 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution. A replay of the announcement can be found here: https://www.ff.com/us/2025-pebble-beach/ EAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm Faraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while Crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation — a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy. “The next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,” said Ian Calderon, FF Co-Creation Officer and Founding Board Member of the California Blockchain Working Group. “FF is building a dual-engine circular growth system — combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity Crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what’s possible in mobility and financial innovation.” “Today's launch is a powerful example of our state's pioneering spirit, bringing together intelligent electric vehicles, blockchain, and the worlds of Web 2 and Web 3, along with industry, capital and technology,” said Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer. “This model has the potential to boost our economy, create high quality jobs, attract top tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 FF’s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement — while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy. “The Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “FF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era — we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.” Introducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets FF also officially announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the world’s top 10 crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), calculated from midnight Pacific Time on August 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000. The Index will be tracked in real-time on FF.com and the FF App. Accompanying the Index, the FFAI C10 Treasury is being launched — targeting $500M to $1B in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to securing necessary funding, with an initial $30M purchase. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive, 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to provide sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3%–5%, which can fund product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth. FF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index. Crypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future’s Financial Structure The Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company intends to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improve net asset value and structure. Structure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency FF’s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization — while reinforcing each other. With this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company’s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner. ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company. Founded in 2014, the Company’s mission is to disrupt the automotive industry by creating a user-centric, technology-first, and smart driving experience.

Title: Ex-Washington Post fact checker hits ‘absentee owner’ Bezos, tells him to commit to saving paper or sell it
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-washington-post-fact-checker-hits-absentee-owner-bezos-tells-him-commit-saving-paper-sell
Time Published: 2025-08-17T20:00:19Z
Full Content:
Former Washington Post face checker Glenn Kessler spoke with Fox News Digital about the paper's "absentee owner" Jeff Bezos and the challenges the news outlet faces. The Washington Post is a sinking ship with a captain missing in action. And according to its now-former fact-checker, that missing captain is its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. "He has to be committed to it. If he's not committed to it, he should find someone else to own it," Glenn Kessler told Fox News Digital. "I feel like he was kind of committed to it. And then he's kind of an absentee owner, and he shouldn't be because it's, you know, one of the prime assets of American journalism." Kessler left the Post in July after more than 27 years at the paper — and his final years there were not the best. "What's so saddening is that five years ago, I would not have imagined The Washington Post would be in this state," Kessler said. WASHINGTON POST'S EFFORTS TO COURT CONSERVATIVES COULD DRIVE AWAY ITS LIBERAL READERS, EX-FACT CHECKER WARNS Former Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler says billionaire Jeff Bezos "has to be committed" to saving the paper he owns or "find someone else to own it." (Getty images / Singerhmk - wiki commons) Kessler never considered leaving the Post until he was presented with the buyout offer, which he accepted. The Post has been financially bleeding, so much so that it reportedly was on pace to lose at least $77 million in 2024. The buyouts had targeted the most veteran staffers, aiming to cut costs and ward off layoffs for the time being. The famed fact-checker was among several high-profile journalists and columnists who have left the paper in recent months, many of whom took issue with decisions and editorial changes Bezos himself had ordered. Kessler compared the Post to "being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone" in a piece he wrote on his newly-launched Substack account. "They have to have a vision of where they want to go. And I've not seen that vision yet. Or if there is a vision, it's not been clearly articulated," Kessler said. "It's gonna be a really rocky period in the news business in the next five to ten years. And the Post needs to be prepared for that. And I kind of feel like they've lost a lot of, you know, important sailors and captains to keep the ship going. So they're gonna have to make do with less." Bezos has been the target of intense blowback by liberals, who've accused him of bending the knee to President Donald Trump based on actions that have rocked the paper. First was his decision in October to halt the planned endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. Then, in February, he launched a new mission for the editorial pages to promote "personal liberties and free markets," vowing to not publish any pieces that go against those principles. Both instances sparked rebellion among the paper's liberal readers, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of subscriptions. Several staffers also resigned in protest. But Kessler wasn't always a Bezos critic. He credited the Amazon founder for saving the Post when he bought it in 2013. "Before Bezos bought the newspaper, it was in really bad shape," he told Fox News Digital. "People forget how, you know, because the Graham family didn't really have the resources to keep it going in the new era. And there had been a bunch of buyouts and people were asked to leave. So it had been a pretty grim period then." WASHINGTON POST BOMBARDED WITH ‘CAKE’ PARTIES FOR DEPARTING STAFFERS Kessler called Jeff Bezos an "absentee owner" of The Washington Post. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Things at the Post were souring so much so that Kessler himself had been interviewing for a different job outside the paper. That was until he was offered The Fact Checker stint in 2011, which he accepted, thinking that if the ship went down, he himself could stay afloat with his own "brand." "But then Bezos bought the paper, and he invested a lot of money in the paper," Kessler said. "So the size of the staff doubled. The number of foreign bureaus probably went up [by] at least a third. The resources devoted to engineering support surged, so the web pages started loading faster, and we could do fantastic graphics. There was investment in video… And you really felt like the Post was going places, and it was actually producing better journalism at any point in the time I had worked at the Post." "And now it is just… it's like it hit an iceberg, and it's kind of drifting there, and I don't think there's a plan to rescue it. Or at least a plan to, you know, turn the ship around and get it moving in the direction it was." Kessler blamed management for being "a little dazzled" by the traffic spike that came during the first Trump administration, reaching levels "almost equal" to the Post's top rival, The New York Times. But then, unlike the Times, the Post failed to capitalize on its new readers by not expanding its portfolio. "I've sat in many meetings and had many discussions and heard lots of speeches. I still have no idea what they're trying to do," Kessler said of his former bosses. "It vaguely seems to say we're gonna appeal [to] the people… who don't really care about the news. And we're gonna provide products that would allow them to read The Washington Post and find out information they need to know," he said. "And the problem, as I wrote in my piece, is that that's what The New York Times has been doing for ten years. They have 10 million subscribers, but a large chunk of that are people that don't get the core news product," Kessler continued. "They get the recipes, they get The Athletic — the sports section, they get product recommendations, they get the games, they play Wordle." WASHINGTON POST REELING FROM BUYOUT EXODUS AS BOSSES HOPE TO TURN THE PAGE AT EMBATTLED PAPER He said the Post is stuck with "the Avis problem," citing the car rental company's old ads that claimed "We try harder," alluding to the reality it was always in the shadow of Hertz, a dynamic similar to the Gray Lady. "The Washington Post has always been No. 2. It's never had the same size circulation as the Times. I would argue news coverage was better, but maybe I was biased about that," Kessler conceded to Fox News Digital. "But now in this fragmented marketplace, people have to make a choice. What Substacks am I going to subscribe to? What newsletters am I gonna get? What networks am I going to watch? ‘Oh, I need one newspaper. I'll be willing to spend money on one newspaper,' and the default is always going to be, unfortunately, The New York Times." He continued, "It's a broader product. It has better arts coverage, theater coverage. I've never gotten an understanding of how the Post was going to combat that problem. And it sounded like the solution was, 'Oh, we're going to be like a mini-me New York Times with things to appeal to people that don't follow news.' Well, they already get that in The New York Times." The Post has scrapped an initiative launched last year dubbed "WP Ventures," meant to attract social media users. However, the paper appears to already be pivoting with Tuesday's announcement of former Axios executive editor and former Post reporter, Sara Kehaulani Goo, returning as its president of Creator Network — a new position Goo says will be "creating personality-driven content" and help provide advertisers "access" to a new audience driven by creators. The Washington Post had just implemented a round of buyouts targeting the most veteran of staffers. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images) The Times and the rise of new media weren't the only obstacles facing the Post. "Midway through my journalism career, I started saying, 'I'm working for a dinosaur.' And AI is quite possibly the meteorite that will kill off the last of the dinosaurs," Kessler said to Fox News Digital. "I'm greatly concerned about what AI is gonna do, because AI is gonna kill search. And search was how people often found our news articles." "The statistics I had seen was that four or five years ago, every 100 searches on Google yielded six clicks on a news site. Now it's about every 100 searches yields two clicks on the news site. When people use AI, a thousand searches result in one click," he continued. "So it's a dramatic difference. And if I were running a news organization, at this point, I don't know quite what I would do about that. So it's a bad time to be running a new organization. I do have sympathy for the situation that [Washington Post publisher and CEO] Will Lewis and [Washington Post executive editor] Matt Murray find themselves in right now. I just question whether or not they really have figured out what to do." Goo said in her announcement that "we're going to be infusing AI with everything that we do to help us maximize efficiency and scale." But the buck ultimately stops with Bezos, according to Kessler. "The Post was really at its high point [after Bezos' purchase]— the amount of stories we're producing, the quality of the stories was really significant. And then, traffic surged when Trump got elected and there was so much hunger and interest in the news we were producing. We kind of lost our way after that," Kessler said. "And not only lost our way, we started losing oodles of money. A hundred million dollars one year, I think the last number I saw [in] 2023 was $77 million… I think even for a person as rich as Jeff Bezos, that counts as real money." "And I have gotten the sense that he's a bit of an absentee owner. He's had other distractions, and he's committed more to some of his other enterprises, such as a space company, than he is to The Washington Post, which is really just a tiny part of his business investments. And maybe, I don't know, I hate to speculate, maybe you thought he gave us his best shot, and we blew it, and now we've got it muddled through," he added. A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital, "The Washington Post is reinventing itself to be a trusted news source for all Americans. That means working hard each day to publish the most accurate news, alongside opinions that resonate across the nation."

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appointed as WEF interim co-chair

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, alongside Roche’s André Hoffmann. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The World Economic Forum (WEF), the influential global convening force for policymakers and industry leaders, has appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as interim co-chair. The move comes hot on the heels of a high-profile internal review that cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of wrongdoing and set the stage for a temporary leadership overhaul as the organization recalibrates its governance model. With trillions in assets under management, BlackRock commands outsized influence across financial markets, ESG policy, and the investment strategies of governments and corporations. Fink’s interim appointment is a strategic move that could accelerate the institutional adoption of digital assets like Bitcoin within global policy forums and mainstream financial infrastructure. Fink’s appointment comes at a time when questions around institutional trust, sustainability, and cross-border cooperation are more acute than ever. Under Fink’s guidance, BlackRock has been a pioneer of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, pushing for a more climate-resilient global economy; a priority that has increasingly permeated WEF dialogues in Davos and beyond. BlackRock has also been a major institutional force in crypto markets, and its landmark Bitcoin spot ETF approval in early 2024 dramatically accelerated adoption and legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class for pensions, endowments, and retail investors globally. With Fink at the helm of the WEF, the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset economy blur even further. The Forum regularly shapes global regulatory, economic, and technology discussions, and Fink now holds considerable influence over both Wall Street and Davos. Fink’s appointment could usher in a more progressive stance on crypto within elite policy circles, potentially opening doors for greater integration of Bitcoin and blockchain solutions in global finance and among world decision-makers. The internal review that prompted these shifts centered on longstanding questions about Klaus Schwab’s role and the organizational structure of the Forum. Schwab, who founded the WEF in 1971, has long been a focal point for criticism and, lately, scrutiny regarding governance. After clearing Schwab of wrongdoing, the WEF announced its intention to install interim co-chairs in a bid to increase transparency and bring new perspectives to the leadership table. Fink’s appointment thereby serves a dual purpose: to reassure stakeholders by placing a respected industry leader in stewardship, and to reinforce the Forum’s commitment to institutional accountability and renewal. Fink will serve alongside other interim co-chair, André Hoffmann, vice chairman of Roche Holding AG, forming a joint leadership that reflects the WEF’s renewed mandate for broad-based, multi-sector collaboration. With geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainties, and the accelerating pace of climate change occupying center stage, the incoming interims face a tall order: restore confidence, drive progress across key global issues, and prepare the Forum for its next chapter.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/17/2025 10:33:47 AM PDT by Roman_War_Criminal In April, at an extraordinary meeting of the World Economic Forum (“WEF”) board, Klaus Schwab announced he was stepping down with immediate effect and bogeyman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed the interim Chairman. On 15 August, with the completion of the investigation into Klaus Schwab and his wife Hilde, Brabeck-Letmathe has stepped down from his role as interim Chairman. On the same day, the World Economic Forum announced the appointment of Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, as interim co-chairman alongside André Hoffmann, Vice Chairman of pharmaceutical and diagnostic giant Roche. This appointment takes effect immediately. Much has been written about Larry Fink and BlackRock, so in this article, we explore André Hoffmann’s background. (snip) Who is André Hoffmann? A lot has been written over the years about Larry Fink and the infamous BlackRock. In this article, we’ll explore Fink’s new WEF partner in crime: André Hoffmann. Since 2006, Swiss businessman André Hoffman has been the Vice Chairman of Roche Holding AG, the family business. He also sits on the Board of SystemIQ, and WEF’s Board of Trustees and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. He is also on the Board of Fellows for the School of Medicine at Stanford Medicine. Additionally, according to Wikispooks, he is a member of the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Steering Committee, Chatham House Governors and the Global Commission for Post-Pandemic Policy.

Title: The “Layer 1” Fight Is Not About Stablecoins But The Future Of Finance

ByDavid G.W. Birch ByDavid G.W. Birch, Contributor. With the GENIUS Act signed, stablecoins are on a tear. According to the management consultancy McKinsey, the total value of issued stablecoins has doubled to $250 billion today from $120 billion 18 months ago, and it is forecast to reach more than $400 billion by year-end (and $2 trillion by 2028). Wow. In addition to stablecoins tokens, a number of yield-bearing tokens are out there now. These tokens, typically an investment in short-duration government securities, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ($2.9 billion) and the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund ($0.8 billion). Big money, and hence the reasons for the “Layer 1” or “Layer 2” discussions in decentralised finance (DeFi) circles. I am sure you are all familiar with the distinction, but for those who are new to this space, when DeFi people talk about Layer 1 they mean a distributed ledger of some kind (such as the Bitcoin blockchain) whereas Layer 2 networks run on top of the Layer 1 blockchains in order to delivered improved performance or additional functionality. The Layer 2 networks execute transactions off of the ledgers but use Layer 1 to provide the underlying security and finality. So, for example: Bitcoin is a Layer 1 protocol, but on top of this people have built Lightning, which is a Layer 2 service that uses off-chain “payment channels” to make Bitcoin transactions work at point-of-sale (POS). Similarly, Ethereum is a Layer 1 blockhain and Arbitrum is a Layer 2 service that uses a “rollup” mechanism to anchor transactions. Well, so far, so technical. But there is escalating competition in this space and that has business implications. The news that major players, such as Circle and Stripe, are developing their own Layer 1 networks is rather interesting. Given their investments in the stablecoin space it seems logical for Stripe, for example, to create a new high performance Layer 1 blockchain specially designed to for payment processing. Their blockchain, known as “Tempo”, is compatible with Ethereum’s programming language so developers will be able to easily migrate “smart" “contracts” to the new blockchain. Similarly, Circle announced its new Layer-1 blockchain “Arc” (also compatible with the Ethereum programming language) which they say is optimised for stablecoin-based financial services. Arc has native support for the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and stablecoins including USDC, EURC and USYC1. It also has, rather interestingly from my point of view, an opt-in privacy schemes that offers selectively shielded transactions. Circle say that Arc is designed not only for stablecoins but for all forms of digital money and tokenized value in the future, a point I will return to later on. Now you might ask, since Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to work, why are serious players in the stablecoin space looking to build their own Layer 1 blockchains while others are already building Layer 2 rails (such as Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum and Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack) that also seem to work. There are, broadly speaking there are two business pressures: functionality and economics. Functionality first. A good reason to develop a Layer 1 is to ensure the development of features that are required by the ecosystem. Now that this infrastructure is no longer a technical detail but a defining factor in who leads the next phase of digital finance, business is paying attention and as stablecoins begin to be used in mainstream business applications, so operational pressures will increase and favour platforms that are secure, compliant and capable of high-throughput transactions. As the respected industry commentator Noelle Acheson noted in the case of both Circle and Stripe, these will be the priorities of most financial services players but they are not necessarily the priorities of blockchains such as the Bitcoin blockchain, which was optimised for censorship resistance. There is also the element of control: decentralisation sounds good but it would be annoying to find that your payroll payments to employees are held up because everyone is playing some sort of cryptokitties game or messing around with NFTs. Then there are the economics. The fact is that running decentralised network is expensive. If you want the censorship resistance of Bitcoin then you have to consume enormous amounts of energy and therefore charge significant fees. This is a key reason people started building Layer 2 networks in the first place. But if you don’t need the pseudonymity and censorship resistance (ie, you are running a regulated financial service) then you can redesign the infrastructure in a far more cost-effective way. You can imagine, then, that if Stripe offers stablecoin services to its global customer base, it will offer them its own stablecoins running over its own network and the transactions will never go anywhere near the world’s banking networks except for on- and off-ramps. Assuming, that is, that Stripe’s customers won’t want to hold stablecoin balances that are non-interest bearing. (Of course once the service is up and running then Stripe can offer their infrastructure to third-parties so that they can use the Stripe Layer 1 to provide stablecoin services to their own customers. Given that payments are such a huge, but vulnerable, profit pool for the TradFi incumbents they they will have to respond.) Where does this take us then? I suspect that the average consumer (eg, me) will have zero interest in Layer 1 or Layer 2 of indeed how any payments get anywhere. If I tell my accounting package to go ahead and pay a supplier in Canada, I really do not care how the money gets there: if Stripe uses open banking to take the money out of my UK account, take Canadian Dollar stablecoins from their Treasury and then send these stablecoins over to Canada where they are then paid out to the supplier using Interac e-Transfer, or whether they send the money from my bank account via SWIFT to a Canadian bank account, I do not care. Hence the winners and losers here will be determined by their cost-benefit performance for business. The battle for Layer 1, though, is not only about the battle to control payments, because it is about much more than stablecoins. As Circle indicated, it is about the future of value, a future in which the continuous exchange of “real world” digital assets replaces the traditional infrastructure (and associated overheads) of clearing and settlement vanish. In this world, the next-general financial market infrastructure of distributed ledgers, tokens and protocols (that is, “defi”) that will in essence become critical national infrastructure. Can this really be provided Circle or Stripe? Or will it ultimately need Big Tech or governments or someone else to deliver the platform for innovation?

August 17, 2025 09:49 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: These Dirt Cheap Dividends Pay 4x-9x The Market

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The market-at-large is expensive by historical metrics. So let’s look past the pricey, low-yielding ETFs in favor of cheap dividends. That’s right, good ol’ value investing bargains. With high yields too! We’re talking about divvies of 5%, 8% and even 11% that we’ll discuss in a moment. The spring market dip sure was brief, wasn’t it? The S&P 500 sank into near-bear territory in roughly a month, then snapped back just as quick. In doing so, Mr. and Ms. Market took valuations to high levels. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1 remains in rarefied air, last reached during the COVID rebound, and before that, the dot-com bubble. Which is fine. We’ll leave the 22 P/Es to the vanilla investors while we focus on bargains with respect to two “cash is king” metrics: Let’s start with Virginia-based electric utility AES Corp. (AES, 5.5% yield), which we recently discussed as a low-beta name. This means AES, being a safe, stodgy utility, is more insulated from market pullbacks than run-of-the-mill dividends. AES also has upside potential. Its renewable energy-selling business gives it growth potential that many utility stocks don’t have. It’s also cheap. AES trades at a cheap 5 times cash-flow estimates, as well as a 0.6 PEG that implies it’s also cheap compared to its growth estimates. (Remember: A PEG under 1.0 signals that a stock is inexpensive.) The stock yields more than 5%, to boot, which is better than the already generous utility sector. Edison International (EIX, 5.9%) is another utility company—this one more typical of the sector. It’s the parent of regulated utility Southern California Edison (SCE), which serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. It does, however, have a second business—Trio (formerly Edison Energy), a global energy advisory firm that serves large commercial, industrial and institutional organizations. Unlike other utilities, however, EIX is a bit more “exciting.” It spent years in court fighting litigation over wildfire damage and ended up having to pay multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements. And the legal drama has returned in 2025. Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, with most of that coming in January amid Los Angeles County wildfires, including the massive Eaton Fire, which prompted multiple suits against SCE over allegations that the company had “violated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs.” SCE is also being investigated in connection with the Hurst Fire. If, for a minute, we closed our eyes and ignored all that, there’s a lot to like about Edison. It’s expected to generate decent top-line growth and a significant snap-back in profits over the next couple years. The big drop in shares has launched EIX’s yield to nearly 6%. It trades at just 3 times cash-flow estimates. And its PEG, which at fractionally under 1 suggests the stock is only mildly underpriced, is substantially down from the nearly 3 it traded at when I evaluated the stock a couple years ago. But we can’t ignore the fire liabilities—they’re why EIX’s valuations are so low. That makes Edison a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility. Amcor (AMCR, 5.2% yield) is technically a cyclical stock, but it acts defensively. That’s because, as a packaging specialist, it’s in the business of—well, other business’s business. It makes everything from high-barrier paperboard trays for beef and meats to glass dressing bottles to overwrap for home and personal care. And its applications go far beyond the grocery store: Amcor’s products are used in garden and outdoor products, agriculture, pet care, healthcare, even building and construction. So Amcor is simultaneously a play on the broader economy and all the businesses it supports, but it also fills a vital need across a diversified set of companies. AMCR stands out for a few reasons: Kodiak Gas Services (KGS, 5.2% yield) is an energy services firm that provides natural gas compression services, mostly in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Its compression units are critical to upstream and midstream natural gas firms, so it’s able to secure multiyear, fixed-revenue contracts. There’s nothing novel about the business model, though. Like other energy services firms, if natural gas/liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in demand, Kodiak will be in demand, so the fact that global LNG demand is expected to grow over the next few years bodes well for KGS. That’s in large part because Kodiak is extremely well-positioned to capture that growth. In late 2023, KGS announced it would acquire CSI Compressco LP to create the industry’s largest compression fleet. Kodiak’s fleet is young, too (read: less maintenance and replacement costs). There’s not much stock history to examine, however. Kodiak is a relatively new issue that went public just a few months before the CSI announcement. But the company has started a dividend and raised it twice since then, including a nearly 10% improvement announced in April 2025. Meanwhile, its yield has wafted up to over 5% amid energy’s weakness this year—and left shares relatively cheap. KGS trades at roughly 6 times cash flow estimates and a low PEG of 0.13. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI, 8.4% yield) is another Permian Basin energy equipment and services firm, this one providing transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as other oilfield services companies. Its most important offering is mesh frac sand used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). I had been keeping tabs on it because of its unorthodox streak of dividend hikes, but that streak stopped earlier this year. It’s not ideal. Nor is the fact that AESI shares have been hammered to the tune of 45% this year. Again, energy services haven’t had a great 2025, but Atlas has been downright miserable amid slower-than-expected U.S. completion activity and droopy frac-sand prices. If there’s any silver lining to that, it’s that AESI shares now trade at just 5.7 times estimates for cash flows, as well as an attractive PEG of 0.75. The dividend at least appears to be safe, too. While things look bad from an adjusted earnings perspective ($1.00 in dividends annually vs. forecasts for just 25 cents this year), Atlas has more than enough FCF to cover the payout. Example: Last quarter, it generated $48.9 million in adjusted FCF while paying out $30.9 million. Those cash flows are substantial because AESI is a low-cost operator—crucial for survival in this industry. But like any energy services provider, Atlas needs commodity prices to cooperate. It’s unusual for a blue-chip stock like United Parcel Service (UPS, 7.5%) to yield north of 7%, but it’s also rare for a blue-chip stock like UPS to have its shares hemorrhage so much without a recession or broader bear market. Lower-margin e-commerce volumes, higher costs because of its unionized workforce, and a weak freight environment hampered the company in 2024. Then in early 2025, it spooked investors with a weak 2025 forecast and announced that—in hopes of shifting away from those lower-margin volumes—it would drastically reduce its business with Amazon (AMZN), which accounted for roughly 10%-12% of annual UPS revenues. The April tariff announcement also hit shares hard. The result? UPS shares have lost nearly half of their value in just two years. The upshot? UPS trades at roughly 8 times cash-flow estimates and has never offered a better yield in its 26 years of trading. Is UPS a dividend trap? Perhaps. The company pulled its full-year revenue and profit forecasts in April, and didn’t bring them back in its late July report. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a roughly 15% drop in adjusted earnings, to $6.61 per share. That specific number matters: UPS has a target dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% of prior-year adjusted EPS. It currently pays $6.56 across four quarterly dividends. (That’s 99%!) CEO Carol Tomé continued to signal commitment to the dividend in the earnings call—“UPS is rock-solid strong and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet,” she said—but if the delivery giant continues to struggle, simple numbers might force management’s hand. Western Union (WU, 11.3% yield), somehow, is still in business. Payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle have been taking business from the “OG” of money transfer. WU boasts a big yield but for the wrong reason—its divvie looks big because shares are (deservedly) way down! WU, to its credit, has launched an initiative called “Evolve 2025” in which it’s rolling out new products, improvements and an operational efficiency program. It’s also expanding its digital wallet offerings in Mexico and Singapore. And its latest move, announced just a couple days ago, is the $500 million acquisition of Miami-based International Money Express (IMXI), aka Intermex, which serves some 6 million customers who send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany to more than 60 countries. But c’mon man—this dog is dead. The business trades for 4x cash flow and a sub-5 forward P/E, but who cares? Not me. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1 remains in rarefied air, last reached during the COVID rebound, and before that, the dot-com bubble. Which is fine. We’ll leave the 22 P/Es to the vanilla investors while we focus on bargains with respect to two “cash is king” metrics: Let’s start with Virginia-based electric utility AES Corp. (AES, 5.5% yield), which we recently discussed as a low-beta name. This means AES, being a safe, stodgy utility, is more insulated from market pullbacks than run-of-the-mill dividends. AES also has upside potential. Its renewable energy-selling business gives it growth potential that many utility stocks don’t have. It’s also cheap. AES trades at a cheap 5 times cash-flow estimates, as well as a 0.6 PEG that implies it’s also cheap compared to its growth estimates. (Remember: A PEG under 1.0 signals that a stock is inexpensive.) The stock yields more than 5%, to boot, which is better than the already generous utility sector. Edison International (EIX, 5.9%) is another utility company—this one more typical of the sector. It’s the parent of regulated utility Southern California Edison (SCE), which serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. It does, however, have a second business—Trio (formerly Edison Energy), a global energy advisory firm that serves large commercial, industrial and institutional organizations. Unlike other utilities, however, EIX is a bit more “exciting.” It spent years in court fighting litigation over wildfire damage and ended up having to pay multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements. And the legal drama has returned in 2025. Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, with most of that coming in January amid Los Angeles County wildfires, including the massive Eaton Fire, which prompted multiple suits against SCE over allegations that the company had “violated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs.” SCE is also being investigated in connection with the Hurst Fire. If, for a minute, we closed our eyes and ignored all that, there’s a lot to like about Edison. It’s expected to generate decent top-line growth and a significant snap-back in profits over the next couple years. The big drop in shares has launched EIX’s yield to nearly 6%. It trades at just 3 times cash-flow estimates. And its PEG, which at fractionally under 1 suggests the stock is only mildly underpriced, is substantially down from the nearly 3 it traded at when I evaluated the stock a couple years ago. But we can’t ignore the fire liabilities—they’re why EIX’s valuations are so low. That makes Edison a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility. Amcor (AMCR, 5.2% yield) is technically a cyclical stock, but it acts defensively. That’s because, as a packaging specialist, it’s in the business of—well, other business’s business. It makes everything from high-barrier paperboard trays for beef and meats to glass dressing bottles to overwrap for home and personal care. And its applications go far beyond the grocery store: Amcor’s products are used in garden and outdoor products, agriculture, pet care, healthcare, even building and construction. So Amcor is simultaneously a play on the broader economy and all the businesses it supports, but it also fills a vital need across a diversified set of companies. AMCR stands out for a few reasons: Kodiak Gas Services (KGS, 5.2% yield) is an energy services firm that provides natural gas compression services, mostly in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Its compression units are critical to upstream and midstream natural gas firms, so it’s able to secure multiyear, fixed-revenue contracts. There’s nothing novel about the business model, though. Like other energy services firms, if natural gas/liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in demand, Kodiak will be in demand, so the fact that global LNG demand is expected to grow over the next few years bodes well for KGS. That’s in large part because Kodiak is extremely well-positioned to capture that growth. In late 2023, KGS announced it would acquire CSI Compressco LP to create the industry’s largest compression fleet. Kodiak’s fleet is young, too (read: less maintenance and replacement costs). There’s not much stock history to examine, however. Kodiak is a relatively new issue that went public just a few months before the CSI announcement. But the company has started a dividend and raised it twice since then, including a nearly 10% improvement announced in April 2025. Meanwhile, its yield has wafted up to over 5% amid energy’s weakness this year—and left shares relatively cheap. KGS trades at roughly 6 times cash flow estimates and a low PEG of 0.13. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI, 8.4% yield) is another Permian Basin energy equipment and services firm, this one providing transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as other oilfield services companies. Its most important offering is mesh frac sand used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). I had been keeping tabs on it because of its unorthodox streak of dividend hikes, but that streak stopped earlier this year. It’s not ideal. Nor is the fact that AESI shares have been hammered to the tune of 45% this year. Again, energy services haven’t had a great 2025, but Atlas has been downright miserable amid slower-than-expected U.S. completion activity and droopy frac-sand prices. If there’s any silver lining to that, it’s that AESI shares now trade at just 5.7 times estimates for cash flows, as well as an attractive PEG of 0.75. The dividend at least appears to be safe, too. While things look bad from an adjusted earnings perspective ($1.00 in dividends annually vs. forecasts for just 25 cents this year), Atlas has more than enough FCF to cover the payout. Example: Last quarter, it generated $48.9 million in adjusted FCF while paying out $30.9 million. Those cash flows are substantial because AESI is a low-cost operator—crucial for survival in this industry. But like any energy services provider, Atlas needs commodity prices to cooperate. It’s unusual for a blue-chip stock like United Parcel Service (UPS, 7.5%) to yield north of 7%, but it’s also rare for a blue-chip stock like UPS to have its shares hemorrhage so much without a recession or broader bear market. Lower-margin e-commerce volumes, higher costs because of its unionized workforce, and a weak freight environment hampered the company in 2024. Then in early 2025, it spooked investors with a weak 2025 forecast and announced that—in hopes of shifting away from those lower-margin volumes—it would drastically reduce its business with Amazon (AMZN), which accounted for roughly 10%-12% of annual UPS revenues. The April tariff announcement also hit shares hard. The result? UPS shares have lost nearly half of their value in just two years. The upshot? UPS trades at roughly 8 times cash-flow estimates and has never offered a better yield in its 26 years of trading. Is UPS a dividend trap? Perhaps. The company pulled its full-year revenue and profit forecasts in April, and didn’t bring them back in its late July report. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a roughly 15% drop in adjusted earnings, to $6.61 per share. That specific number matters: UPS has a target dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% of prior-year adjusted EPS. It currently pays $6.56 across four quarterly dividends. (That’s 99%!) CEO Carol Tomé continued to signal commitment to the dividend in the earnings call—“UPS is rock-solid strong and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet,” she said—but if the delivery giant continues to struggle, simple numbers might force management’s hand. Western Union (WU, 11.3% yield), somehow, is still in business. Payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle have been taking business from the “OG” of money transfer. WU boasts a big yield but for the wrong reason—its divvie looks big because shares are (deservedly) way down! WU, to its credit, has launched an initiative called “Evolve 2025” in which it’s rolling out new products, improvements and an operational efficiency program. It’s also expanding its digital wallet offerings in Mexico and Singapore. And its latest move, announced just a couple days ago, is the $500 million acquisition of Miami-based International Money Express (IMXI), aka Intermex, which serves some 6 million customers who send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany to more than 60 countries. But c’mon man—this dog is dead. The business trades for 4x cash flow and a sub-5 forward P/E, but who cares? Not me. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

The experts also spotted exploitable weaknesses in its infrastructure that defenders can exploit to disrupt campaigns. “Its earliest versions were built using the leaked Cerberus source code, and by late 2023, version 2.0 had incorporated large portions of the Hook botnet’s codebase. The newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications.” reads the report published by Hunt.io. Researchers from ThreatFabric first discovered ERMAC in July 2021, the initial version was almost fully based on the popular banking trojan Cerberus. The source code of Cerberus was released in September 2020 on underground hacking forums after its operators failed an auction. According to the experts, ERMAC is operated by DukeEugene, the threat actor behind the BlackRock mobile malware. The leak of the ERMAC 3.0 code exposed flaws like hardcoded secrets, static tokens, and weak credentials. Version 3.0 supports new injection methods, a C2 panel, Android backdoor, and AES-CBC comms, confirming ERMAC as an active MaaS platform. “ERMAC primarily leverages form injects for capturing sensitive data, which is done by serving custom form injects through the public/injects directory.” continues the post. “ERMAC targets primarily financial applications with a large focus on mobile banking and cryptocurrency applications with it, capturing sensitive data such as login credentials or credit card data.” Hunt.io discovered the full ERMAC V3.0 source code on an open directory on 141[.]164[.]62[.]236. The leak includes backend (PHP/Laravel C2), frontend (React), Golang exfiltration server, Docker configs, and builder. Analysis showed extensive operator control via form injects targeting 700+ apps, mainly banking and crypto, exfiltrating credentials via Android callbacks. Researchers uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, including a hardcoded JWT, default root credentials, and open registration. Panels and exfil servers remain active, confirming ERMAC as an evolving MaaS platform. ERMAC 3.0 relies on the Kotlin backdoor that supports 71 languages and encrypts traffic with AES-CBC. The malware does not target systems in CIS regions and avoid running in emulators. The malicious code requests elevated permissions for its execution, it can exfiltrate device data, and execute extensive commands, from stealing SMS and contacts to pushing fake overlays, call forwarding, Gmail theft, file access, and even taking photos. A web-based builder lets operators customize campaigns. Hunt.io mapped its live C2 panels, APIs, and exfil servers via HuntSQL queries, aiding defenders in tracking and disrupting ERMAC’s infrastructure. “ERMAC targets users of banking, shopping, and other financial applications primarily through web injects. It relies on Android’s WebView API to place an overlay on top of legitimate apps, capturing credentials and payment information. Implementing secure Android permissions such as FLAG_SECURE and using code to detect or block overlays can reduce exposure to this technique.” concludes the report. “Defenders can also focus on identifying and disrupting ERMAC infrastructure. Regularly scan for active C2 and exfiltration servers, and block Android applications that reference known ERMAC IPs or domains.” Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini (SecurityAffairs – hacking, ERMAC 3.0) Data Breach / August 19, 2025 Hacking / August 19, 2025 Security / August 18, 2025 APT / August 16, 2025 Malware / August 15, 2025 To contact me write an email to: Pierluigi Paganini : [email protected] Copyright@securityaffairs 2024

Title: WEF clears founder Schwab of wrongdoing; appoints interim co-chairs

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/16/2025 12:03:12 PM PDT by DFG The World Economic Forum closed an investigation on its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday, clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's (ROG.S), opens new tab vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation. The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him. WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said. -- snip -- In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honored to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation. WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from lives of ordinary people.

Title: Plastics Manufacturing At Crossroads: Pivot To Lead Or Lose
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/trondarneundheim/2025/08/16/plastics-manufacturing-at-crossroads-pivot-to-lead-or-lose/

ByTrond Arne Undheim ByTrond Arne Undheim, Contributor. The latest UN plastics treaty collapse underscored what markets already know: a $400 billion stranded asset risk that forward-thinking petrochemical leaders must now confront strategically. While legacy producers viewed blocking production caps as protecting industry interests, market forces don’t wait for diplomatic consensus. The transition window for plastics producers and pushers alike is narrowing, and who controls that transformation will determine market winners for the next three decades. The plastics industry faces mounting exposure across financial, regulatory, and reputational dimensions. The data reveals systemic vulnerabilities: only 9% of plastic waste is successfully recycled globally, microplastics now contaminate human blood as confirmed by groundbreaking research, and current projections show plastic production almost tripling by 2060. Meanwhile, oil majors increasingly depend on petrochemicals as their primary growth hedge against transport electrification. This isn't environmental ideology—it's risk management. Carbon Tracker has identified $400 billion in planned petrochemical expansions built on assumptions of infinite demand growth, while regulatory reality tells a different story. The EU's PPWR mandates 30% recycled content by 2030, California's SB 54 bans non-recyclable packaging, and consumer sentiment has shifted decisively toward sustainability metrics in purchasing decisions. The strategic question isn’t whether to change course, but how to optimize portfolio transition while preserving long-term revenue streams. Legacy models that expose firms to mounting financial, reputational, and regulatory risk need managed evolution, not overnight abandonment. Global investors are increasingly differentiating between high-risk commodity plastics and resilient specialty applications. BlackRock and LGIM now vote against directors of firms failing to address plastic-related risks. Project financing for petrochemical expansions faces enhanced ESG scrutiny, as demonstrated by investor concerns around major Gulf Coast projects. Lloyd's of London's exclusion of microplastic liability coverage signals broader insurance market caution. Firms that move first in rebalancing portfolios toward higher-value, lower-risk applications will secure cheaper access to capital. The market is rewarding strategic repositioning while penalizing commodity exposure—a trend that will only accelerate as ESG integration deepens across global finance. Strategic manufacturers are already rebalancing based on regulatory exposure and long-term demand fundamentals. Rather than wholesale abandonment, smart money is shifting toward value-preservation strategies that target virgin plastic cuts of 20% by 2027 under emerging regulations: High-value durables: Automotive, aerospace, medical, and renewable energy infrastructure applications offer better regulatory protection and margin stability than commodity packaging. PVC and polystyrene exposure: These face accelerating regulatory pressure. IKEA's aggressive phaseout—plastic packaging eliminated for new ranges in 2025, complete elimination by 2028—signals corporate buyer behavior. Strategic exit while assets retain value makes financial sense. Multi-layer films: Major brands are abandoning these recycling-incompatible formats. PepsiCo's 2025 backtrack reveals the credibility gap—slashing virgin plastic cut targets from 20% to 2% while claiming 97% recyclable packaging by 2030. Compare to Unilever's €1 billion investment in reusable packaging systems, already showing 12% cost savings in pilot markets, proving circular models can be profit centers rather than compliance costs. Engineering plastics: Specialty applications provide longer runway and higher barriers to substitution, making them natural portfolio anchors during transition. Petrochemical majors possess unique advantages in commercializing next-generation technologies. While startups develop promising innovations, established players have the balance sheets and engineering capacity to scale them globally. The technology landscape offers adjacency opportunities rather than existential threats: Carbon utilization: CO₂-to-chemicals technologies transform waste streams into feedstock, leveraging existing infrastructure while improving carbon footprints. LanzaTech's UK expansion in 2025 demonstrates how major players can scale these faster than venture-backed newcomers. Advanced recycling: Chemical recycling and enzyme-based depolymerization require the kind of industrial-scale deployment that suits petrochemical engineering capabilities. Carbios' enzyme facility became operational despite 2025 restructuring, while Loop Industries launched Twist resin with a 70,000-ton facility planned. Microbial manufacturing: Cemvita Factory's breakthrough in using engineered microbes to produce industrial chemicals from CO₂ and waste streams could reach commercial scale within the decade, offering petrochemical companies new bio-based production pathways. Feedstock diversification: Bio-based and captured-carbon feedstocks expand the resource base rather than threatening it, creating opportunities for companies with processing expertise and global distribution networks. UBQ Materials' 2025 masterbatch launch exemplifies how waste streams become valuable inputs. The question isn't whether these technologies will scale—it's who will control their commercialization. First-mover advantages in licensing, partnership, and deployment could define the next industrial cycle. Global policy fragmentation creates near-term arbitrage opportunities while markets converge toward sustainability standards. Petrochemical leaders are uniquely positioned to exploit these asymmetries while building transition capabilities: Europe's strict EPR rules reward recycled content expertise. California's packaging restrictions favor mono-material innovation. Emerging markets maintain growth potential for essential applications while developed markets focus on circularity. BP's own Energy Outlook acknowledges that declining oil use in road transport is being offset by increasing petrochemical demand, but smart players are preparing for the eventual policy convergence. This fragmentation won't last indefinitely, but it provides a transition window for companies that invest now in capabilities they'll need globally later. Building circular expertise in sympathetic markets creates competitive advantages when regulations harmonize. Companies that invest now in next-generation sorting systems like TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI for aluminum recovery will be positioned to capture value as feedstock quality requirements increase globally. BP's 2025 Energy Outlook confirms oil demand peaked in 2025 at 102 million barrels per day, with petrochemical demand offsetting transport decline but plateauing by decade's end. As global awareness of environmental justice rises, companies that proactively address community siting, health impacts, and international waste flows will preserve operating licenses and avoid costly litigation. The traditional export of difficult-to-recycle materials to developing nations creates mounting reputational and legal exposure. Forward-thinking companies are investing in domestic circular systems while partnering with international communities rather than simply relocating problems. This isn't just ethical positioning—it's risk mitigation against consumer boycotts, investor flight, and regulatory backlash as environmental justice movements gain political influence. ESG reporting has become performance theater designed to deflect rather than direct real change. The metrics that matter for survival cut through the noise: annual virgin plastic reduction percentages, microplastic leakage per product unit, and community impact assessments that resist superficial disclosure games. Companies serious about transformation are adopting cradle-to-cradle design principles, where materials flow in closed loops rather than linear waste streams. They're licensing breakthrough technologies rather than developing incrementally. They're building durable license-to-operate through genuine community partnerships. Most importantly, they're setting concrete targets: 20% virgin plastic reduction by 2027, zero microplastic leakage by 2030, and measurable community health improvements in production zones. The industry faces three plausible scenarios by 2030, each offering different positioning opportunities: Regulatory Acceleration: Rapid policy convergence around EPR and production limits favors companies with advanced circular capabilities and low-risk portfolio composition. Managed Transition: Gradual policy evolution allows time for technology deployment and market development, rewarding strategic partnerships between petrochemical leaders and innovation companies. Technology Breakthrough: CO₂-to-chemicals, advanced recycling, or bio-feedstock innovations achieve cost parity faster than expected, creating opportunities for early deployment partnerships. In each scenario, petrochemical majors who position themselves as energy-to-materials champions of the 21st century rather than defensive incumbents will capture the largest share of transition value. The companies that lead circular innovation rather than simply comply with it will define the next industrial era. The winning strategy combines managed portfolio evolution with aggressive technology deployment. Rather than abandoning core capabilities, leaders will redeploy them toward sustainable feedstocks, circular business models, and high-value applications that align with rather than fight against regulatory trends. Critically, circular feedstocks expand rather than shrink petrochemical demand pools—they simply change the input sources while leveraging existing processing expertise. By 2030, expect three pivotal shifts that will reshape competitive dynamics: • Policy Convergence: The EU will implement a plastics border adjustment mechanism by the early 2030s, forcing global convergence on recycled content standards and inspiring similar measures in North America and Asia. • Petrostate Reinvention: At least one Gulf petrostate—likely Saudi Arabia or the UAE—will reposition as a global circular hub, investing heavily in CO₂-to-chemicals and advanced recycling to preserve export relevance in a carbon-constrained world. • Innovation Breakthroughs: TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI systems, Carbios' operational enzyme facility, LanzaTech's UK scale-up, and Cemvita's microbial manufacturing platform will achieve commercial scale within five years, redrawing competitive advantage across the value chain. Additionally, Loop Industries' Twist resin launch and UBQ Materials' masterbatch deployment signal industrial breakthrough timing. The transformation won't be driven by treaties alone—capital markets, regulators, and technology innovators are reshaping the rules of industrial survival faster than diplomatic processes ever could. Expect at least one $10 billion petrochemical expansion to be mothballed or canceled under investor pressure before 2030, validating Carbon Tracker's stranded asset thesis. This isn't about corporate virtue signaling—it's about optimizing portfolios for long-term value creation under changing market conditions. The petrochemical industry's inflection point has arrived. Companies can defend obsolete positions, adapt portfolios reactively, or lead the transition and capture first-mover advantages in next-generation materials. The UN's failure created a transition window, not a reprieve. Carbon Tracker research shows the industry is betting its future on demand growth that regulatory and market forces will constrain. The smartest leaders aren't waiting for policy clarity—they're building capabilities that will thrive under any plausible regulatory scenario. The choice is strategic: adapt portfolios now to secure relevance through 2050 and beyond, or risk portfolio stranding as markets evolve. The companies that redeploy petrochemical expertise toward circular systems, sustainable feedstocks, and high-value applications won't just survive the transition—they'll define it. The question is not whether this pivot happens, but which companies seize it first—and which are left behind. The next industrial cycle will be built on resource optimization, not resource depletion. The question is not whether the plastics pivot happens, but which manufacturing companies seize it first—and which are left behind.

Women’s Interprovincial Championships: Leinster 22 Munster 33 Munster put themselves in pole position for a shot at regaining the Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship title following a business-like 33-22 win over Leinster at Energia Park. Playing with a maturity beyond her years, 19-year-old outhalf Caitríona Finn turned in her second player-of-the-match performance in the space of a week as Munster handed the defending champions a rare home defeat. Chisom Ugwueru’s try just before half-time, adding to a quick-fire Chloe Pearse brace either side of the 20-minute mark, had Munster leading 19-10 as they proved clinical with ball in hand. Leinster debutant Vicky Elmes Kinlan’s dazzling opener had certainly raised the decibel level. Yellow cards for forwards Lisa Callan and Jane Neill hampered them, albeit that Kathy Baker was able to cross in the 28th minute. However, Matt Brown’s charges effectively sealed the result when Kate Flannery and Aoife Corey both touched down inside 12 minutes of the restart. Molly Boyne and Katie Whelan replied late on for Leinster, giving them their own bonus point. With back-to-back bonus point victories, and next Saturday’s trip to Ulster still to come, Munster look red-hot favourites for the final in Donnybrook in two weeks’ time. To set up a rematch with their arch rivals, Leinster will need to beat Connacht in Galway next week. Scorers: Leinster: Tries: Vicky Elmes Kinlan, Kathy Baker, Molly Boyne, Katie Whelan; Con: Ellie O’Sullivan Sexton Munster: Tries: Chloe Pearse 2, Chisom Ugwueru, Kate Flannery, Aoife Corey; Cons: Caitríona Finn 4 LEINSTER: Ellie O’Sullivan Sexton (Old Belvedere RFC); Emma Brogan (MU Barnhall RFC), Kathy Baker (Blackrock College RFC), Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC), Maggie Boylan (Blackrock College RFC); Nikki Caughey (Railway Union RFC), Jade Gaffney (Old Belvedere RFC); Aoife Moore (Blackrock College RFC), Lisa Callan (Old Belvedere RFC), Katie Layde (Old Belvedere RFC), Clíodhna Ní Chonchobhair (Blackrock College RFC), Kate Jordan (Blackrock College RFC), Ciara Short (Wicklow RFC), Molly Boyne (Railway Union RFC) (capt), Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC).

Referee: Siobhán Daly (IRFU) Connacht 12 Ulster 7 Second-half tries from replacement Faith Oviawe and Roisin Maher steered a young Connacht team to a gutsy 12-7 win over Ulster at Dexcom Stadium. With 21-year-old captain and player-of-the-match Éabha Nic Dhonnacha leading by example, Emer O’Dowd’s charges recovered from an early deficit to open their win account in this year’s Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship. Ulster’s new centre Siobhán Sheerin thundered over in the ninth minute, raising her side’s hopes of a first victory at this level in two years. They still led 7-0 after half-time, emerging unscathed from Brenda Barr’s sinbinning. Nonetheless, with Connacht’s bench having the desired impact, forwards Oviawe and Maher scored within seven minutes of each other. In addition, Nic Dhonnacha clipped over the first conversion. The hosts, who wore their club socks on their State of Origin day, remained on the front foot and saw out a rousing triumph, putting last week’s disappointing display against Munster to bed. Unfortunately the hard-earned four points came at a cost for Connacht as the luckless Kayla Waldron was stretchered off in her first game since a horrific leg break in April 2024. There was a lot of concern too for Emily Foley who was taken off with an injury late on. Ulster picked up a losing bonus point for their efforts, and will have home advantage against table toppers Munster at Affidea Stadium next Saturday. Connacht remain in Galway, with a place in the final to play for against Leinster, who are two points better off. Scorers: Connacht: Tries: Faith Oviawe, Roisin Maher; Con: Éabha Nic Dhonnacha.

August 16, 2025 12:52 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Aug. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Title: Nothing to See Here: World Economic Forum Internal Investigation Clears Founder Klaus Schwab of Wrongdoing
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/08/16/nothing-to-see-here-world-economic-forum-internal-investigation-clears-founder-klaus-schwab-of-wrongdoing/
Time Published: 2025-08-16T16:31:09Z
Full Content:
An internal investigation conducted by the World Economic Forum has determined that there was no evidence that founder and former chairman Klaus Schwab committed wrongdoing during his time at the helm of the top globalist institution. Amid stepping down as chairman of the WEF in April, Great Reset architect Klaus Schwab faced accusations from whistleblowers of misconduct, including using World Economic Forum funds to pay for in-room massages in hotels, having staff withdraw WEF money from ATMs for his personal use, and using the organisation’s global competitivesness report to “curry favour” with certain governments. The 87-year-old German-born economist denied all allegations and reportedly launched a lawsuit against the whistleblowers. In response, the WEF hired the Swiss law firm Homburger as well as the American Covington & Burling firm to carry out an internal investigation into Schwab. Announcing the findings of the probe on Friday, the organisation said, according to the Financial Times: “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct.” The WEF board went on to say that it sought to “address all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general”. For his part, the former chairman said he was “pleased that today’s decision lays the foundation for the WEF to continue contributing to the positive development of our society in the future, mindful of its more than 50-year history”. Meanwhile, the WEF named U.S. billionaire BlackRock ceo Larry Fink and Hoffmann-La Roche vice-chairman André Hoffmann as interim chairmen of the board as it seeks a permanent replacement for Schwab. The pair said that they plan on “reinventing and strengthening the forum as an indispensable institution for public-private co-operation”. Originally founded as the European Management Forum in 1971 by then relatively unknown Geneva professor Schwab, with just $6,000 in startup funds, the World Economic Forum has gone on to become one of the most influential NGOs on the planet, with world leaders and heads of industry flocking every year to its annual conference in the Swiss ski town of Davos. Under Schwab’s leadership, the WEF became a leading promoter of an array of globalist projects, including carbon taxes, central bank digital currencies, global governance, tech censorship, transhumanism, and veganism, among others. Schwab also famously coined the concept of a “Great Reset” of global capitalism in which so-called “social justice” would shape decision-making about the world’s economy rather than simple market forces.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Oliver Michael, the CEO of Tokentus, has again provided a bullish outlook for XRP. This time, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $13 and outlined factors that could serve as catalysts for this significant price surge. Oliver Michael predicted in an interview that XRP could rally to $13 at some point if it sustained its current bullish momentum. He alluded to the Ripple SEC lawsuit, which just concluded and how it could spark several ripple effects, which would act as catalysts for the next leg up for the third-largest crypto by market cap. One of these ripple effects is the potential approval of the XRP ETFs. Michael noted that the SEC can now go on to approve these funds since the legal battle against Ripple is over. Furthermore, he raised the possibility of BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF and indicated that the altcoin is likely to record a parabolic rally if this happens, considering BlackRock’s position as the world’s largest asset manager. It is worth noting that BlackRock has said that it has no plans to file for an XRP ETF at the moment. However, XRP lawyer John Deaton believes that the world’s largest asset manager will still file to offer this fund within a year from now. If so, this could drive significant inflows into the XRP ecosystem, considering the success that the firm has recorded with its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, Oliver Michael also expects more Ripple partners to emerge now that the SEC lawsuit is over. This will help enhance XRP’s utility as more companies adopt Ripple’s payment services. Notably, the crypto firm has also made great strides to expand its presence globally by acquiring platforms like the stablecoin platform Rail and brokerage firm Hidden Road. Another reason why the Tokentus CEO believes that XRP can reach this $13 price level is based on his expectation that retail investors will develop a greater interest in the altcoin now that Bitcoin and Ethereum have already pumped significantly. Therefore, they will turn to XRP as the third-largest crypto, which may have more upside than BTC and ETH. Michael remarked that XRP’s move to the upside could happen really fast, similar to its rally of over 300% from below $1 to $3 last year. The altcoin already rallied to as high as $3.6 this year, boasting a 33% year-to-date (YTD) gain. However, based on Michael’s prediction, the XRP price could still reach new highs in the coming months. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.10, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Why The ‘Buy Europe’ Trade Is About To Slam Into A Wall

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Remember a few months ago, when the “buy Europe” trade was red hot? Well, if you’re like me, you’re wondering where all the hype went! Now “buy America” is back on, but European markets are still sky-high—well ahead of their American cousins. That spells trouble for anyone with a portfolio that’s still tilted too much toward Europe. So today we’re going to look into where things are headed (hint: back to the US in a big way!). We’ll also delve into three funds with European exposure (two of which are closed-end funds sporting double-digit dividends) that I urge you to hold off on now. The Financial Times was one of many outlets cheerleading a shift to Europe from America back in the spring. At the time, this sentiment was driven by tariffs, seemingly overextended US tech stocks and surging US markets. “There’s all sorts of reasons to like Europe, all sorts of reasons to hate the US,” contributor Katie Martin said in an April 25 FT podcast. The buy Europe trade was working well as recently as June, when the FT again reported that “European small-caps outshine US rivals as investors bet on growth revival.” Note the phrase growth revival here: The idea was that European stocks were overlooked and would gain attention when their earnings grew. Except that didn’t happen, with European firms posting disappointing earnings, as shown in the table below (more on this in a moment). Meanwhile in the US, companies saw 9% year-over-year earnings gains in Q2, meaning their average profit growth was much higher than the best sector in Europe (financials). And if you compare the best sector in the US—communication services (see chart below), which includes firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Netflix (NFLX)—to its cousins in Europe, the difference is staggering. As you can see at left above, the US sector’s 40.7% earnings growth is many times greater than the best European companies can produce. Meantime, Europe’s tech and telecom companies combined can’t even muster more than 1% average growth between them. Where does that leave the European markets? Well, they’re simply not reflecting this reality. With S&P 500 benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)—in purple above—far behind the Vanguard European Stock Index Fund (VGK), in orange, as of this writing, it’s clear, based on our look at earnings, that European stocks are overbought. This makes VGK a fund to avoid. But ETFs aren’t our main focus at CEF Insider. So let’s turn to two CEFs that could face similar pressure. That, by the way, doesn’t mean these are bad funds—quite the contrary. But now is not the time to buy them, as they do have significant European holdings likely to weigh on them in the coming months. The first one is a good example of a fund I’ve liked in the past and will surely like again at some point: the abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (ASGI). This fund yields a rich 11.8%, and its payout has been steady—it’s even moved up recently (though the dividend varies based on management’s assessment of the market and other factors). Moreover, the fund isn’t inherently European—in fact, it has 55% of its portfolio in US stocks, including cornerstone infrastructure players like Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) and NextEra Energy (NEE). Still, it has 22% of its holdings in continental European stocks, plus another 2.6% in the UK. That’s enough to put a drag on the fund’s portfolio when European stocks snap back to reality. Plus there’s ASGI’s rich valuation. ASGI has been riding the enthusiasm about foreign assets, causing its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which was averaging around 12% going into 2025, to evaporate. When European stocks correct, this fund will likely see a discount—and a consequent drop in its share price. Our second, and final, CEF to be wary of now is the PIMCO Income Strategy II Fund (PFN). This corporate-bond fund yields 11.5% and has held its payout steady since the pandemic days of 2021. However, as I write this, PFN trades at a 5.6% premium to NAV. And while it does have about 77% of its portfolio in the US, its largest allocations by country include European nations—France (3.2%), Spain (3%) and Germany (2.4%), to be precise—and Brazil (2.5%), which faces particularly steep tariffs from the US. To be sure, these are conservative allocations, but throw in PFN’s premium and you get a real risk of a pullback, in both the fund’s NAV and its market price, on any significant European selloff. And lower returns, especially in the fund’s NAV, could put pressure on PFN’s payout. The bottom line on all three of these funds? While geographic diversification is key for any portfolio, it’s only a matter of time until European stocks drop to reflect their meager earnings growth. Until European firms start booking bigger profits, we’re best to look elsewhere for growth. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: SoundHound’s millionaire boss founded 3 software startups before even graduating—he tells Gen Z who want to be their own boss ‘throw darts randomly’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/16/soundhound-ai-ceo-keyvan-mohajer-founder-stanford-dorm-room-entrepreneuer-gen-z-throw-darts-randomly-key-to-success/
Time Published: 2025-08-16T11:17:00Z
Full Content:
Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As someone who immigrated from Iran at age 17 knowing little English, becoming a tech entrepreneur one day may have seemed like a far-fetched dream. But Keyvan Mohajer always kept the mindset: You cannot hit big unless you try. And try he did. By the time he walked across the stage at the University of Toronto to receive his bachelor’s degree in engineering, Mohajer already had three software companies to his name. Each later became profitable and helped seed the voice-AI project he began in his Stanford dorm room in 2004—which evolved into SoundHound AI. Today, the AI-voice communication company is worth more than $6.5 billion and has landed deals with clients including Nvidia, Snapchat, Mercedes-Benz, and more. For Mohajer, who serves as CEO, failure has only ever served as motivation. And, it’s a lesson Gen Z eager to launch side gigs can learn from: The willingness to go out on a limb and build a company from scratch may sound intimidating—but it only takes one good idea to explode into major success. “Every attempt, you should think of it as this is the one that’s going to succeed… Don’t just throw darts randomly at the target. For every attempt, you should use everything you’ve learned from past attempts and then there will be one that’s going to get the bullseye,” Mohajer tells Fortune. Mohajer grew up always fascinated by two things: movies and robots. So, after first seeing Star Trek, he always dreamed of how to bring computerized voice systems into the real world. But only after meeting his later cofounders, James Hom and Majid Emami, during his Stanford electrical engineering doctoral program did he realize he could be part of the team to make it a reality. Their first product was simple: query by humming. Two weeks prior to Christmas, the team didn’t leave their dorm room until they could build a product that could take their database of 20,000 media files and detect what song was being hummed. But by December 24, the code was cracked.“It was on Christmas Eve that I finally hummed this Godfather soundtrack, and it told me, ‘You’re singing The Godfather,’” he said to the Iranian Students of California’s The Tale of a Success series. His pitch to investors became simple: AI-powered voice is the future. “In 20 years we will talk to computers and they will talk back to us and that will change computing.” And while it took years for SoundHound to get up off the ground, he tells Fortune finding his passion, or what makes his “heart beat faster,” has been core to his success today. “You can do things and go through life and get by and check boxes and be average,” he says. “But I really wanted to be excellent, and I wanted to push boundaries. I want to go to places others haven’t gone before, and that gave me the drive to be an entrepreneur and just push the limits and combining the two.” While SoundHound’s market performance has had dramatic ebbs and flows, the stock price is up over 200% in the past year. This is thanks in part to a better-than-expected earnings report from earlier this month; the company’s revenue is up 217% year-over-year. Its market cap is over $6.5 billion. At a time when college students are questioning the value of a degree, SoundHound’s founding story is another reminder of the innovation that often spurs across college campuses—even if it is just from cofounders meeting for the first time. Companies such as Databricks, a $62 billion data software company, as well as Google, worth over $2.4 trillion, also planted roots in college. Both sets of founders met on Stanford’s campus. But there perhaps is no more famous company that spurred from the college experience than Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg met his cofounders, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes at Harvard University and built the foundation of the social platform now known as Meta (now worth nearly $2 trillion). The billionaire returned to his alma mater in 2017 and said he never expected to be such an entrepreneurial success story. “The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us,” Zuckerberg said. “We were just college kids. We didn’t know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it.” “We’ve all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families,” he added. “That’s why I’m so grateful to this place. Thanks, Harvard.” Editor’s note, Aug. 16, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify a quote from CEO Keyvan Mohajer, who misspoke earlier. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: ERMAC V3.0 Banking Trojan Source Code Leak Exposes Full Malware Infrastructure

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of an Android banking trojan called ERMAC 3.0, uncovering serious shortcomings in the operators' infrastructure. "The newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications," Hunt.io said in a report. The latest iteration of the malware can send SMS or initiate phone calls to a phone number, set up call forwarding to a specified number, display custom push notification with, fetch Gmail email subject lines, take pictures using the front camera, launch overlays on top of financial apps, capture contact lists, SMS messages, installed apps, and remove itself from the device. ERMAC was first documented by ThreatFabric in September 2021, detailing its ability to conduct overlay attacks against hundreds of banking and cryptocurrency apps across the world. Attributed to a threat actor named DukeEugene, it's assessed to be an evolution of Cerberus and BlackRock. Other commonly observed malware families – including Hook (ERMAC 2.0), Pegasus, and Loot – possess a shared lineage: An ancestor in the form of ERMAC from which source code components have been passed down and modified through generations. Hunt.io said it managed to obtain the complete source code associated with the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering from an open directory on 141.164.62[.]236:443, right down to its PHP and Laravel backend, React-based frontend, Golang exfiltration server, and Android builder panel. The functions of each of the components are listed below - Besides an expanded set of app targets, ERMAC 3.0 adds new form injection methods, an overhauled command-and-control (C2) panel, a new Android backdoor, and AES-CBC encrypted communications. "The leak revealed critical weaknesses, such as a hardcoded JWT secret and a static admin bearer token, default root credentials, and open account registration on the admin panel," the company said. "By correlating these flaws with live ERMAC infrastructure, we provide defenders with concrete ways to track, detect, and disrupt active operations." Join Karl Henrik Smith from Okta as he reveals how AI is reshaping cybersecurity and why identity is now the ultimate defense against evolving threats.

Title: Follow the signs: vintage advertising brings high estimates at auction
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/08/16/follow-the-signs-vintage-advertising-bring-high-estimates-at-auction/
Time Published: 2025-08-16T10:27:00Z

Advertising signage has a niche market among collectors, who are often willing to pay a few thousand euro for certain pieces of pub and shop memorabilia. Fans of such items should check out the catalogue for the upcoming online-only auction at Victor Mee Auctions based in Cloverhill, Co Cavan, on Tuesday and Wednesday, August 19th and 20th, from 6pm each evening. The auction of more than 1,000 lots is a tribute to a bygone era when advertising was a physical art form in which sign writers and designers honed their skills on metal and glass. One of the most expensive estimates in the auction, at €3,000-€5,000, is for a mirror advertising Bendigo cigarettes in an art nouveau style. “These mirrors were made as luxury advertising pieces, often displayed in tobacconists, grocers and public houses in the early 1900s,” says Mee. The maker of the mirror with hand-gilded lettering was A&H Pemberton, a Liverpool glass and sign manufacturer. A smaller mirror advertising the same brand went under the hammer at Fonsie Mealy’s auctions for €1,600 in May last year. A more unusual sign advertising the chemical fertiliser, Hibernian Manure (€200-€400), might be of interest to an agricultural museum. Depicting a gentleman farmer engaging with a formally dressed saleswoman, it promises financial success to those who apply it to their land. Such was the importance attributed to promoting their products that in the 1930s, the manufacturers of the fertiliser offered a prize of £3 to anyone who could illustrate scenes that could be used in their advertising. The Victor Mee auction also includes a set of 12 framed advertising prints explaining “The Gentle Art of Making Guinness” (€500-€800). This whimsical series was originally produced by Guinness in the mid-20th century under the creative direction of John Gilroy, the artist behind Guinness’s most iconic campaigns. At an online auction set to take place on Saturday, August 30th, Lynes & Lynes auction rooms in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, also have some old advertising signs from Musgrave Brothers depicting scenes of Cork, such as the Metropole Hotel on MacCurtain Street (€60-€100 each). “The printed sign shows the Musgrave Brothers’ head office on Cornmarket Street and at the base it shows the Metropole Hotel, with the Musgrave sweet factory behind. These are old signs and we expect good Cork interest,” says Denis Lynes. The auction also has some noteworthy historic pieces of furniture from Montenotte House in Cork city. Montenotte House is a Georgian end-terrace home with magnificent views over the river Lee from the city’s sought-after southern suburb of the same name. There is also a selection of 26 antique dolls (€100-€200 each) up for auction. Viewing of items runs from Saturday, August 23rd, to Friday, August 29th, from 10am-5pm daily. An interest in buying antiques and art often coincides with an interest in local history, so many buyers and sellers will no doubt be considering attending some events during National Heritage Week, which begins on August 16th. The free talks – in person and online – from the Crawford Art Gallery about the conservation of The Goose Girl by Edith Somerville (1858-1949) will be of interest to collectors of historic paintings. Somerville’s painting – not to be confused with the National Gallery’s Goose Girl painting, originally believed to be by Irish artist William Leech but later confirmed to have been painted by English artist Stanley Royle – depicts a young west Cork girl sitting on the floor holding a goose. Looking particularly sad, she is surrounded by vegetables and cooking utensils, which give the impression that the goose is destined for a tasty dinner. Somerville was born on the Greek island of Corfu but spent much of her life in Castletownshend in west Cork. Her painting echoed the French peasant realism style of the era. Although better known as one half of writing duo, Somerville and Ross, Somerville was also an accomplished artist, a suffragist and a progressive farmer who introduced the first herd of Friesian cattle to Ireland. The painting – which is one of the Crawford art gallery’s most popular – is now in need of crucial conservation work. Italian conservator Chiara Chillè, registrar Jean O’Donovan and curator Michael Waldron will explain the processes involved in talks being held on Tuesday, August 19thb at 1pm at the Civic Trust House in Cork City, and online on Wednesday, August 20th at 1pm. The Crawford Art Gallery closed to the public in September 2024 for major redevelopment but events such as these aim to keep the public connected to the collections therein. Meanwhile, Ann Chumbley, the collections registrar for the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny, will give a behind-the-scenes look at how to care and conserve art works at the gallery on Tuesday, 1pm-2.30pm. victormeeauctions.ie lynesandlynes.com heritageweek.ie Estimate £3,000-£4,000 Hammer price £3,900 (€4,508) Auction house Ross’s Auctioneers Estimate €400-€500 Hammer price €952 Auction house Adams Blackrock Estimate €850-€950 Hammer price €2,024 Auction house Adams Blackrock Estimate €300-€400 Hammer price €500 Auction house Adams Blackrock Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

It makes sense: Critics say his social networks are bad for your mental health; he’s aggressively hiring people across Silicon Valley to staff up his ambitious AI projects (which are, unto themselves, polarizing); and he owns wide swaths of land in Hawaii, which has rankled residents and activists alike. It makes sense that he might want to shield his livelihood, considering he’s almost certainly the target of public ire. According to a new Financial Times analysis, security budgets for the chief executives of 10 major tech companies climbed above $45 million in 2024—but still, nobody protects their boss more than Meta does for Zuckerberg. Across the board, companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, and Palantir all increased protection budgets by more than 10% year over year, driven by heightened threats and a worsening security environment for public-facing business leaders. But Meta’s security allocation for Zuckerberg reached more than $27 million in 2024, up from $24 million the previous year. This dwarfs the amount spent by peers: In 2024, Nvidia spent $3.5 million to secure CEO Jensen Huang, an increase from $2.2 million the previous year. Amazon allocated $1.1 million for CEO Andy Jassy, while former CEO Jeff Bezos continued to receive $1.6 million annually toward his personal security. Apple spent $1.4 million to protect Tim Cook in 2024, which was actually lower than the $2.4 million spent in 2023. Alphabet’s security spending for Sundar Pichai reached $6.8 million, according to public data, and Tesla disclosed it spent just $500,000 to protect Elon Musk, although industry experts emphasize that this sum represents only a small portion of his actual security expenses as the world’s richest man has his own security companies like Foundation Security. Notably, if you add up how much Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks spent protecting their CEOs in 2024, it’s still about $7 million—26%—less than what Meta spent to guard Zuckerberg. For what it’s worth, Meta’s security program is a bit different from the others as it covers Zuckerberg’s residences, family, and travel, since Zuckerberg is synonymous with Meta, né Facebook. As both CEO and cofounder, he also holds majority voting power—and a lot of people have strong feelings about Zuckerberg given his very public role in society, layoffs, and consumer privacy. Security in Silicon Valley is often managed by private security firms, many of which are staffed by former law enforcement and military professionals. Hamilton Security, founded by former FBI agent James Hamilton, provides comprehensive assessments and risk mitigation services. Gavin de Becker & Associates and LaSorsa & Associates are also considered major players, protecting executives like Musk and Bezos, respectively. Their services include risk assessment, intelligence monitoring, residential security with hardened features (e.g., Amazon’s bulletproof panels), 24/7 personal protective details, secure transportation, cybersecurity, anti-stalking measures, as well as preparation for assassination attempts, kidnap attempts, and digital threats such as deepfakes. Palantir’s Alex Karp, for example, who runs a data-intelligence company with controversial defense contracts, employs a 24/7 security detail with up to four visible bodyguards. Nvidia’s Huang, who nabbed the top spot on Fortune’s Most Powerful People in Business list this year, saw a rise in his protection budget as his net worth soared and global profile increased, including reports of being mobbed by fans. The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December led to some of the rising spend among executives, but it forced some protocol changes as well. Some companies have removed photos of leadership from their corporate websites, invested in home defenses and cyber protection, and enforced stricter travel policies: Lockheed Martin, for example, mandates its CEO use corporate jets. Meta did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment on its security spend for Zuckerberg. For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Title: Stop using AI for these 9 work tasks - here's why

A few weeks ago, I shared with you "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI - and why." It's full of well-reasoned suggestions and recommendations for how to avoid having an AI produce code that could ruin your whole day. Then, my editor and I got talking, and we realized the whole idea of "when not to use an AI" could apply to work in general. In this article, I present to you nine things you shouldn't use AI for while at work. This is far from a comprehensive list, but it should make you think. Also: This one feature could make GPT-5 a true game changer (if OpenAI gets it right) "Always keep in mind that AI isn't going to read you your Miranda Rights, wrap your personal information in legal protections like HIPAA, or hesitate to disclose your secrets," said LinkedIn Learning AI instructor Pam Baker, the bestselling author of ChatGPT For Dummies and Generative AI For Dummies. "That goes double for work AI, which is monitored closely by your employer. Whatever you do or tell AI can and likely will be used against you at some point." To keep things interesting, read on to the end. There, I share some fun and terrifying stories about how using AI at work can go terribly, horribly, and amusingly wrong. Without further ado, here are nine things you shouldn't do with AI at work. This is an easy one. Every time you give the AI some information, ask yourself how you would feel if it were posted to the company's public blog or wound up on the front page of your industry's trade journal. Also: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use) This concern also includes information that might be subject to disclosure regulations, such as HIPAA for health information or GDPR for personal data for folks operating in the EU. Regardless of what the AI companies tell you, it's best to simply assume that everything you feed into an AI is now grist for the model-training mill. Anything you feed in could later wind up in a response to somebody's prompt, somewhere else. Contracts are designed to be detailed and specific agreements on how two parties will interact. They are considered governing documents, which means that writing a bad contract is like writing bad code. Baaad things will happen. Do not ask AIs for help with contracts. They will make errors and omissions. They will make stuff up. Worse, they will do so while sounding authoritative, so you're more likely to use their advice. Also: You can use Google's Math Olympiad-winning Deep Think AI model now - for a price Also, the terms of a contract are often governed by the contract. In other words, many contracts say that what's actually in the contract is confidential, and that if you share the particulars of your agreement with any outside party, there will be dire consequences. Sharing with an AI, as discussed above, is like publishing on the front page of a blog. Let me be blunt. If you let an AI work on a contract and it makes a mistake, you (not it) will be paying the price for a long, long time. You know the trope where what you share with your lawyer is protected information and can't be used against you? Yeah, your friendly neighborhood AI is not your lawyer. As reported in Futurism, OpenAI CEO (and ChatGPT's principal cheerleader) Sam Altman told podcaster Theo Von that there is no legal confidentiality when using ChatGPT for your legal concerns. Also: Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks you shouldn't trust AI for therapy Earlier, I discussed how AI companies might use your data for training and embed that data in prompt responses. However, Altman took this assertion up a notch. He suggested OpenAI is obligated to share your conversations with ChatGPT if they are subpoenaed by a court. Jessee Bundy, a Knoxville-based attorney, amplified Altman's statement in a tweet: "There's no legal privilege when you use ChatGPT. So if you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking it for strategy, you're not getting legal advice. You're generating discoverable evidence. No attorney/client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you." She summed up her observations with a particularly damning statement: "It might feel private, safe, and convenient. But lawyers are bound to protect you. ChatGPT isn't, and can be used against you." While we're on the topic of guidance, let's hit two other categories where highly trained, licensed, and regulated professionals are available to provide advice: healthcare and finance. Look, it's probably fine to ask ChatGPT to explain a medical or financial concept to you as if you were a five-year-old. But when it comes time to ask for real advice that you plan on considering as you make major decisions, just don't. Let's step away from the liability risk issues and focus on common sense. First, if you're using something like ChatGPT for real advice, you have to know what to ask. If you're not trained in these professions, you might not know. Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out Second, ChatGPT and other chatbots can be spectacularly, overwhelmingly, and almost unbelievably wrong. They misconstrue questions, fabricate answers, conflate concepts, and generally provide questionable advice. Ask yourself, are you willing to bet your life or your financial future on something that a people-pleasing robot made up because it thought that's what you wanted to hear? When you ask a chatbot to write something for you, do you claim it as your own? Some folks have told me that because they wrote the prompts, the resulting output is a result of their creativity. Also: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time Yeah? Not so much. Webster's defines "plagiarize" as "to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own," and to "use (another's production) without crediting the source." The dictionary also defines plagiarize as "to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source." Does that not sound like what a chatbot does? It sure does "present as new and original an idea…derived from an existing source." Chatbots are trained on existing sources. They then parrot back those sources after adding a bit of spin. Let's be clear. Using an AI and saying its output is yours could cost you your job. The other day, I had a technical question about my Synology server. I filed a support ticket after hours. A bit later, I got an email response from a self-identified support AI. The cool thing was that the answer was complete and just what I needed, so I didn't have to escalate my ticket to a human helper. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction But not all AI interactions with customers go that well. Even a year and a half later, I'm still chuckling about the Chevy dealer chatbot that offered a $55,000 Chevy Tahoe truck to a customer for a buck. It's perfectly fine to provide a trained chatbot as one support option to customers. But don't assume it's always going to be right. Ensure customers have the option to talk with a human. And monitor the AI-enabled process. Otherwise, you could be giving away $1 trucks, too. According to a survey by resume-making app Resume Builder, a majority of managers are using AI "to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and even terminations (64%)." "Why are you firing me?" "It's not my fault. The AI made me do it." Yeah, that. Worse, apparently at least 20% of managers, most of whom haven't been trained in the rights and wrongs of AI usage, are using AIs to make final employment decisions without even bothering to oversee the AI. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking But here's the rub. Jobs are often governed by labor laws. Despite the current anti-DEI push coming from Washington, bias can still lead to discrimination lawsuits. Even if you haven't technically done anything wrong, defending against a lawsuit can be expensive. If you cause your company to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit because you couldn't be bothered to be human enough to double-check why your AI was canning Janice in accounting, you'll be the next one being handed a pink slip. Don't do it. Just say no. I'm going to tell you a little secret. Journalists and writers do not exist solely to promote your company. We'd like to help, certainly. It feels good knowing we're helping folks grow their businesses. But, and you'll need to sit down for this news, there are other companies. We are also busy. I get thousands of emails every day. Hundreds of them are about the newest and by far most innovative AI company ever. Many of those pitches are AI-generated because the PR folks couldn't be bothered to take the time to focus their pitch. Some of them are so bad that I can't even tell what the PRs are trying to hawk. But then, there's the other side. Sometimes, I'll reach out to a company, willing to use my most valuable resource -- time -- on their behalf. When I get back a response that's AI-driven, I'll either move on to the next company (or mock them on social media). Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon Some of those AI-driven answers are really, really inappropriate. However, because the AI is representing the company instead of, you know, maybe a thinking human, an opportunity is lost. Keep in mind that I don't like publishing things that will cost someone their job. But other writers are not necessarily similarly inclined. A properly run business will not only use a human to respond to the press, but will also limit the humans allowed to represent the company to those properly experienced in what to say. Or go ahead and cut corners. I always need fun fodder for my Facebook feed. Earlier, I wrote "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI," which detailed programming tasks you should avoid passing along to an AI. I've long been nervous about ceding too much responsibility to an AI, and quite concerned about managing codebase maintenance. But I didn't really understand how far stupid could go when it came to delegating coding responsibility to the AI. I mean, yes, I know AIs can be stupid. And I sure know humans can be stupid. But when AIs and humans work in tandem to advance the cause of their stupidity together, the results can be truly awe-inspiring. In "Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster," my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols wrote about a developer who happily vibe-coded himself to an almost-complete piece of software. First, the AI hard-coded lies about how unit tests performed. Then the AI deleted his entire codebase. It's not necessarily wrong to use AI to help you code. But if you're using a tool that can't be backed up, or you don't bother to back up your code first, you're simply doing your best to earn a digital Darwin award. Here's a lightning round of boneheaded moves using AI. They're just too good (and by good, I mean bad) not to recount: What about you? Have you seen an AI go off the rails at work? Have you ever been tempted to delegate a task to a chatbot that, in hindsight, probably needed a human touch? Do you trust AI to handle sensitive data, communicate with customers, or make decisions that affect people's lives? Where do you draw the line in your work? Let us know in the comments below.

Business Economy August 16, 2025 BlackRock's Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, alongside Andre Hoffmann. The forum aims to drive international collaboration and distribute prosperity more broadly, says the newly appointed co-chairs. The WEF board cleared founder Klaus Schwab and Hilde Schwab of any misconduct following an investigation. Klaus Schwab founded the World Economic Forum, initially the European Management Forum, in 1971 as a corporate management symposium. “The world is more fragmented and complex than ever,” said the new co-chairmen in a joint statement. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which organises the annual meeting of leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss based healthcare company Roche Holding, will also be interim co-chairman of the WEF, according to an announcement on Friday. “The world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government, and civil society has never been greater,” Mr Fink and Mr Hoffmann said in a joint statement. “We remain optimistic. The forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly.” "This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally," they said. Both Mr Fink and Mr Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF’s board before being appointed to the current position. The latest announcement comes as global economy feels the impact of geopolitical matters and the rise in protectionism fostered by the introduction of US tariffs. US President Donald Trump shook the world economy following his April 2 "liberation day" announcement, with new tariffs. A number of leaders from the world of business and politics attend the forum every year. Mr Trump addressed the forum online this year. The board of trustees of the WEF cleared founder Klaus Schwab of any “material wrongdoing” following an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers. “Following a thorough review of all facts, the board has concluded that, while the organisation must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,” the WEF said in the statement. It also cleared Hilde Schwab, wife of Mr Schwab, of any misconduct. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,” the WEF said. “The board has taken action to address all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general.” Mr Schwab started what became the World Economic Forum – initially called the European Management Forum – in 1971 as a symposium on corporate management. Since then, the event grew to become an annual gathering of about 2,500 corporate executives, financiers, and politicians, and other public figures from more than 100 countries, addressing matters such as inequality, migration, digital innovation and globalisation. With strong ties with leading organisations such as the UN and World Bank, the WEF has played a major role in navigating political issues and promoting a collaborative approach to global trade. Mr Schwab stepped down as head of board of trustees of the WEF in April this year.

The World Economic Forum has cleared Klaus Schwab of “material wrongdoing” after a law firm conducted a review into potential misconduct of the institution’s founder. The body also said Blackrock Inc.’s Larry Fink and Roche Holding AG vice chairman Andre Hoffmann will take over the leadership of the WEF board of trustees on an interim basis as co-chairs, according to a statement late Friday. Interim chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe is stepping down. “Following a thorough review of all facts, the Board has concluded that, while the organization must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,” it said in the statement. The board also said there is no evidence of any misconduct by Hilde Schwab, the wife of Klaus. The announcement ends a fight between the founder of the iconic institution and its board that was triggered by reports about potential misconduct by Klaus Schwab. Schwab abruptly resigned from the WEF in April after the misconduct allegations emerged, sparking the clash. The body launched an investigation to examine a range of accusations, including claims the 87-year-old used the forum’s resources for personal purposes. The dispute escalated when Schwab accused the WEF’s board of leaking details of an investigation against him to the media, complicating a peace agreement between the two parties. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,” the WEF said in its statement, pledging to improve its governance. Fink and Roche heir Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF’s board. The organization’s flagship event, the annual Davos meeting, has emerged into a must-attend event for bankers, business figures and politicians over the decades. The next gathering will take place in January 2026. “We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,” Fink and Hoffmann said in a joint statement.

World World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab speaks at the WEF's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21, 2025. (File photo: AP/Markus Schreiber) The World Economic Forum (WEF) closed an investigation into its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday (Aug 15), clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation. The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him. WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probe in April, had said an anonymous letter raised concerns about the WEF's governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the forum's resources without proper oversight. In May, a spokesperson for Schwab informed Reuters that he had filed a criminal complaint against the whistleblowers. The Schwab family denied all the allegations in the whistleblower complaint to the Journal. Following the conclusion of the probe, a spokesman for Schwab told WSJ on Friday that he intends to drop his lawsuit against WEF and a separate legal action against anonymous whistleblowers. The WEF also said Peter Brabeck-Letmathe had stepped down as interim chairman following the investigation’s conclusion. In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honoured to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation. WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from the lives of ordinary people.

Posted on 08/15/2025 3:48:01 PM PDT by xzins The Russiagate Releases Were Organized in Advance of this Summit August 15, 2025 | Sundance While it may be frustrating to many people to realize most of the Russiagate declassification and releases of information are not intended to generate indictments or legal accountability, on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset. Arguably, the Russiagate releases can be looked upon as intentionally strategic, or just surreptitiously timed. The opposition to this discussion, meeting, peace effort and potential strategic realignment, includes: The CIA, NATO, the U.K, British intelligence (GCHQ), Five-Eyes, the European Union, China, BRICS, Ukraine, World Bank, Wall Street, the military industrial complex, Blackrock and global leftists. If President Trump and President Putin can overcome all those in opposition to their unity and still form a strategic alliance, the entire world changes. This cannot be overstated.

They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun. Obama and company are not going to escape God's justice. 6 posted on 08/15/2025 4:37:20 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins Sundance is correct as usual.

This lays the groundwork for the public to be familiar with the WHY and HOW when the Grand Jury indictments are issued. If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy. Proving their guilt to the public and then leaving it hanging would be disastrous. It would embolden those that did wrong and those who would be tempted to do similar wrongs in the future. At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, “we are building a case for the American public“… There it is.LOL.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: FreeReign; GLDNGUN President Trump Outlines a Remarkably Altruistic IntentionAugust 16, 2025 | Sundance Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day’s events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence!

This lays the groundwork for the public to be familiar with the WHY and HOW when the Grand Jury indictments are issued. If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy. Proving their guilt to the public and then leaving it hanging would be disastrous. It would embolden those that did wrong and those who would be tempted to do similar wrongs in the future. At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, “we are building a case for the American public“… There it is.LOL.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose.

Posted on 08/15/2025 3:48:01 PM PDT by xzins The Russiagate Releases Were Organized in Advance of this Summit August 15, 2025 | Sundance While it may be frustrating to many people to realize most of the Russiagate declassification and releases of information are not intended to generate indictments or legal accountability, on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset. Arguably, the Russiagate releases can be looked upon as intentionally strategic, or just surreptitiously timed. The opposition to this discussion, meeting, peace effort and potential strategic realignment, includes: The CIA, NATO, the U.K, British intelligence (GCHQ), Five-Eyes, the European Union, China, BRICS, Ukraine, World Bank, Wall Street, the military industrial complex, Blackrock and global leftists. If President Trump and President Putin can overcome all those in opposition to their unity and still form a strategic alliance, the entire world changes. This cannot be overstated.

They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun. Obama and company are not going to escape God's justice. 6 posted on 08/15/2025 4:37:20 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins Sundance is correct as usual.

This lays the groundwork for the public to be familiar with the WHY and HOW when the Grand Jury indictments are issued. If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy. Proving their guilt to the public and then leaving it hanging would be disastrous. It would embolden those that did wrong and those who would be tempted to do similar wrongs in the future. At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, “we are building a case for the American public“… There it is.LOL.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: FreeReign; GLDNGUN President Trump Outlines a Remarkably Altruistic IntentionAugust 16, 2025 | Sundance Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day’s events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible.

This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible.

That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun. Obama and company are not going to escape God's justice. 6 posted on 08/15/2025 4:37:20 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: xzins Sundance is correct as usual.

This lays the groundwork for the public to be familiar with the WHY and HOW when the Grand Jury indictments are issued. If the Trump administration has no intention to do this, it makes no sense to hype it up and get everyone in a frenzy. Proving their guilt to the public and then leaving it hanging would be disastrous. It would embolden those that did wrong and those who would be tempted to do similar wrongs in the future. At the same time, it would be devastating for MAGA. If your DOJ hypes it up, but then doesn't bring charges that means you don't have a case. And if you don't have a case, you can't keep beating that horse. At some point, it's put up or shut up. If Trump had decided to just let the past go, they would be talking about other things and just move on. It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, “we are building a case for the American public“… There it is.LOL.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: FreeReign; GLDNGUN President Trump Outlines a Remarkably Altruistic IntentionAugust 16, 2025 | Sundance Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day’s events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Wegovy® approved in the US for the treatment of MASH

Time Published: 2025-08-15T21:23:00Z
Full Content:
August 15, 2025 17:23 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 15 August 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an additional indication for Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg) based on a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for treatment of noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. The accelerated approval is based on part 1 of the ESSENCE trial, in which Wegovy® demonstrated a statistically significant and superior improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis, as well as resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to placebo. The clinical data from ESSENCE showed that at week 72, 36.8% of people treated with Wegovy® achieved improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis compared to 22.4% treated with placebo. 62.9% of people treated with Wegovy® achieved resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to 34.3% treated with placebo. “Wegovy® is now uniquely positioned as the first and only GLP-1 treatment approved for MASH, complementing the already proven weight loss, cardiovascular benefits and extensive body of evidence linked to semaglutide,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, chief scientific officer and head of Research and Development, at Novo Nordisk. “MASH represents a significant health burden, with one in three people with overweight or obesity worldwide affected. In the US alone, around 22 million people are estimated to live with MASH. With the approval of Wegovy® for MASH, we provide a new treatment to people living with MASH that not only halts the disease activity but helps reverse the damage caused to the liver.” As of today, Wegovy® is available in the US for the treatment for MASH. About MASH Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a serious, progressive, metabolic disease affecting the liver, which can be fatal if not properly managed. More than 250 million people live with MASH and the number of individuals in advanced stages of the disease is expected to double by 2030. Of those who are currently overweight or living with obesity, more than one in three are also living with MASH. People living with MASH often experience few or no specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease, which often results in delayed diagnosis. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver cancer, is higher in people living with MASH than in the general population. About the ESSENCE trial ESSENCE is a phase 3 trial evaluating the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). ESSENCE is a two-part trial where 1,200 planned participants were randomised 2:1 to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, on top of standard of care for 240 weeks. In part 1, the objective was to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg improves liver histology at 72 weeks based on biopsy sampling from the first 800 randomised patients. In part 2, the objective is to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg lowers the risk of liver-related clinical events compared to placebo in adults with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis at 240 weeks. Based on part 1 of the ESSENCE trial, Novo Nordisk has also filed for regulatory approval in the EU in February 2025, with a subsequent filing in Japan in May 2025. Part 2 of the ESSENCE trial is expected to read out in 2029. About Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg) The FDA initially approved Wegovy® in 2021 with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity to help adults with obesity, or adults with excess weight (overweight) who also have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and keep the weight off. The indication was expanded in 2022 to include children aged 12 years and older with obesity. In 2024, Wegovy® was approved to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Today, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Wegovy® for a new patient population for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

Title: World Economic Forum Clears Schwab, Names Fink as Co-Chair

(Bloomberg) -- The World Economic Forum has cleared Klaus Schwab of “material wrongdoing” after a law firm conducted a review into potential misconduct of the institution’s founder. The body also said Blackrock Inc.’s Larry Fink and Roche Holding AG vice chairman Andre Hoffmann will take over the leadership of the WEF board of trustees on an interim basis as co-chairs, according to a statement late Friday. Interim chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe is stepping down. “Following a thorough review of all facts, the Board has concluded that, while the organization must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,” it said in the statement. The board also said there is no evidence of any misconduct by Hilde Schwab, the wife of Klaus. The announcement ends a fight between the founder of the iconic institution and its board that was triggered by reports about potential misconduct by Klaus Schwab. Schwab abruptly resigned from the WEF in April after the misconduct allegations emerged, sparking the clash. The body launched an investigation to examine a range of accusations, including claims the 87-year-old used the forum’s resources for personal purposes. The dispute escalated when Schwab accused the WEF’s board of leaking details of an investigation against him to the media, complicating a peace agreement between the two parties. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,” the WEF said in its statement, pledging to improve its governance. Fink and Roche heir Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF’s board. The organization’s flagship event, the annual Davos meeting, has emerged into a must-attend event for bankers, business figures and politicians over the decades. The next gathering will take place in January 2026. “We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,” Fink and Hoffmann said in a joint statement. (Updates with comments from Fink and Hoffmann in last paragraph, details on the dispute between Klaus Schwab and the WEF throughout) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Posted on August 15, 2025 by Nick Roach 6 Comments Today, we are releasing the first of two batches of WooCommerce modules for Divi 5. This first and more significant batch includes 17 of Divi’s 25 Woo modules, covering all the modules you need to build custom product and category pages. We’ll finish the remaining cart and checkout modules over the next couple of weeks and launch the Public Beta shortly after. Everyone is itching to get their hands on these modules, so we are releasing what’s ready. Check out the following video to see the new feature in action. 👇 If you have been using Divi 5 with WooCommerce, you’ll know that all of Divi’s Woo modules are already available for use in backward compatibility mode and can be found in the Woo folder when adding new modules to a page. With today’s update, you’ll find that most of these modules no longer have the legacy label and will no longer run in backward compatibility mode. The native Divi 5 versions of these modules are faster and easier to use. These modules include: That’s a lot of modules, and only a few remain! The Woo Product module can create lists of products and custom product category pages. To get even more creative, you can use Divi’s new Loop Builder to query WooCommerce products and build product loops of any type and style, breaking free from the Woo Product module’s static structure. Build your loop template, enabling looping, query the product post type, and plug dynamic product data into the loop. The rest of Divi’s Woo modules can create custom product pages. They provide every building block and can be fully customized using Divi’s wide range of design settings. You have complete creative freedom to break free of standard WooCommerce product templates. When it comes to increasing sales, there’s nothing more important than a stunning and compelling product page! Look at some beautiful product pages our design team created using these new modules. Woo product modules are available for Divi 5 today and are one of many features coming to Divi this year. You can follow along as we progress through the final release of Divi 5 and beyond, with updates every two weeks. Depending on your priorities, you can use Divi 5 now to build new websites or wait until we add more features, whatever works best for you. As outlined in Divi 5’s original multi-phase release schedule, the Divi 5 Public Alpha is like “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features and may not be suitable for existing websites, but it’s ready to be used on new websites if you prefer the experience to Divi 4. We want you to try it, and if you love it, use it; when everyone loves it, we’ll make it official. In case you missed it, we recently released three new modules for Divi 5, including the much-requested Group Carousel module. This module allows you to create any type of carousel or slider, including post-based carousels, using Divi 5’s new loop builder. We also added a Lottie module for easy JSON-based animations and an Icon List module for easy list creation. Watch this video for all the details. 👇 2025 is the year of Divi 5. The tedious work is behind us. We built the super-fast foundation, and now it’s time for Divi to make its comeback. If you’re here for the Divi comeback, do us a huge favor and let us know by liking this video and leaving a comment. It means a lot to us to see you cheering Divi on, and it’s essential to feed the algorithm and spread the word. Don’t forget to follow us on YouTube and subscribe to the Divi newsletter so you never miss an update. I’ll see you soon for another Divi 5 feature announcement, which I promise will be right around the corner. 😁 Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts.

When I'm not hard at work on new themes, I enjoy writing an article or two on our blog! Posted on August 8, 2025 in Theme Releases Today, we released three new modules for Divi 5, including the much-requested Group Carousel module, which allows you to create any type of carousel or slider, including post-based carousels, using Divi 5’s new loop builder. We also added a Lottie module for easy JSON-based animations and an Icon... Posted on July 25, 2025 in Theme Releases Today, we introduce Loop Builder Divi 5, which allows you to construct looping post-based and term-based content using any Divi element. Divi’s loop builder is unique in its freedom; you can loop anything without being restricted to a static loop module or container. Build your looping... Updated on July 11, 2025 in Theme Releases Today, we introduce the all-new flexbox-based layout system for Divi 5. This is no minor update. It reinvents Divi, allowing you to build any layout structure, including responsive layout breakdown, custom module ordering, easy vertical alignment and element positioning, and much more. No stone was... Where is the Short form description ? That always been a problem on my side. Is there something about the added details like color, size, etc… is there e render for that block ? The Woo Product Description module displays the short form description. The Woo Product Information module displays product attributes. These are available in Divi 4 and now in Divi 5. Will there be an add to cart button for the products module? Hey, Kay! There are no plans currently to include a Woo Products Module option for the “Add To Cart” button, but it’s an option easy to customize in. We have a guide on the topic: How to Customize the Woo Products Module to Include the “Add to Cart” Button. Hope this helps! 👍 In the video, I heard that the other Woo Modules will be released in the next couple of weeks. Is that still the case? Next question: If developers have been using the Legacy Modules in Divi 5, what happens to the those sites once the Legacy Modules no longer exist? Are these modules automatically updated to the new Divi 5 WC Modules? Will there be a working filter system for the shop page/category pages? That’s my current biggest gripe for building e-commerce on divi and the fact that other plugins don’t play well with template builder pages when filtering. So I have to use a non-divi theme when making a e-commerce store with many products that requires a good filtering system. Δ We offer a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee, so joining is Risk-Free!

Title: Bank of America shares an eye-popping chart showing a potential stock-market bubble: 'It better be different this time'

Stock-market bulls convinced of the power of AI to transform the economy often shrug off comparisons to the dot-com bubble a quarter century ago. The real profits are already showing up, unlike in the early days of the internet boom — so it is different this time, the thinking goes. But Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has a message for these investors: "It better be different this time." Hartnett, who has often expressed skepticism of the market's bull run over the last few years, shared a head-turning chart that highlights just how optimistic investors have become about the impact AI will have. It shows the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio, which measures the total market cap of the index's constituents compared to their total assets minus liabilities. The valuation measure is at a record high of 5.3, topping the 5.1 level seen in March 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Other classic valuation measures show market froth relative to history. For instance, Hartnett also shared a chart showing the S&P 500's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio. Except for August 2020, it's at the highest level since the dot-com era. And the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which measures current prices against a 10-year rolling average of earnings, is at similar levels to 1929, 2000, and 2021. High valuations reflect high expectations for future earnings. Sometimes those expectations turn out to be too elevated, and prices correct, but they don't necessitate a bubble scenario. So far, many AI firms have continually beat earnings expectations, suggesting the optimism could be justified. Valuations are also better predictors of average long-term returns than near-term performance, and views on Wall Street on where the market goes in the months ahead differ. Though there are calls for caution, many strategists continue to raise their year-end S&P 500 price targets. Earlier this week, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said the market is in the "best investing environment ever" thanks to factors like strong demand for stocks, looming rate cuts, and recent boosts in productivity and earnings growth. If the market does start to unwind, however, Hartnett said he sees bonds and non-US stocks benefiting. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these trades include the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU). Jump to

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun PANAMA CITY, Aug 14 (Reuters) – The Panama Canal will soon begin consultations with companies about launching a competitive tender in the first quarter of next year offering two new ports for construction and operation within its zone, a source involved in the preparations said on Thursday. The ports are part of a broad expansion plan being organized by the waterway’s administration. It aims to increase services related to cargo handling, including trans shipment, storage and gas transportation, and to secure fresh water for operations. “There is a large demand for facilities and terminals,” said Ricaurte Vasquez, head of the waterway, at a conference on Thursday, without elaborating on details. The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Its top executives have previously said the waterway plans to invest some $8.5 billion in the next five years to update and expand its infrastructure. A key project included in the planning, the construction of a large dam to contain the Indio river and create a new water reservoir, will be discussed at Panama’s Supreme Court after affected communities filed a lawsuit against it last month. Another tender to offer a project to build a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline within the canal zone also is in preparation and could be launched next year, the source added. U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the Panama Canal amid criticism of what his government has called the increasing influence of China over the Central American country. Meanwhile, Panama’s President Jose Mulino has moved to end a 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison 0001.HK for the operation of two key separate ports outside of the canal zone amid criticism of the contract’s terms. CK Hutchison said on Thursday that a $22.8 billion deal with a group led by BlackRock BLK.N and shipping firm MSC to sell most of its global port business, including the two ports in Panama, had a “reasonable chance” of going through.

Citron Research founder Andrew Left analyzes the state of the U.S. market and the wider economy on 'The Claman Countdown.' Warren Buffett is helping revive shares of beleaguered UnitedHealthcare Group after taking a $1.6 billion stake in the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. UnitedHealth shares clocked the largest one-day percent increase since March 2020, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group. It was on pace for the best day in 17 years before giving back some of those gains. For the week, shares rose over 21%, the best week since May 2009. Still, the stock is down more than 50% over the past 12 months. Investors, taking a cue from Buffett’s interest in healthcare, also piled into Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares and The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund. UnitedHealthcare Group DOJ PROBES UNITEDHEATLHCARE GROUP Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., plays bridge at an event on the sidelines of the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., on Sunday, May 6, 2019. (Photographer: Houston Cofield/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is known for taking positions in businesses it believes will perform over the long term and that have become, in some cases, undervalued. The healthcare giant has been plagued by a Department of Justice probe and the fallout from the fatal shooting of executive Brian Thompson outside the Midtown Hilton Hotel in New York City last year. The brazen killing turned a critical spotlight onto the nation’s healthcare insurance system. Luigi Mangione has been charged with murdering Thompson. FAMILY OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO SUSPECTED KILLER HAS BIG BUSINESS EMPIRE This 2017 file photo of Brian Thompson was released via Businesswire when he was named Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Unit in 2017. (Businesswire / Fox News) The stock helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average cinch a new record, heading for its first record close of 2025, and gave the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) a lift in tandem.

Title: Bullish crypto exchange surges 90% on debut, raising $1.1 billion

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange operator, saw its stock price surge on its opening day, ending at $70 with a 90% gain. This gave the company a market cap above $10 billion. The stock opened for trade near 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday at $90 and peaked at $118 per share shortly after, a 215% gain. However, the stock was halted for trade at least twice within the first few minutes due to volatility. Bullish, which operates a crypto exchange and owns the trade publication CoinDesk, launched its IPO on Tuesday. The company aimed higher than its anticipated price range of $32 to $33 per share. In 2021, Bullish sought a valuation of $9 billion but faced regulatory hurdles, causing them to withdraw their registration at the time. The debut of Bullish follows recent successful high-profile public offerings, including Figma and Circle. This indicates that the IPO market is robust after several challenging years. Data from IPO tracker and ETF operator Renaissance Capital shows that the market has introduced entities worth more than $50 million this year, up by more than 58% compared to last year. Major institutional investors showed substantial interest in Bullish ahead of its IPO. Firms such as BlackRock and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest signaled their interest in the offering, according to securities filings. Bullish CEO Thomas Farley, formerly COO and president of the NYSE Group, said, “We now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth. I believe that the digital assets industry is at the inflection point of institutional adoption and Bullish is uniquely positioned at the center of this market.” Bullish’s primary business operations come from its Bullish Exchange, a digital assets spot and derivative exchange targeting institutional-sized clients. The company’s prospectus shows that the exchange experienced robust activity throughout the first quarter of this year. The positive performance of digital assets this year also underscores Bullish’s strong IPO. Major cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial gains, with Bitcoin up more than 30%, Ethereum up more than 40%, and Ripple’s XRP up over 57% since the beginning of the year. The successful public offering of Bullish suggests that Wall Street’s predictions for a sluggish IPO market in 2025 may have been overly pessimistic.

The Dallas Cowboys topped the NFL's most valuable teams list, according to Sportico: Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million, over $370 million in today's dollars. Based on the new valuation, his investment has grown 9,042% from the initial $90 million cash outlay and $50 million loan. Several companies with the largest market capitalizations on the market today hadn't even been started in 1989—Microsoft and Apple were the only members of the eventual Magnificent Seven that existed at the time. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Google, now under parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), had not yet been founded. Here's a look at how the Cowboys' 9,000% gain compares to the return some of the most important stocks today, like Microsoft and Apple, have delivered since February 1989, along with how some of the companies with the largest market caps at the time have performed since. When applicable, stock prices have been adjusted to account for stock splits that have taken place in the decades since. Jerry Jones turned a $140 million bet on the Dallas Cowboys in 1989 into a $12.8 billion empire—one of the most lucrative investments in sports history. His 9,000% return rivals the long-term gains of giants like Walmart and Berkshire Hathaway, but is still dwarfed by the explosive gains of tech titans such as Microsoft and Apple.

US stock markets opened Friday on a turbulent note as investors weighed strong corporate moves against persistent inflation pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record intraday high of 45,203.52, fueled by gains in healthcare stocks. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped to 21,710.67, dragged down by profit-taking in tech and cautious semiconductor forecasts. The spotlight was on UnitedHealth (UNH), which jumped over 11% after Warren Buffett’s $1.57 billion stake was disclosed, signaling renewed investor confidence. Traders also digested July’s 0.9% jump in the Producer Price Index (PPI), keeping Treasury yields elevated and adding pressure on growth-oriented stocks.

Title: Target Reports Earnings Next Week. Investors Are Wary—or Worse—About Its Stock.

Can Target turn it around? That's the big question ahead of Wednesday morning, when the big retailer is set to report its latest financial results. Those numbers, along with whatever the company says about its outlook and the state of its business, could go a long way toward restoring investor confidence in a stock that's lost nearly one-quarter of its value this year while Walmart (WMT) has posted a double-digit advance. There's a simple enough reason investors have been cautious around Target's (TGT) stock, which fell in the wake of its first-quarter earnings report and has since crept gently higher. Executives in May clipped the company's outlook for 2025, setting investors up to expect declining sales and lower earnings per share than previously forecast. Wall Street is looking for revenue and adjusted net income to fall year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Visible Alpha data, with same-store sales also seen declining. One measure of the wariness out there: As of today, there's a sell-side analyst with a full-on bearish take on the stock. Bank of America on Friday downgraded the shares to "underperform"—the only such rating tracked by Visible Alpha—and a $93 price target more than 10 bucks below Thursday's close. The wider picture shows a number of analysts with neutral ratings on the stock, though a few still hold bullish ratings. Oppenheimer analysts on Friday suggested buying dips, as "volatile trading could continue until comps return to positive territory." Visible Alpha's consensus target around $104 in line with the stock's finish yesterday. Bank of America analysts said they're less concerned with next week's results than the broader story, citing worries about digital sales, the state of Target's digital advertising and third-party marketplace, and tariff concerns. They also pointed to competitive pressure from Walmart, which reports its own results on Thursday, and Amazon (AMZN), which this week pushed further into the grocery business. "Target's longer-term outlook," they wrote, "is becoming more uncertain."

Title: Cisco Study Explores The Truth About RTO Mandates And Hybrid Work
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2025/08/15/cisco-study-explores-the-truth-about-rto-mandates-and-hybrid-work/
Time Published: 2025-08-15T15:05:21Z

ByMelody Brue ByMelody Brue, Contributor. As businesses navigate the post-pandemic landscape, the debate around hybrid and remote work has only intensified. Cisco’s Global Hybrid Work Study 2025 reveals key trends and tensions around workplace flexibility, productivity and enterprise culture — a landscape where technology, human behavior and leadership intersect. Cisco’s study presents a clear shift: after waves of return-to-office mandates, the proportion of hybrid workers has dropped from 62% in 2022 to 45% today, and 72% of organizations now require some office attendance. Nearly half of those companies have increased in-office requirements compared to prior policies. This trend correlates with self-reported productivity gains (73% of employees report higher productivity) and measurable improvements in retention rates and employee well-being. Yet beneath the positive metrics lies a persistent tension: 63% of employees would accept a pay cut for more remote flexibility, and this sentiment is stronger among high performers. Results from the HP Work Relationship Index align with this point, showing that 83% of global knowledge workers would trade part of their salary for better flexibility and autonomy. The responses of top talent in Cisco’s survey also offer important insights about attrition. 78% of high-performing employees would consider leaving a company if work policies were not flexible enough. The Cisco data suggests a significant disconnect between leaders and employees on the value of mandated office attendance. From the employee perspective, 77% believe that a lack of trust drives rigid RTO mandates, and only 39% of employees agree that those mandated office days boost productivity. This sentiment contrasts with employers’ perceptions. 88% of employers believe there is a strong direct relationship between workplace productivity and frequent, consistent attendance in the office. There is another disconnect around well-being, with only 28% of employees seeing these mandates as beneficial to their well-being, compared to 42% of employers. However, this does not mean employees never want to be in the office, as 92% believe community and collaboration are key aspects of office culture. Financial considerations also influence both employers’ and employees’ perspectives on the office, but in different ways. 57% of employers in the Cisco study cited real-estate and building-maintenance expenses as the primary influencer of their organization’s preferred work model, while 40% of employees complained about commuting costs. Being in the office does more than boost metrics; it also nurtures connection, knowledge sharing and spontaneous learning. The Cisco study shows that 76% of respondents (and 85% of high performers) say office presence has accelerated their career progress. Additionally, 86% of employees and 81% of employers see regular attendance as critical for advancement, mentoring and inclusion. To offer a personal example, early in my career at a Hollywood studio, physical presence in a collaborative office was a valuable part of my learning — and gave me opportunities to seize unspoken opportunities. These experiences, which would have been difficult to find had I worked from home, occurred when “collaboration tools” meant a fax machine, a phone or email. While today’s immersive solutions can address some gaps, capturing the full career benefits of proximity now requires intentional, well-designed hybrid workflows, not haphazard adoption of new devices. As companies seek the right balance of RTO and hybrid and remote work, employers and employees must also remain vigilant about proximity bias. Proximity bias favors those who are physically present, often resulting in them receiving more opportunities, recognition and even protection from layoffs. One study from Beautiful.ai found that 60% of U.S. managers believed remote workers would be the first to be let go in a downturn. Left unchecked, proximity bias can create inequity, restrict knowledge transfer and marginalize remote contributors even when metrics suggest their performance is equal or greater. I wrote about the potential for this bias amidst Amazon’s RTO mandates in 2023, and it remains relevant. This is a cultural challenge, not just a management one. Workers, especially those early in their careers or aiming for advancement, must be mindful of how an intentional, strategic office presence can create opportunities, learning and recognition that are harder to cultivate from a distance. Perhaps more importantly, leaders must prioritize data-driven objective performance assessment over face time. As Francine Katsoudas, Cisco’s chief people, policy and purpose officer, said, “When we make the office about mentorship, connection [and] career development, people understand the value of being there. But when we focus solely on the work, it’s a less compelling value proposition.” Generational differences are a significant factor in shaping preferences about, and satisfaction with, hybrid work policies. According to Cisco’s study, employees from different generations report varying satisfaction levels with workplace arrangements, but flexibility is a consistent preference, especially among younger employees. Gen Z employees strongly prefer flexible work, expressing the greatest desire for autonomy over when and where they work. The report highlights that Gen Z employees rely heavily on collaboration technology and are most likely to expect workplace flexibility as a standard. Satisfaction with “fully flexible” arrangements is higher among younger generations, with Gen Z and Gen Y (millennials) reporting greater contentment under such policies compared to Gen X, who are the least likely to be “very satisfied” with flexibility, even though it remains their preferred model. Motivations to be in the office vary by generation as well. While most employees across generations recognize the importance of in-person work for career advancement and mentoring opportunities, younger employees are less satisfied with mandated full-time office attendance. For example, only 22% of Gen Z employees are satisfied with being required to work in the office full-time, whereas 38% of boomer employees report high satisfaction with this arrangement. Technology and well-being are again notable factors. Across the full employee base, nine out of ten (92%) employees rate collaboration and a sense of community as top reasons to value the office. Still, younger workers are more likely to expect advanced digital tools and wellness support as a part of their workplace experience. According to Cisco’s data, 90% of employees value collaboration tools, but only 32% of employers invest in high-grade technology that supports flexible, hybrid work models. This glaring gap between what employees want and what employers provide is where appropriate technology can make a real difference. Realizing this opportunity, tech companies are bringing out new products to close the gap between in-person and remote work. At the high end of the market, we see deluxe immersive tools like HP’s Dimension with Google Beam, which uses cutting-edge light field technology, spatial audio and multi-camera setups to create natural, lifelike remote meetings. At a somewhat more accessible price point, the Cisco Desk Pro — which I use in my home office and love — brings advanced video, smart framing and all-in-one collaboration tools to the hybrid desk, making virtual interactions smoother. The two examples just mentioned are high-end solutions, and widespread adoption of products like these will be constrained by expense and IT infrastructure demands. However, a range of more accessible tools can help to connect remote and hybrid workers at lower price points. For example, I use the iContact Camera Pro ($189) and the Elgato Prompter ($299). These tools are designed to facilitate direct eye contact, allowing me to look at my screen or read a script while still making eye contact with my audience on any platform — including Teams, Zoom or Webex. By positioning the camera or script in my line of sight, I can maintain this crucial connection while also picking up on people’s reactions and non-verbal cues. This is critical, as a recent study shows that eye contact in virtual communication is as important as in-person eye contact for conveying confidence, building rapport and fostering trust among colleagues and clients. Many device companies serving this market have also made significant strides in meeting-room technology, which can help remote participants feel more seen and heard regardless of which device they are using. Advanced systems now include AI-directed video framing that automatically zooms in on the current speaker or keeps the whole room in frame without manual adjustments. For example, Cisco Webex devices feature “cinematic meetings” experiences so that remote attendees get a clearer view of the conversation — which, in my view, helps with feeling included. Many collaboration platforms also prioritize high-quality audio with AI audio codecs that can reduce background noise and improve voice clarity even in challenging network conditions. Yet regardless of the device or price point, a gap remains in the investment that most companies are making in technology to support remote work for their rank-and-file employees. Finding the right blend of flexibility, inclusion and high performance remains a primary dilemma in the modern workplace. The best organizations won’t treat hybrid work as a binary choice. Instead, they will design purposeful systems that blend physical and digital environments, maximizing human connection and personal autonomy. In a briefing at this year’s Cisco Live event, Katsoudas emphasized, “It is more of a conversation that we need to have with our people around how they work and how they’re at their best.” However, implementing such a conversation in a big organization (Cisco, for instance, has 90,000 employees) is a significant challenge. Leaders must leverage technology and data to create a culture of feedback and trust that can scale beyond one-on-one discussions. Companies should also be careful not to mandate office attendance simply for the sake of following a single standard, as this risks losing access to a broader talent pool and could compromise diversity. Leaders must design in-office experiences that deliver unique value, such as in-person collaboration, mentorship and fostering a stronger connection to company culture — just not every day. At Cisco Live, Christian Bigsby, senior vice president of workplace resources at Cisco, emphasized the importance of designing flexible office spaces, using the phrase “more wheels, less walls” to describe the approach. He explained that instead of creating fixed, rigid environments, companies should design offices so spaces and furniture can be easily moved and reconfigured as needs change. By doing so, they can also counter the need for larger office spaces and leverage smart-workplace tech to optimize the space they do use. Hybrid work’s success will depend on connecting technology’s promise with thoughtful leadership and personal agency. This ensures the benefits of advancement, learning and engagement are accessible for all, wherever they work.

Title: Eli Lilly hikes Mounjaro prices in the UK to make weight-loss drug cheaper in the US | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Eli Lilly will significantly increase the price of its weight-loss drug Mounjaro in the United Kingdom in a bid to bring down prices in the United States after weeks of pressure from the Trump administration. The US drugmaker announced Thursday that it was rolling out price hikes across Europe, with prices rising in the UK from September. The price of a month’s supply of the highest dose of Mounjaro in the UK will rise from £122 ($165) to £330 ($447), Eli Lilly confirmed to CNN, representing a 170% increase. Eli Lilly (LLY) confirmed that prices for Mounjaro accessed through the NHS, the UK’s public health service, would remain unchanged. Around 220,000 Brits are expected to access Mounjaro, which is also used by diabetics, through the NHS in the first three years of its introduction. Private suppliers will be able to negotiate with Eli Lilly in an attempt to gain discounts. Following Eli Lilly’s announcement, Juniper, a private weight-loss clinic in the UK, published a blog offering Mounjaro patients a pathway to switch to Wegovy, a competing weight-loss jab manufactured by Danish group Novo Nordisk (NVO). In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company had originally agreed a UK list price that was significantly below the European average to prevent delays in NHS availability when Mounjaro was first launched in the country. “With changes in the environment and new clinical evidence supporting the value of Mounjaro, we are now aligning the list price more consistently to ensure fair global contributions to the cost of innovation,” the spokesperson said. US pharmaceutical companies have faced intense pressure from President Donald Trump over the disparity in drug prices between the United States and Europe. Trump has accused foreign nations of “freeloading” at the expense of American innovation. Eli Lilly said in its statement that it was committed to keeping the United States as the global leader in drug research and manufacturing. The drugmaker said it had in recent months “intensified efforts to align prices across developed countries, especially in Europe.” “This rebalancing may be difficult, but it means the prices for medicines paid by governments and health systems need to increase in other developed markets like Europe in order to make them lower in the US,” the company said in the statement. In July, Trump sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, ordering them to lower the price of prescription drugs in the United States. At the time, Chris Meekins, managing director of health policy research at Raymond James, told CNN that, while pressure from Trump may result in price increases or delayed access to drugs in other countries, it was unlikely to directly help the American consumer. Trump signed an executive order in May that aimed to force US pharmaceutical companies to bring European and US drug prices into harmony under a “Most Favored Nation” rule. While several experts have previously told CNN that Trump has limited legal power to force drugmakers to lower domestic prices, his efforts indicate a strong political will that could lead to drugmakers changing their pricing voluntarily. The president has been particularly critical of the price disparity in weight-loss drugs across the Atlantic Ocean. Speaking in May upon signing his executive order, Trump referenced a conversation with a friend who complained about the difference in the pricing of what Trump called the “fat shot drug” between the UK and the US. “He said, ‘I just paid $88, and in New York I paid $1,300. What the hell is going on?’ So, I checked, and it’s the same box made in the same plant by the same company,” Trump said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

BlackRock’s cryptocurrency portfolio has surpassed the $100 billion mark, as Bitcoin and Ethereum push to new all-time highs. The world’s largest asset manager now holds nearly $104 billion in digital assets, and this achievement came as Bitcoin briefly broke above $124,000 on August 14, 2025, to set a new price record before consolidating between $118,000 and $121,000. Ethereum also surged to nearly $4,790, just shy of its 2021 peak of $4,878. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been on a price roll in recent weeks, and a large part of this momentum can be attributed to steady institutional inflows into Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs based in the US. At the forefront of this surge is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which continues to dominate in terms of assets under management (AUM) and growth in cryptocurrency exposure, particularly in Ethereum in the past two months. Interestingly, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that BlackRock has crossed the $100 billion mark in terms of total crypto holdings. This interesting milestone is based on a combination of inflows into its ETFs, which has increased its accumulation strategy, and the recent uptick in the price of cryptocurrencies across the board. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows BlackRock’s total holdings recently hit a peak value of $107 billion when Bitcoin reached a record price of $124,128 yesterday, and Ethereum reached a multi-year price peak of $4,775. At the time of writing, the investment management company is holding 744,240 BTC worth $88.43 billion and 3.2 million ETH, worth approximately $14.78 billion. At the beginning of 2025, BlackRock’s cryptocurrency portfolio was valued at roughly $54 billion, with the overwhelming majority of that exposure concentrated in Bitcoin. However, the first quarter of the year brought a period of weakness, as Arkham Intelligence data shows the portfolio’s value slid to a low of about $46 billion in early April. From that point on, momentum shifted sharply in the opposite direction. The firm’s total holdings have since climbed by about 124% from April 7 up until the time of writing. Bitcoin still accounts for more than 85% of BlackRock’s crypto allocation, but the most remarkable growth story in the past eight months has come from Ethereum. In both volume and market value, ETH holdings have expanded at a far more aggressive pace than Bitcoin, surging by over 309% in dollar terms since the start of the year. At the start of 2025, BlackRock’s Bitcoin reserves stood at approximately 552,000 BTC. Current data indicates that Bitcoin holdings have grown by about 34% over the course of the year. Ethereum’s expansion within BlackRock’s portfolio has been even more notable, as the firm began the year with roughly 1.1 million ETH and has more than doubled its position in just eight months, with the current volume representing a 190% increase.

Title: Berkshire Hathaway’s Second Quarter 2025 Portfolio Moves

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. "The trick in investing is just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot, and if people are yelling, 'Swing, you bum!' ignore them." – Warren Buffett in the HBO Documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett” (2017) Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) second-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on August 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the US publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s second-quarter earnings report, which contains information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, was released on Saturday, August 2. Berkshire’s $257.5 billion investment portfolio consists of 41 companies, five more than reported for last quarter. Berkshire was a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top 5 holdings account for 70% of the total portfolio. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with 87% of assets in the top ten holdings. Before the 2024 sales, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 22%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling since 2024 has taken technology to an underweight. While Berkshire Hathaway had no change in its Apple (AAPL) position for the first quarter, it was trimmed again in the second quarter. Despite continued trimming of Bank of America (BAC) in the second quarter, the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at 39% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28.1% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has two small holdings in the industrial sector: Heico-A (HEI/A), which was added to in the quarter, and Allegion PLC (ALLE), which was a new addition to the portfolio. Allegion provides security products, systems, and services and is based in Ireland. Within any recollection, the portfolio has had no real estate companies, but that changed in the second quarter with the purchase of Lamar Advertising-A (LAMR). Lamar is not a typical real estate company, as it owns and operates outdoor advertising. Berkshire continues to own no publicly traded utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines via Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. According to regulatory filings in March 2025, Berkshire now has 8.5% to 9.8% ownership in these trading companies. In Buffett’s 2024 annual letter, he noted that all five companies had agreed to relax the previously agreed-upon 10% ownership ceiling. At the recent annual meeting, Buffett said he “won’t give a thought” to selling them and expects Berkshire to own them for fifty years or more. In the first quarter, Berkshire requested and received confidential treatment for “one or more holding(s)” from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Typically, this means Buffett or another investment professional is attempting to continue to add to the holding, and disclosure would likely drive the price higher. It was revealed along with the second-quarter filing that the three secret holdings were Nucor (NUE), Lennar-A (LEN), and D.R. Horton (DHI). Nucor is a steel maker. Lennar and D.R. Horton are builders of single-family homes. While single-family home sales are well off their recent peak and even 2005 levels, these homebuilders have remained profitable. There is a case that the US needs more housing stock, and our current homes are aging, which could provide a long-term opportunity, despite the short-term industry challenges of affordability and high mortgage interest rates. The UnitedHealth Group (UNH), provider of healthcare insurance, was also added to the portfolio in the second quarter. Berkshire added to its positions in Constellation Brands (STZ), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Chevron (OXY), Lennar-B (LEN/B), and Heico-A (HEI/A). Berkshire added to its previously held position in the Lennar B-shares. Berkshire eliminated its T-Mobile (TMUS) positions. As noted previously, Berkshire reduced its positions in Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media—Formula One (FWONK), and Davita (DVA) were also trimmed. Notably, the Davita sales were related to a 2024 agreement in which Davita will buy back shares quarterly from Berkshire when its stake rises above 45%. This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior returns on capital as measured by return on equity with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Notably, Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the superior return on equity combined with an exceptional free cash flow yield. Berkshire was a net seller of $3 billion in publicly traded stocks in the second quarter, the eleventh straight quarter of Berkshire Hathaway’s net sales of stocks. Berkshire bought $3.9 billion of stocks while selling $6.9 billion. Driven by earnings and continued stock sales, Berkshire has amassed a massive cash pile on an absolute basis and relative to the company’s size. Buffett and his associates have been unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay. At the annual meeting, Buffett said that Berkshire “holds a lot more cash and Treasury bills than I would like.” He always looks for investments, but “things don’t come along in an orderly fashion.” Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio remained elevated during the second quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. The stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2024 were likely done at around 1.4-1.5 times book value. Berkshire’s stock reached almost 1.8 times book in May 2025, so a lack of repurchases in the quarter wasn’t unexpected. Despite the lack of enough compelling publicly traded stock opportunities, following the decline in its own shares, Berkshire’s valuation is nearing a level where repurchases might restart. Share repurchases of Berkshire stock had been off the table at the elevated valuations, but an additional lever for Buffett to create value might soon return. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies. I am a long-time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.

Title: 24/7 Market News: "Our Pipeline Is Roaring" VENU Breaks Out and Expanding National Footprint

August 15, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, reports that momentum is rapidly building around Venu Holding Corporation (NYSE American: VENU)(“VENU”), a developer and operator of premium live music amphitheaters and hospitality destinations, announced its Q2 2025 financial results, after yesterday’s market close, during an earnings call that highlighted a surge in asset growth, record fan engagement, and expanded national momentum. “As we close out his quarter, we’re seeing the pieces come together, for what’s going to be a defining moment in our growth history. While our attention, this quarter, has heavily been on our balance sheet, it’s all with the P&L in mind,” exclaimed J.W. Roth, VENU’s Founder, Chairman & CEO. Roth later stated, “Here’s the deal, our growth is guided by four clear priorities. First, expanding our markets across the nation. Second, bringing current developments over the finish line and packing their calendars with great content. Third, growing our FireSuite sales with a focus on high impact triple net transactions that go straight on to our balance sheet. And finally, unlocking strategic value, through high value opportunities, like naming rights and sale lease backs.” Financial and Strategic Highlights: The Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs hosted 35,000+ fans across its first 10 shows this season, generating $4.7 million in gross receipts with an average ticket price of $135. Net revenue from amphitheater operations and naming rights totaled $597,712 for the quarter. Development Pipeline and Capital Strategy: “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area. To accelerate these agreements, we have a strong partnership with industry leader, Ryan, LLC. This three-year partnership is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter and, on average, we can expect to add between $150 to $300 million to our balance sheet, with each delivered development agreement.” Additionally, VENU’s triple-net lease partnership with Sands Investment Group, announced in May, has exceeded expectations, with demand far surpassing initial forecasts. Based on early momentum, the program is projected to generate over $100 million in additional annual capital, creating a powerful new revenue stream alongside traditional FireSuite sales. “From the day we began our journey, we have been clear on how we intend to fund all of our expansion; partially through public private partnerships, partially through the sale of our FireSuites, and then toward the end of every project, the sale leaseback of the ground underneath the development. The current opportunity is intended to complete the financing of our entire project and will likely result in a development profit,” said Roth. “We have been presented with a significant opportunity to activate sale leaseback sale opportunities. Once completed and accepted, the current one is expected to generate $188 million and a development profit of roughly $35 million in the fourth quarter of this year, with another $35 million expected in the fourth quarter of 2026.” Institutional Confidence Is Rising: Vanguard Makes Its Move With a current market capitalization exceeding $600 million, VENU is officially no longer a micro-cap, marking a transformative milestone that opens the door to increased institutional ownership, broader analyst coverage, and potential inclusion in small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600. One of the clearest signs of VENU’s growing credibility on Wall Street is that Vanguard Group, one of the world’s largest asset managers, disclosed a new position in VENU. According to its Q2 2025 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Vanguard now holds 861,911 shares, representing approximately 2.3% of VENU’s outstanding stock, with a market value of about $13 million. Vanguard becomes one of the first two major institutions to establish a position in VENU, paving the way for what is likely to be many more, as this development significantly broadens the potential investor base to include many mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance company portfolios. “If Q2 proved anything, it’s that the foundation is set and we are roaring ahead. The fans are getting what they always deserved, our model is working, municipalities are hungry, momentum is real and the market is ours to take. In closing, everything that we’ve been working on is pointing to a development profit in the fourth quarter of this year and operationally profit in the third quarter/fourth quarter of 2026,” Roth added. Strategic Partnerships Driving Scale: Roth concluded, “The future that we’ve been building toward is right in front of us and it’s coming fast. We are on pace to add more than $5 billion in completed project value in the next 36 to 48 months and, if Q2 is any sign, we’ve laid the foundation for things to come.” A replay of the call is available through August 14, 2026, at: https://investors.venu.live.

August 15, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: SharpLink Gaming, Inc. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. MINNEAPOLIS, MN, Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) (“SharpLink” or the “Company”), one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Ether (“ETH”) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, along with an update on the rapid expansion of the Company’s ETH treasury strategy. In early June 2025, SharpLink executed a significant strategic shift – establishing ETH as the Company’s primary treasury reserve asset. SharpLink’s goal is simple: give investors the most efficient way to participate in Ethereum’s transformation of global finance, with institutional-grade discipline, transparency and full activation of ETH’s yield potential. SharpLink is strategically accumulating ETH through disciplined capital formation and employing active treasury management. The result is a powerful, yield-generating ETH treasury that compounds growth and captures the full upside exposure of ETH while improving our ETH Concentration metric. Every step of this strategy strengthens the Ethereum network and creates enduring long-term value, aligning stockholder growth with the growth of the ecosystem itself. SharpLink’s treasury strategy is based on a single conviction: ETH will serve as the core trust commodity of the next-generation financial system being built on Ethereum. Key Highlights Since Launch of ETH Treasury Strategy Chalom stated, “Our second quarter marked the exciting launch of SharpLink’s ETH treasury strategy, which has positioned us at the center of a transformational opportunity in global finance and technology. In the short period since launching our strategy, we’ve raised significant capital and scaled our ETH holdings in a highly accretive manner. Backed by the unmatched expertise of Consensys and our institutional-grade capital markets and treasury management teams, SharpLink has become one of the world’s largest and most trusted corporate holders of ETH.” “Ethereum is the trust layer for the decentralized economy, and SharpLink’s aggressive accumulation, staking and strategic management of ETH set it apart from any other public company in the market,” added Lubin. “SharpLink is actively compounding value for our fellow stockholders through yield generation and intelligent capital deployment.” Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2025 Financial Highlights for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 For more detailed information on SharpLink’s second quarter financial and operational results, please refer to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, August 14, 2025, which can be found at www.sec.gov or www.sharplink.com. Q2 2025 Conference Call and Webcast As a reminder, SharpLink’s leadership will host a conference call and webcast beginning at 8:30 AM ET today to discuss the Company’s financial and operating results for the three- and six-month reporting periods ended June 30, 2025. The Company will also provide an update on recent developments, including the launch of its Ethereum treasury strategy on June 2, 2025 and subsequent strategic actions aimed at accelerating long-term stockholder value. To access the call or webcast, please use one of the following means: * To enhance transparency into the Company’s yield performance, SharpLink introduced a new reporting metric called “ETH Concentration.” This metric is calculated by dividing the number of ETH SharpLink holds by each 1,000 assumed diluted shares issued and outstanding (“Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding”). Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding represents the sum of (i) SharpLink’s actual shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the end of each reporting period, inclusive of disclosed ATM sales and Registered Direct offerings, plus (ii) the additional shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise or settlement of all outstanding warrants, pre-funded warrants, stock option awards, and restricted stock units. Notably, Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding is not calculated using the treasury stock method. It does not account for equity award vesting conditions, stock option exercise prices, or contractual restrictions limiting the convertibility of debt instruments. Additionally, it excludes any assumed share repurchases that would ordinarily be considered under the treasury stock method. About SharpLink Gaming, Inc.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been.

And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Why Paramount’s $7.7 Billion UFC Gamble Will Pay Off
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2025/08/15/why-paramounts-77-billion-ufc-gamble-will-pay-off/
Time Published: 2025-08-15T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByMatt Craig ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. In his first week as the new owner and CEO of Paramount Skydance, David Ellison has wasted no time differentiating himself from the previous ownership group. With a $1.5 billion dollar deal for South Park and a blockbuster $7.7 deal to land UFC for the next seven years, he has already committed billions in just his first week on the job, and may not be done writing big checks. But considering the company has struggled with profitability in recent years, recording an operating loss of $5.27 billion in 2024, it’s reasonable to wonder how Paramount plans to recoup the value for the $1.1 billion per year it will pay on average to the UFC, and whether in an effort to outbid competitors like Amazon and Netflix it paid too high a price. “On a standalone basis we struggle to see how Paramount earns back their investment,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note this week. “However, this deal does cement Paramount’s willingness to once again invest serious capital into the business in an effort to scale long-term.” Under the previous ownership of National Amusements, led by Shari Redstone, Paramount looked in recent years to shore up its balance sheet by selling or licensing some of its most valuable assets. In 2021, it sold the skyscraper that served as CBS’ New York headquarters for $760 million and later that year unloaded the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles for $1.85 billion. Two years later, Paramount sold the publishing company Simon & Schuster for $1.62 billion, and explored further sales for cable channel BET and streaming service Showtime that never materialized. Two of the company’s flagship shows, Yellowstone and South Park, were licensed to other streaming services for a cash influx. The 42-year-old Ellison—son of the world’s second richest person, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison—has already made it clear his intention to reverse that trend. On Wednesday, he told reporters that Paramount was no longer shopping BET and plans to keep the company’s assets intact for now. As he told the Wall Street Journal this week: “You can’t cut to grow.” Still, the money has to come from somewhere—other than the $290 billion net worth of his father. The younger Ellison has promised $2 billion in cuts, and significant layoffs are expected to occur before the end of the year. In the short-term it will be a tight squeeze, with the company’s streaming efforts being bankrolled by its linear broadcast channels. “Certainly for the first half of this [UFC] deal, CBS is paying for it,” says Patrick Crakes, a media analyst and former Fox Sports executive who worked closely with UFC during its time on the network. “Will it make a lot of money back? I don't know, but I don’t think that was the point. Paramount has increased its value with this deal by being viable. And this makes it more viable and important and must-see. So I would look for them to invest more in this area, not less.” Crakes knows firsthand what effects a deal like this can have on a network. In 1993 he had just been promoted out of the mail room at Fox, and was asked to load slides into the carousel for a presentation the network was making to the NFL, whose television rights were up for renegotiation. Fox eventually won the NFC package away from incumbent CBS by paying $400 million per year, seen at the time as vastly overpaying for football, considering CBS’ previous $265 million deal. During Crakes’ 23 years at Fox, he says he can only recall the NFL turning a direct accounting profit once. But because of the value and legitimacy the league brought to Rupert Murdoch’s then-nascent network, it was able to negotiate for better signal strength, channel position, and eventually build up a local station affiliate network that became enormously profitable for the company. While the UFC is clearly not on the level of the NFL, it does have a rabid fanbase that has proven it will follow the sport to new platforms. In his MoffettNathanson report, Fishman estimates that UFC could attract six million new subscribers to Paramount+, comparable to its first two years on ESPN+, with the potential for more because of the elimination of the pay-per-view model on its biggest events. Those numbers are a drop in the Octagon spit bucket compared to Paramount’s ultimate strategy, says Crakes. He, like nearly all media analysts, remains convinced that the current array of streaming services will eventually be bundled or consolidated into fewer digital offerings in the future. And that future is coming quickly. Just this week, ESPN and Fox announced a new streaming bundle, in the wake of the abandoned Venu Sports venture those two networks announced with Warner Bros. Discovery last year. By beefing up its content offerings, Paramount hopes to create a package that becomes not only indispensable for inclusion in future bundles, but also increases the share of revenue it can command. In other words, much like the cable bundles of 20 years ago, media companies are back to jockeying for carriage fees. Because live sports will drive most of that value, there’s almost no price too high to corner the market on an entire sport like MMA. Mark Shapiro, president and COO of UFC parent company TKO Holdings, says he has been hearing the rumblings that the sports rights bubble will burst since 2005 when he ran programming at ESPN, but has found eager bidders each time he has taken out rights packages. “The crash is just not there, it’s not true,” Shapiro tells Forbes. “You've got multiple platforms, varying strategies, linear and non-linear, they all need premium content and sports is the last bastion of unifying content.” With the addition of year-round UFC programming to Paramount’s strong seasonal sports offerings on CBS—including the NFL, The Masters and March Madness—plus entertainment brands like Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and the Star Trek universe, suddenly Paramount looks far more attractive as an acquisition or merger candidate. Or, given the backing of the Ellisons, Paramount could be the one doing the acquiring—especially given the makeup of Ellison’s new board of directors, which includes private equity veterans from RedBird Capital as well as Silver Lake’s Justin Hamill, who served for six years as the head of M&A at global law firm Latham & Watkins. “This is repositioning an old stodgy media brand into a tech-first, personalized content brand, one that could be an acquirer instead of a target,” says Chris Bevilacqua, a 30-year broadcast veteran and cofounder of Bevilacqua Helfant Ventures. “The question is, really, are they going to be one of those 4-5 services at the end of the movie?” That desire to compete against the biggest companies in the industry, and win, is one reason why UFC CEO Dana White was sold on getting Paramount in his corner. “They know exactly what they’re doing,” White told Forbes earlier this week. “The Ellisons are brilliant businessmen and they have a whole game plan behind this thing, so I love being in business with them for the next seven years."

Title: A laid-off Microsoft worker says his best career move was focusing on his side business instead of the corporate ladder

Eduardo Noriega spent over a decade preparing for the possibility that Microsoft would one day lay him off. When that day came, he was ready. In May, after 17 years with the company at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters, Noriega learned his role as a senior software engineer was being cut. He told Business Insider he's extremely grateful for his time at Microsoft. However, he started having concerns about job security amid the Great Recession when, less than a year into his role, the company announced plans to cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said the 51-year-old. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best shot at financial stability was building a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job at Microsoft. Rather than focusing solely on climbing the corporate ladder, he decided to continue working on a side business he'd started in Mexico. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made. "I decided not to put all my eggs in the career promotion basket, but to try to build something on my own," he said. "That's where I put a good deal of my eggs, and that's what paid off once I was laid off." Noriega is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who have been laid off in recent months. After cutting 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor-level engineers like Noriega. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Noriega to count on traditional employers for income. Instead, they may turn to working for themselves. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: When Noriega started at Microsoft, he saw three potential career paths. One was to dedicate himself to the job and hope that promotions and raises would follow. Another was to jump between companies every few years, gradually landing more senior and higher-paying roles. The third was to build a side business with the goal of someday turning it into a full-time job. Noriega said his lifelong passion for entrepreneurship — along with a desire for a backup plan in case of a layoff — pulled him toward the third path. When he wasn't working at Microsoft, he dedicated time to a software education business that he'd begun developing before he moved to the US. After a few years, when the business didn't take off as he'd hoped, he shifted his focus to an online piano lessons venture — but that one also struggled to get off the ground. In 2016, he launched NTSprint, a staffing firm that helps Latin American software engineers access remote jobs in the US and Canada. Noriega, who is originally from Cuba and lived in Mexico for several years, said his goal was to help engineers in the region land higher-paying jobs and "break the cycle of poverty" in their communities. Over the past decade, Noriega has poured significant time and energy into building the business. In the year leading up to his Microsoft layoff, he said his typical schedule involved finishing work at 5 p.m., then exercising, showering, and eating dinner before working on NTSprint from 8 p.m. to midnight. In addition to those four-hour weeknights, he said he'd often spend up to eight hours on the business each Saturday and Sunday. "I was working like crazy," he said. Noriega said working on his business outside work hours was in compliance with Microsoft's moonlighting policy, which he said allows employees to pursue side projects or businesses as long as it's done outside company hours, the business doesn't compete with Microsoft, and company resources aren't used. Noriega said he was transparent about his business with his manager and didn't face any pushback. When Microsoft laid him off in May, Noriega said he'd already been talking with his wife about whether he should quit his job and focus exclusively on his business. He said he was earning more money from the business than from his Microsoft role, and the long hours were taking a toll. However, he said he couldn't bring himself to resign — doing so would mean giving up a steady paycheck, excellent health insurance, and unvested stock. Noriega said getting laid off by Microsoft was likely very difficult for most employees, but for him, it provided the push he needed to focus on his business full-time. He hasn't looked for another job since. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." Noriega said he thinks people who have concerns about their job security should consider diversifying their incomes — whether through freelancing, consulting, or building a business. He knows this isn't feasible for everyone, but said doing so helped him blunt the financial and career impacts of his layoff. In his final days at Microsoft, Noriega said a coworker told him he "won the Microsoft game." "What she meant is that I worked hard for the company, but once I was laid off, I was not left empty-handed and in despair, rushing to get the next job to support my family," he said. Jump to

Title: Asian shares mostly gain after uptick in inflation pulls US stocks lower

U.S. stocks edged back from their record levels in a quiet finish to another winning week NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks edged back from their record levels on Friday in a quiet finish to another winning week. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% from the all-time high it set the day before, as it closed its fourth winning week in the last five. The Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with its own record, which was set in December, before ending just below the mark with a rise of 34 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4%, though it’s still near its record set on Wednesday. The U.S. stock market reached all-time highs this past week as expectations built that the Federal Reserve will deliver a cut to interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. A disappointing report about inflation at the U.S. wholesale level made traders pare back bets for coming cuts to interest rates on Thursday, but they’re still overwhelmingly expecting them. Such anticipation has sent Treasury yields lower in the bond market, though they inched higher Friday following some mixed updates on the economy. One said shoppers boosted their spending at U.S. retailers last month, as economists expected, while another said that manufacturing in New York state unexpectedly grew. A third said industrial production across the country shrank last month, when economists were looking for modest growth. Another report suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is worsening because of worries about inflation, when economists expected to see a slight improvement. “Overall, consumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April,” when President Donald Trump announced his stunning set of worldwide tariffs, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan’s surveys of consumers. “However, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.” On Wall Street, UnitedHealth Group jumped 12% after famed investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it bought nearly 5 million shares of the insurer during the spring, valued at $1.57 billion. Buffett is known for trying to buy good stocks at affordable prices, and UnitedHealth’s halved for the year by the end of July because of a run of struggles. Berkshire Hathaway’s own stock slipped 0.4%. Applied Materials helped lead Wall Street lower with a decline of 14.1% even though it reported better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The focus was on the company’s forecast for a drop in revenue during the current quarter. Its products help manufacture semiconductors and advanced displays, and CEO Gary Dickerson pointed to a “dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment, which is creating increased uncertainty and lower visibility in the near term, including for our China business.” Sandisk fell 4.6% despite reporting a profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. Investors focused instead on the data storage company’s forecast for profit in the current quarter, which came up short of Wall Street’s. All told, the S&P 500 fell 18.74 points to 6,449.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 34.86 to 44,946.12, and the Nasdaq composite sank 87.69 to 21,622.98. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose 0.8% in Shanghai but fell 1% in Hong Kong after data showed China’s economy may have slowed in July under pressure from uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs. “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support,” ING Economics said in a market commentary. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7% after the government said its economy grew at a better-than-expected pace in the latest quarter. European stock indexes finished mixed before Trump began his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could dictate where the war in Ukraine is heading. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.31% from 4.29% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 3.75% from 3.74% late Thursday. ___ AP Writer Teresa Cerojano contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

US futures rose while oil prices slipped. China reported data showing its economy was feeling pressure from higher US tariffs in July, while property investments fell further. Retail sales rose 3.7 per cent year-on-year, down from 4.8 per cent in June, while investments in factory equipment and other fixed assets rose a meager 1.6 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent growth in January-June. Uncertainty over tariffs on exports to the United States is still looming over manufacturers after President Donald Trump extended a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days following a 90-day pause that began in May. The Shanghai Composite index added 0.5 per cent to 3,683.58, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.2 per cent to 25,216.45. “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support,” ING Economics said in a market commentary. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 gained 1.2 per cent to 43,152.55 after the government reported that the economy grew at a 1 per cent annual pace in the April-June quarter. That was better than analysts had expected. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi edged less than 0.1 per cent higher to 3,225.66. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 8,909.20. Taiwan's TAIEX gained 0.3 per cent. Attention later Friday will likely focus on an update on US retail sales and on a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, seven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1 per cent to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1 per cent from its record set the day before. The inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3 per cent last month at the US wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5 per cent rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for US shoppers as higher costs make their way through the system. G-Secs rally on S&P’s rating upgrade for India The data led traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for US households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. Higher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller US stocks tumbled a market-leading 1.2 per cent. Thursday's disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That's a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find. Iron ore set for weekly decline on China's weakening property demand But a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term. Big Tech stocks helped mask Wall Street's losses. Amazon rose 2.9 per cent to add to its gains from the prior day when it announced same-day delivery of fresh groceries in more than 1,000 cities and towns. Because Amazon is so huge, with a market value of $2.45 trillion, the movements for its stock carry much more weight on the S&P 500 than the typical company's. In other dealings early Friday, US benchmark crude lost 16 cents to $63.80 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 13 cents to $66.71 per barrel. The dollar edged lower to 147.14 Japanese yen early from 147.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.1665 from $1.1654.

Title: The Role of Domain-Driven Design in Modern Java Architectures

Time Published: 2025-08-15T05:50:00Z

As Java continues to evolve with modern language features and frameworks, software architecture must also mature. One approach that has stood the test of time—and gained renewed relevance in microservices, modular monoliths, and cloud-native systems—is Domain-Driven Design (DDD). In this article, we explore how DDD principles apply to modern Java applications, what patterns emerge in practice, and how embracing the domain model as a core design driver helps create robust, maintainable software in complex environments. At its core, DDD is not a technical framework, but a philosophy: it encourages developers to align code structure and language with business concepts. Instead of building applications around CRUD operations or database schemas, DDD advocates modeling software based on real-world domains, behaviors, and rules. In the Java ecosystem—where enterprise applications often reflect deeply layered systems—DDD offers a language to manage this complexity while keeping the focus on what matters most: the business logic. The need for DDD is greater than ever: Java, especially with tools like Jakarta EE, Spring, Quarkus, and Micronaut, is well-positioned to support DDD principles across large systems. A bounded context defines the scope within which a particular domain model is valid. In Java, this can map to a microservice, module, or package. The goal is isolation—not just in code, but in language and purpose. One team’s definition of “Order” might differ from another’s, and that’s okay—as long as the contexts are clear. Java developers benefit from strongly typed languages, making it easier to express business rules directly in code. Class and method names should reflect the domain’s vocabulary. This promotes better communication between developers and domain experts and ensures the code remains readable and relevant. An aggregate is a consistency boundary, typically anchored by a root entity. In Java, this aligns with object-oriented principles. However, modern best practices caution against the anemic domain model—where entities are mere data holders—and instead promote rich domain models with encapsulated behavior. Events are a powerful way to model state changes and intentions in a system. In Java, these can be implemented using asynchronous event buses, messaging systems, or even simple publish/subscribe patterns. They decouple components and make the system more observable and extensible. Today’s Java architectures allow for clean DDD implementation without over-engineering. Hexagonal (or “ports and adapters”) architecture, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and event sourcing are all patterns that align naturally with DDD thinking. Frameworks and libraries like Spring Boot, Axon Framework, and even Jakarta EE support these patterns by offering tools to separate concerns and organize business logic meaningfully. While DDD offers a powerful mindset, it’s not a silver bullet. Challenges include: Domain-Driven Design isn’t a trend—it’s a timeless approach to building meaningful, resilient software. In a world where business logic is more complex and systems are more distributed than ever, DDD helps Java developers stay focused on what matters: modeling the problem space accurately and delivering solutions that evolve gracefully. Modern Java provides all the tools needed to make this vision practical—from powerful modularization features and frameworks, to evolving language constructs that support better encapsulation and readability. In embracing DDD, Java teams can bridge the gap between technical excellence and business value—one domain at a time. We will contact you soon. Δ Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry reveals fresh bets on Meta, Alibaba, and UnitedHealth
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/big-short-michael-burry-stock-portfolio-alibaba-meta-unitedhealth-buffett-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-15T01:45:27Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry bet big on stocks in the second quarter, swapping out bearish put options for bullish call options and adding several fresh holdings to his portfolio. The investor of "The Big Short" fame revealed in a quarterly filing on Thursday that he purchased calls on Alibaba, ASML, JD.com, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Meta, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and VF last quarter. Burry's Scion Asset Management also built direct stakes in Bruker, Lululemon, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and MercadoLibre, while cutting his direct wager on Estee Lauder from 200,000 shares to 150,000. The UnitedHealth wager is notable as Warren Buffett, one of Burry's key influences, also invested in the health insurer last quarter via his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. Call options give investors the right to buy a certain number of a company's shares at a fixed price within a set period, allowing them to lock in a purchase price that may be lower than the market price. Similarly, investors can use put options to lock in a selling price, allowing them to profit from if the stock price declines. Scion is known for making big changes to its portfolio between quarters, but this was a particularly striking overhaul. At the end of March, it owned puts on Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, Nvidia, PDD, and Trip.com worth a notional $186 million, plus a roughly $13 million stake in Estee Lauder. Three months later, it held calls on nine stocks worth a notional $522 million, and a further six direct stakes valued at $56 million. It's worth underscoring that Burry may have rejigged his stock bets in recent weeks, and his disclosures may not paint a full picture of his investment strategy. Quarterly portfolio updates known as 13Fs only provide a snapshot of a firm's holdings with a six-week lag and exclude shares sold short as well as investments in private companies, foreign-listed assets, and non-stock assets such as bonds and real estate. Burry shot to fame after predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble — a wager that was immortalized in "The Big Short" book and movie adaptation. He's also known for making grave predictions of market crashes and recessions, investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock, and betting against popular assets such as Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, and the entire S&P 500 index.

August 14, 2025 19:25 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company, focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical productions globally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Misled the Market About its 2025 Revenue and Profit Growth Potential According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Novo Nordisk's representations regarding its growth potential were overstated and failed to account for the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion; (2) defendants misrepresented the likelihood that patients using compounded GLP-1s would transition to Novo Nordisk's branded alternatives; and (3) Novo Nordisk significantly overstated both the size of the GLP-1 market and its ability to penetrate that market to sustain growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on "lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025" for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to "the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expectations and competition." On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk's common stock declined from $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025.

Title: Capital Spending As The Key Market Driver?

ByRandy Watts ByRandy Watts, Contributor. In 2025, the U.S. economy has continued to chug along despite the headwinds of tariffs and trade dislocations, as well as the current war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. One of the sources of this economic strength has been capital spending by U.S. companies. The main driver has been the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) capacity, especially by the mega-cap technology companies Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Figure 1: Total U.S. Capital Expenditures, 1950–2025 Historically, consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Shockingly, according to a post by Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, AI spending exceeded consumer expenditures in the last two quarters, as shown in the graphic below. “So far this year, AI capital expenditures (capex), which we define as information processing equipment plus software, have added more to GDP growth than consumer spending,” Dutta said. Figure 2: U.S. AI Capital Expenditures versus Personal Consumption (PCE), 2022–2025 Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal calculates that U.S. AI spending exceeded $100 billion in the previous quarter alone. "The AI infrastructure buildout is so gigantic that in the past six months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than all of consumer spending. The Magnificent Seven spent more than $100 billion on data centers and related infrastructure in the past three months alone,” Mims wrote. Figure 3: Capital Expenditures of META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, 2018–2025 As we discussed in October 2024, there are many sub-groups related to this spending, including the following O’Neil Industry Groups. Table 1: AI/Data Center-Related O’Neil Industry Groups A potential accelerant to overall capital spending comes from accelerated depreciation changes included in the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill. This law allows companies to deduct 100% of the depreciation of any qualified project or property in the first year it goes into service. This reduces a business’ taxes and helps improve near-term cash flow by reducing taxable income. This deduction covers most machinery, industrial equipment, computers, servers, and software, as well as some furniture, fixtures, and building components. As a result, we expect capital spending to rise over the next 12 months in AI and beyond. Thematic areas that may benefit include Power/Electrification, Aerospace, Industrial Manufacturing, Transportation, Telecommunications, and Life Science/Pharma. Across U.S.-based stocks with a market cap above $500M and at least $50M in annual sales, we analyzed ratios to identify potential beneficiaries. Then, we broke them down by O’Neil Major Industry (89 Groups, combines some of the 197 O’Neil Industry Groups together). 1) Percent of D&A versus sales (most recent annual period): used to find the most capital-intensive businesses, normalized for company size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 4.5%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 2: Percent of D&A versus Sales of O’Neil Major Industries 2) Percentage of D&A versus total assets (most recent annual period): used to gauge how quickly businesses utilize their capital base, normalized for capital base size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 3.0%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 3: Percent of D&A versus Assets of Major O’Neil Industries Major industries that appear on the left side in both of the above tables include Oil and Gas–Exploration/Production, Telecommunication Services, Metal Product and Fabrication, Oil and Gas–Integrated, Chemical, Shipping, Pollution Control, Semiconductors, Cement Aggregates, Agricultural Operation, Leisure Services, Trucking, and Paper and Forest Products. A handful of Health Care segments appear in the D&A versus sales table, while several Retail groups appear in the D&A versus assets table. Of the groups with higher ratios in each table (33 unique), the groups below are leading and/or reasonably well set-up from a technical perspective. Figure 4: Weekly Mini Charts of Key O’Neil Major Industries Despite the potential accelerated depreciation catalyst, tariff headwinds remain. In particular, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft—which track new orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for durable capital goods designed to last more than three years—have seen mixed momentum. While orders are up from 2024 levels (Figure 5), they have recently pulled back (Figure 6) as businesses put off capital investments despite the tax advantages granted by the Big Beautiful Bill. Figure 5/6: U.S. Manufacturing Orders and Order Growth, 2022–2025 Overall, much like the Trump corporate tax cuts in his first term, we believe the benefits from the change in depreciation expensing are being underemphasized by the market. While capital goods orders have been weak recently, we think they will rise from current levels as the new law takes effect and tariff uncertainty eases. The above industry lists and charts provide fertile ground for investors interested in this theme. We expect select beneficiaries of the new law to deliver notable stock price outperformance over the next 12 months, and we encourage readers to incorporate this view into their current investment strategy.

Full Content:
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a position in embattled healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group and reported smaller stakes in longtime holdings Apple and Bank of America, according to a regulatory filing Thursday. Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) at the end of the second quarter held 5 million shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) valued at about $1.6 billion. The company has likely been accumulating shares since the fourth quarter of last year, when it first asked regulators to let it build a position in secret to avoid a price spike. Shares of UnitedHealth Group jumped more than 10% in extended trading Thursday. Berkshire also opened smaller new positions in security products provider Allegion (ALLE), homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI), Lamar Advertising (LAMR), and steelmaker Nucor (NUE), all of which saw their stocks rise after hours. T-Mobile (TMUS) was Berkshire’s sole exit. The conglomerate sold the entirety of its $1 billion stake in the telecommunications giant. It also offloaded nearly half of its Charter Communications (CHTR) holdings. Berkshire made smaller cuts to two of its largest holdings, selling 20 million of its 300 million Apple (AAPL) shares and 26 million of its 630 million Bank of America (BAC) shares. Buffett began paring Berkshire’s stakes in both last year. Buffett scooped up 3 million shares of Chevron (CVX), another of his biggest holdings, and left stakes in longtime investments Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP) untouched. Berkshire slashed its exposure to banks in the first quarter, exiting its position in Citigroup (C) and trimming its holdings of Bank of America and Capital One (COF). On the flip side, the firm added to some of its food and beverage holdings, including alcohol maker Constellation Brands (STZ) and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). In the second quarter, the firm seemed to favor homebuilders. On top of entering D.R. Horton, Berkshire bought about 7 million shares of competitor Lennar (LEN), upping its stake from just 150,000 shares. Berkshire shares have shed about 11% of their value since Buffett announced in early May that he would step down as CEO at the end of 2025. Still, the stock is up almost 6% since the start of the year.

Amazon's got some mojo. The tech and retail giant's stock has been a middling performer among the big names for much of the year. It was essentially flat in the first half, while a popular Magnificent 7 exchange-traded fund moved higher and both underperformed the benchmark S&P 500. More recently, shares of Amazon (AMZN) have shown substantial life. They finished Thursday up nearly 3%, extending Wednesday gains and leaving them just over 5% for the year—fifth-best among the group of seven tech giants year-to-date. Behind the latest bump: enthusiasm for yesterday's announcement that it would extend a move into fast delivery of fresh groceries, seen as a shot across the bows of other retailers and delivery companies. (Think Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART) and Kroger (KR), for example.) Several Wall Street analysts applauded the move, which followed a second-quarter earnings announcement that disappointed some investors. "Fresh grocery has been a significant missing piece in Amazon's offering [versus] competitors," Bank of America wrote, naming Walmart and Target (TGT). "With better grocery capabilities, Amazon should see important customer frequency benefits and potential lock-in." Morgan Stanley estimates that offline grocery spending is worth about $1.5 trillion in the U.S., or nearly half of all offline consumer spending. Fresh and perishable goods, they write, are about 45% of that total; Amazon, they said, was at risk of losing grocery market share before its latest move. Better grocery service could also boost the value of Prime membership, according to JP Morgan analysts, who think the company could raise membership prices next year without significantly causing churn or eating into customer acquisition. Amazon is widely liked by Street analysts, who according to Visible Alpha are unanimously bullish. The current consensus price target, near $262, suggests a roughly 13% premium to Thursday's close. That's a solid enough outlook—to be sure, some Magnificent Seven stocks managed double-digit gains in the first half of 2025 alone—but CNBC's Jim Cramer, to name one observer, is now talking about a "new narrative" for the company. Based on the stock's latest rise, investors were eager to hear one.

August 14, 2025 16:40 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=161266&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Most US stocks fall after a disappointing inflation update, but Big Tech keeps Wall Street steady

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — Most stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday after a disappointing report said inflation was worse last month at the U.S. wholesale level than economists expected. But gains for Amazon and some other influential Big Tech companies helped mask the losses. Seven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1% to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped by less than 0.1% from its record set the day before. The inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3% last month at the U.S. wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5% rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for U.S. shoppers as it makes its way through the system. The data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. “This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” but it may raise some doubt, according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. Traders now see a 7.4% chance that the Fed may hold rates steady in September, according to data from CME Group. A day earlier, they were betting on a 100% certainty that the Fed would cut its main rate for the first time this year. Higher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. stocks tumbled a market-leading 1.2%. Thursday's disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That's a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find. But a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term. The data helped send Treasury yields higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.28% from 4.20% just before the data reports’ release and from 4.24% late Wednesday. On Wall Street, Tapestry tumbled after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade New York brands showed it's feeling the pressure of tariffs. It detailed how much profit it could lose in its upcoming fiscal year because of tariffs and duties, and its forecast for profit fell short of analysts’ expectations even though its forecast for revenue came in above. Its stock fell 15.7%, despite it also reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Deere fell 6.8% even though the machinery maker likewise delivered a better profit than expected. There, too, the focus was on where profits are heading. It cut the top end of its forecasted range for profit this fiscal year and said its customers “remain cautious amid ongoing uncertainty.” On the winning side of Wall Street was Fossil Group, which jumped 29.8% after the seller of watches and other accessories reported better profit than expected. It also announced a plan to strengthen its finances, while trimming its forecast for how much it expects worldwide net sales to fall this year. Big Tech stocks also helped mask Wall Street's losses. Amazon rose 2.9% to add to its gains from the prior day when it announced same-day delivery of fresh groceries in more than 1,000 cities and towns. Because Amazon is so huge, with a market value of $2.45 trillion, the movements for its stock carry much more weight on the S&P 500 than the typical company’s. All told, the S&P 500 rose 1.96 to 6,468.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 11.01 to 44,911.26, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 2.47 to 21.710.67. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Asia and Europe ahead of a key meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.

Ark Invest added 2,532,693 shares of BLSH in total across three of its actively managed ETF funds—ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF—as shares hit the market at the conclusion of the Bullish IPO. Here's every move Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made in the stock market today 8/13 pic.twitter.com/UStxQzSn36 — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) August 14, 2025 Bullish, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange and owns crypto media publication CoinDesk, offered shares in its firm for $37 as part of its IPO yesterday. But the stock quickly rose after trading began, reaching as high as $118 in the first afternoon of trading. The feat mirrors the explosive debut of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, which completed its IPO in June and quickly gained nearly 4x when it hit the market—outpacing IPOs from noted tech firms like Meta and Airbnb when they made their debuts. Ark Invest maintains exposure to Circle too, holding more than 4.2 million shares of CRCL across its ETFs, now valued at more than $626 million. It maintains exposure to crypto in other ways too, with combined holdings of more than $1.5 billion in shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and brokerage Robinhood (HOOD), both of which fall inside its top 10 holdings overall. It also holds around $17 million worth of shares in crypto exchange eToro (ETOR). Ark also has its own Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, which added $36.6 million in funds on Wednesday and holds more than $2 billion in assets according to data from Farside Investors. The success of Bullish’s IPO adds fuel to the accelerating trend of crypto firms seeking entwinement with public markets. Other exchanges like Gemini and OKX have signaled their interest in IPOs, with the former confidentially filing its intentions in June. Others, like FalconX and Kraken, are rumored to be in the mix as well. Shares of BLSH are up once more on Thursday, jumping nearly 10% to $74.60, bringing ARK’s holdings to nearly $189 million.

According to Fundstrat research, Ether could climb much higher before the end of 2025, with price targets ranging from $10,000 to as high as $15,000. Reports show Ether jumped about 60% over the past 30 days and hit a four-year high near $4,770 in early trading, while other coverage put the token at $4,694 and noted a 78% surge over an eight-week stretch. Those moves have pushed Ether close to its all-time peak, and fund managers are taking notice. According to Fundstrat’s chief information officer Tom Lee and head of digital asset research Sean Farrell, institutional forces and new rules are key drivers. They point to stablecoin work and tokenized projects being built mostly on Ethereum, and they cite regulatory efforts such as the GENIUS Act and the SEC’s so-called Project Crypto as factors that could speed Wall Street’s move onto blockchain rails. Based on data, Ethereum holds a commanding 55% share of the $25 billion real-world asset tokenization sector, a stat that Fundstrat uses to argue for broader institutional adoption. Reports have disclosed large-scale corporate accumulation that several analysts say is taking supply off the market. BitMine Immersion Technologies has reportedly added about 1.2 million ETH since early July, leaving the company with roughly $5.5 billion worth of Ether on its books. Company stock (BMNR) has been volatile, with some coverage pointing to a 1,300% jump over a short period. Fundstrat and other observers say those kinds of corporate treasuries, combined with fresh ETF flows, could create a structural bid for ETH if the buying is sustained. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, described these positions as strategic and long-term, saying they remove “substantial liquidity” from trading pools. According to Fundstrat, Ether is outperforming Bitcoin this year. One set of figures put ETH’s year-to-date gain at 28% against Bitcoin’s 18%, while other reports more recently showed ETH up 41% YTD and Bitcoin up 30% YTD, with BTC trading near $121,000 in that snapshot. Based on reports, Fundstrat’s analysts view ETH as a major macro trade for the next 10 to 15 years if institutional and regulatory trends continue to push demand higher. Analysts caution that lofty targets will need sustained, large inflows to become reality. Watch for the pace and consistency of ETF flows, corporate treasury disclosures, and any regulatory moves around stablecoins and custody rules. There’s also a practical concern: big, concentrated buys can tighten markets quickly but may also reverse if sentiment shifts or liquidity needs change. According to analysis and public comments from Fundstrat, the bullish case for Ether is clear and backed by specific numbers: $10,000 to $15,000 targets, corporate treasuries holding millions of ETH, and rapid recent gains.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Stocks: Analyzing TSM Vs. TSMY For Your Investment Strategy
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/taiwan-semiconductor-stocks-tsm-vs-tsmy/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T18:32:39Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Taiwan Semiconductor is a major player in the global chip trade. And the one-year-old fund TSMY is trading derivatives on TSM stock to produce eye-popping dividends. Does one of these securities deserve a place in your portfolio? Let's find out. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited is the world’s largest dedicated chip foundry, which has a global market share of nearly 65%. The company manufactures semiconductors under contract for clients, including the world's largest tech companies. TSM is the ticker for Taiwan Semiconductor's ADR. An ADR or American depository receipt is a U.S.-traded stock that represents a foreign company's equity. ADRs generally have the same rights as the original stock. If the TSM ADR were not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, interested investors could only buy equity in the company by purchasing ticker 2330 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. TSMY is an actively managed ETF by YieldMax ETFs. TSMY buys and sells options on TSM stock to produce income and realize limited gains when TSM stock appreciates. The fund does not invest in TSM or 2330 stock directly. Options give the holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a security at a certain price within a specified timeframe. TSMY's options strategy is complex. It involves selling call options without owning the underlying security. Instead of owning TSM directly, the fund uses other financial contracts to replicate TSM price movements. Additionally, the fund uses U.S. Treasury securities for collateral and additional income. TSM and TSMY are fundamentally different assets. The table below highlights some key differences. TSM stock represents a direct equity position in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor. When you own the stock, you own a slice of the company—including future profits and dividends. Owning TSMY provides no ownership position in TSM or any right to TSM dividends. Instead, the fund provides indirect TSM exposure through options contracts. These contracts are designed to provide income and create limited gains when TSM stock appreciates. TSM comes with the usual risks of stock ownership. Your position can lose value or stop producing dividend income without warning. This stock has a beta of 1.2, meaning it is 20% more volatile than the overall market. TSMY has the same risks, but with an added dimension of complexity. Options trading is inherently risky because it creates leverage—meaning you can participate in a stock’s price changes with less capital than what's required to own the stock directly. With leverage, you can lose or gain more than you've invested. TSMY manages the risk with layers of options to isolate its exposure. One outcome is that larger gains from TSM may not fully flow through to the fund. More specifically, if the stock appreciates enough, the fund will have losses on its short positions that limit the upside for shareholders. TSM stock has gained 43.7% over the past year. Including the modest dividend yield of 0.9%, the total return was 45%. TSM has also appreciated 213.4% over the past five years. TSMY was launched in August 2024. Since inception, the share price has declined 27.2% or $5.87. The fund has paid $8.27 in dividends, however. That nets to a total return of about 11.1%. TSM’s current P/E ratio is 28.15, which is down from its 2024 P/E of 31.16 and higher than its five-year average of 22.64. All three values compare favorably to the average industry P/E of 55.72, which considers 67 stocks in the semiconductor space. Note that TSM manufactures chips, while other semiconductor companies like Nvidia outsource this function, often to TSM. The foundry business is more capital-intensive, and therefore riskier, than fabless chip design—so their P/E ratios aren’t wholly comparable. TSMY's net asset value per share is $15.89, and its share price is $15.77. In other words, the fund trades at a slight discount to the value of its assets. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is prone to double-digit swings in short timeframes. For example, between January and March of 2025, TSM stock fell 17.4%. And since the end of March, the stock has gained 37.6%. The volatility is a function of several factors, including global chip demand, high-speed computing trends, supply chain factors and evolving global trade policies. Global chip demand directly affects TSM, since it is the dominant market-share leader in semiconductors. Projections for the industry in 2025 and beyond continue to be optimistic. Deloitte predicted $697 billion in global chip sales this year, with the potential for $1 trillion by 2030. AI is the most talked-about driver of global chip demand because the world's largest tech companies are racing to build out their high-performance computing power. But semiconductors are an integral part of several high-profile industries, including 5G communications, autonomous driving, fintech, cybersecurity, cryptocurrency, healthcare and manufacturing. While the pace of the AI buildout could slow, ongoing demand from other industries will continue. The semiconductor supply chain involves chip foundries, chip designers and providers of machinery, tooling, test equipment and raw materials. These players are located all over the world, so there is also a heavy logistics component in this space. Meeting the increasing demand for semiconductors requires efficient collaboration throughout the supply chain. Historically, supply chain issues have been disruptive. For example, pandemic-related supply problems prompted a global chip shortage in 2020. The outlook on the semiconductor value chain remains mixed. In 2024, Boston Consulting Group reported on increased resilience fueled by pro-innovation policies in several countries and geographic diversification. More recently, Graham Scott, vice president of global procurement at Jabil, had a less positive view—noting the potential for "significant disruptions to the global supply chain." U.S. President Donald Trump is currently reshaping global trade with an aggressive tariff agenda. How the new levy structure will affect the complex semiconductor supply chain is still unknown. Issues to watch include the new 50% tariff on copper and U.S.-China trade negotiations. Copper is used extensively in chip fabrication. And China supplies 95% of gallium and germanium, two raw materials necessary for certain semiconductors, according to McKinsey. Four covering analysts currently rate TSM a buy. The consensus price target is $258.33, which implies almost 7% upside from the current price of $241.47. Since June 1, analysts from Susquehanna and Barclays have raised their TSM price targets. Morningstar, the leading provider of fund ratings, does not cover or rate TSMY. However, Morningstar rates TSMY's parent, YieldMax ETFs, as below average. The rating commentary notes, "YieldMax ETFs has not been able to demonstrate that it has a unique value proposition over other asset managers." If your strategy involves increasing your semiconductor exposure, opt for TSM. It provides direct semiconductor exposure in a familiar equity package. If you're interested in growing your income portfolio, there are many other income funds with more diversification and less risk than TSMY. TSMY's distribution yield is impressive, but that yield is less meaningful when it accompanies a per-share price decline. TSMY's net result so far has been a good, but not great, total return. Bottom Line TSM is a top semiconductor stock, and TSMY is an options fund that doesn't directly own equity in TSM or any other company. Unless you have a spot in your portfolio earmarked for income-producing derivatives, TSMY is likely too risky. TSM, on the other hand, may fit in your holdings if you can accept the risks and volatility of the semiconductor space. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. What Are The Main Differences Between TSM And TSMY ? TSM is a stock that provides an equity position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. TSMY is an actively managed ETF that writes and sells call options on TSM stock to produce income, without investing TSM stock directly. Do Both TSM And TSMY Pay Dividends? Both TSM and TSMY pay dividends. Shareholder payouts from TSM are standard quarterly dividends, paid from excess cash flow. TSMY payouts are monthly and include option income. Can I Hold Both TSM And TSMY In My Portfolio? You can hold TSM and TSMY simultaneously. Holding both may create a concentration risk, depending on what else is in your portfolio.

Title: SpaceX Warns Virginia’s Internet Program Will Be A ‘Massive Waste of Federal Taxpayer Money’ For Overlooking Starlink

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/14/2025 9:21:43 AM PDT by MagillaX SpaceX warned on Wednesday that Virginia is planning to spend over ten times what was required for its proposed high-speed internet access program by not sharing a large chunk of the incentives for Starlink. In a letter addressed to the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development, SpaceX said that the final proposal for the program was a “massive waste of federal taxpayer money,” before noting that SpaceX could have served virtually every eligible household at $60 million, compared with the $613 million in expenditure proposed by the Commonwealth. “Simply put, Virginia has put its heavy thumb on the scale in favor of expensive, slow-to-build fiber bias over speedy, low-cost, and technology-neutral competition,” SpaceX wrote in the latter as Virginia chose the Elon Musk-headed company for only 5,579 of the total 133,000 locations selected for subsidized broadband installations. The program at the center of the controversy is called the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD), an $42.5 billion initiative of the Biden administration to enhance internet access for Americans across the country. The Trump administration tweaked the program to shift from fibre-based broadband to ‘technology neutrality’ and paved the way for satellite broadband providers such as Starlink and fixed wireless service providers. Retail sentiment on Stocktwits about AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), another satellite broadband provider, was in the ‘bullish’ territory at the time of writing. SpaceX further alleged that, according to Virginia’s current plan, Starlink will receive $3.2 million in funding, which translates to approximately $584 per site, while faster fiber installations can cost around $6,000 to $8,000 per site. The company said that Virginia “failed to observe technology neutrality,” before adding that Starlink could provide faster broadband and “at one-tenth of the cost.” (Excerpt) Read more at in.investing.com ...

And hard to tell friend or foe at times. Louisiana put forward their proposal with a cap of competitive 8k per service while Virginia was nearly double. And may be the reason no complaint has been levied by StarLink on Louisiana. There are legitimate concerns for Low Earth Satellite and there are some interesting opportunities it presents as well.

It looks like this is Internet for low income people, not involving things like 911 services and such. (The Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD), an $42.5 billion initiative of the Biden administration to enhance internet access for Americans across the country.) In the article it also said: "...The Trump administration tweaked the program to shift from fibre-based broadband to ‘technology neutrality’ and paved the way for satellite broadband providers such as Starlink and fixed wireless service providers..." To me, this is just more proof that the grown-ups are in charge. This makes sense. We don't need high end/high speed Internet access for people who aren't able or willing to pay for it. We need the most inexpensive option, and if SpaceX is right (it says in the article that SpaceX asserts: "...SpaceX could have served virtually every eligible household at $60 million, compared with the $613 million in expenditure proposed by the Commonwealth...") then absolutely they should have been considered. However, as Freeper MagillaX astutely points out: The deep state sees fiber as an infrastructure jobs package. And maybe with some political kickbacks. That is no doubt true, and how the Democrats and Deep State view this kind of thing. This anecdote illustrates the vacuousness of that point of view: "...Milton Friedman was once visiting China when he was shocked to see that, instead of modern tractors and earth movers, thousands of workers were toiling away building a canal with shovels. He asked his host, a government bureaucrat, why more machines weren’t being used. The bureaucrat replied, “You don’t understand. This is a jobs program.” To which Milton responded, “Oh, I thought you were trying to build a canal. If it’s jobs you want, you should give these workers spoons, not shovels!” 8 posted on 08/14/2025 10:27:28 AM PDT by rlmorel (Factio Communistica Sinensis Delenda Est.)

We laid millions of miles of copper, because that is all we had. Now it is all about cellular. In other countries they jumped straight to cellular, especially where the terrain was mountainous or the population decentralized. Not perfect but much more achievable. We also built out a cable TV network, only to have it replaced by Internet connections. And we used to complain about the cost of cable TV bundling, but today we volunteer to pay for podcasts, apps and YouTube. 9 posted on 08/14/2025 11:33:14 AM PDT by texas booster (Join FreeRepublic's Folding@Home team (Team # 36120) Cure Alzheimer's!)

Thankfully the vast majority of people (perhaps even including you) don’t need 2Gb of internet bandwidth. Your provider, like all others and even commercial data center networks, do a thing called over subscription.

To me, this is just more proof that the grown-ups are in charge. This makes sense. We don't need high end/high speed Internet access for people who aren't able or willing to pay for it. We need the most inexpensive option, and if SpaceX is right (it says in the article that SpaceX asserts: "...SpaceX could have served virtually every eligible household at $60 million, compared with the $613 million in expenditure proposed by the Commonwealth...") then absolutely they should have been considered. However, as Freeper MagillaX astutely points out: The deep state sees fiber as an infrastructure jobs package. And maybe with some political kickbacks. That is no doubt true, and how the Democrats and Deep State view this kind of thing. This anecdote illustrates the vacuousness of that point of view: "...Milton Friedman was once visiting China when he was shocked to see that, instead of modern tractors and earth movers, thousands of workers were toiling away building a canal with shovels. He asked his host, a government bureaucrat, why more machines weren’t being used. The bureaucrat replied, “You don’t understand. This is a jobs program.” To which Milton responded, “Oh, I thought you were trying to build a canal.

My cabin has fiber available so that’s what I use. The lake doesn’t, so Starlink is the best choice. One size doesn’t fit all here. As to whether Starlink gives you 2Gb, no. It doesn’t. Thankfully the vast majority of people (perhaps even including you) don’t need 2Gb of internet bandwidth. Your provider, like all others and even commercial data center networks, do a thing called over subscription.

We need the most inexpensive option, and if SpaceX is right (it says in the article that SpaceX asserts: "...SpaceX could have served virtually every eligible household at $60 million, compared with the $613 million in expenditure proposed by the Commonwealth...") then absolutely they should have been considered. However, as Freeper MagillaX astutely points out: The deep state sees fiber as an infrastructure jobs package. And maybe with some political kickbacks. That is no doubt true, and how the Democrats and Deep State view this kind of thing. This anecdote illustrates the vacuousness of that point of view: "...Milton Friedman was once visiting China when he was shocked to see that, instead of modern tractors and earth movers, thousands of workers were toiling away building a canal with shovels. He asked his host, a government bureaucrat, why more machines weren’t being used. The bureaucrat replied, “You don’t understand. This is a jobs program.” To which Milton responded, “Oh, I thought you were trying to build a canal.

We laid millions of miles of copper, because that is all we had. Now it is all about cellular. In other countries they jumped straight to cellular, especially where the terrain was mountainous or the population decentralized. Not perfect but much more achievable. We also built out a cable TV network, only to have it replaced by Internet connections. And we used to complain about the cost of cable TV bundling, but today we volunteer to pay for podcasts, apps and YouTube. I prefer “fiber”... Can Starlink provide 2 GB input to me like fiber does? Can the chicoms attack Starlink? Can the chicoms attack the fiber cables? Can the chicoms attack the fiber cables? — Ever wonder how signals get to your fiber cable? Yikes! Are you implying that it's not a fiber fairy? Losing the tooth fairy was bad enough, but losing the fiber fairy will be devastating... Losing the tooth fairy was bad enough, but losing the fiber fairy will be devastating... “ I prefer “fiber”... Can Starlink provide 2 GB input to me like fiber does?” I prefer fiber as well. That said, I have a vacation place on a lake where fiber isn’t an option and isn’t commercially feasible. The people these types of programs are intended to help are typically in areas that are difficult to service with fiber which is why it hasn’t been done already. My cabin has fiber available so that’s what I use. The lake doesn’t, so Starlink is the best choice. One size doesn’t fit all here. As to whether Starlink gives you 2Gb, no. It doesn’t. Thankfully the vast majority of people (perhaps even including you) don’t need 2Gb of internet bandwidth. Your provider, like all others and even commercial data center networks, do a thing called over subscription. Your connection may be able to achieve 2Gb download, but you won’t come close to that if everyone was trying to do so at the same time. I had an opportunity yesterday to do a speedtest on Starlink. The guy to whom it belonged had bought the lowest class service at 50 GB/month. Speed was 420 MB/s down and about 15 up. Impressive.

Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Defendants represented that Sable Offshore Corp. had restarted oil production off the coast of California when it had not; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Lockheed Martin lacked effective internal controls regarding its purportedly risk adjusted contracts including the reporting of its risk adjusted profit booking rate; (2) that Lockheed Martin lacked effective procedures to perform reasonably accurate comprehensive reviews of program requirements, technical complexities, schedule, and risks; (3) that Lockheed Martin overstated its ability to deliver on its contract commitments in terms of cost, quality and schedule; (4) that, as a result, the Company was reasonably likely to report significant losses; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Lineage was then experiencing sustained weakening in customer demand, as additional cold-storage supply had come on line, the Company’s customers destocked a glut of excessive inventory built up during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Company’s customers shifted to maintaining leaner cold-storage inventories on a go-forward basis in response to changed consumer trends; (2) that Lineage had implemented price increases in the lead-up to the IPO that could not be sustained in light of the weakening demand environment facing the Company; (3) that Lineage was unable to effectively counteract the adverse trends listed in the foregoing through the use of minimum storage guarantees or as a result of operational efficiencies, technological improvements, or its purported competitive advantages; (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, rather than enjoying stable revenue growth, high occupancy rates, and steady rent escalation as represented in the Registration Statement, Lineage was in fact suffering from stagnant or falling revenue, occupancy rates, and rent prices; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

U.S. equities were lower at midday as wholesale inflation rose more than expected in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all down.

Deere & Co. (DE) also lowered its outlook, saying its customers remain cautious about spending. Shares of the big farm and construction machinery maker sank. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) shares crashed when the auto parts retailer cut its earnings guidance after taking on a new $1 billion loan. Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL) shares rose after the owner of properties for oil and gas exploration announced it was dual listing its stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the new NYSE Texas exchange in Dallas.

Title: Adtech Stocks Tumble as AI, Increased Competition Weigh on Revenue

A turbulent Q2 earnings season has divided the adtech sector, as investors sell off shares of The Trade Desk, PubMatic, and Viant. Compared to the NASDAQ Composite, indicative of the broader market’s health, adtech stocks are trending down. Few firms, including AppLovin and Criteo, have been able to weather the selloff. Experts say the latest figures underscore the challenges facing adtech companies today; chief among them is competition with Big Tech titans who are increasingly entering their territory. The sector is now “operating in a market dominated by Google, Meta, and Amazon—three vertically integrated giants that collectively control the lion’s share of digital ad spend,” said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next. “They not only run the largest ad networks but also own the platforms, data, and exchanges, allowing them to extract value from every part of the digital supply chain—often at the expense of publishers, advertisers and adtech companies.” Add in the complexities of navigating the AI boom—which is causing upheaval in how people search and stifling publisher traffic—and adtech companies are finding themselves in a new kind of pressure cooker. Demand-side platform The Trade Desk basked in Wall Street’s good graces throughout 2024 and into early 2025, as its share price soared and Q1 revenues achieved 26% year-over-year growth. But the tides have quickly turned: The stock plunged nearly 40% late last week on the back of the company’s Q2 earnings report, which showed slowing revenue growth and heightened competition from Big Tech firms like Amazon. CEO Jeff Green insisted on a call with investors that “Amazon is not a competitor.” Financial analysts expect a declining growth rate for The Trade Desk throughout the second half of the year. PubMatic, a leading sell-side platform, cited changes by a top demand-side partner in July for revenue hiccups. Its stock is down about 20% since earnings were reported Monday, and more than 30% over the last two weeks. The company’s CEO Rajeev Goel said on a call with investors that “a top DSP buyer shifted a significant number of clients to a new platform that evaluates inventory differently, impacting our revenue.” He added that PubMatic plans to “diversify ad spend away from legacy DSPs.” MNTN, the CTV darling that shot to prominence with the help of Ryan Reynolds and his creative agency Maximum Effort, saw shares tumble after reporting its first-ever earnings on the back of a May IPO. Only a few major firms have been able to weather the adtech selloff. Chief among them is AppLovin, which helps developers monetize mobile apps with ads. In June, AppLovin sold off its mobile apps business, which spurred increased investor confidence and netted it.$400 million in cash. The stock saw double-digit growth last week after it reported Q2 earnings that showed a 77% jump in revenue year-over-year, to $1.26 billion. AppLovin surpassed The Trade Desk last year to become the largest adtech company by market cap. Zeta Global, which positions itself as an AI-powered marketing cloud platform, has seen increased investor interest over the last two weeks. Criteo, a commerce-focused DSP, is also holding its own, even as rivals pose a growing threat. Meanwhile, the two leading ad verification vendors, Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify, were split. IAS’s stock spiked after an August 7 earnings report that included better-than-expected publisher performance, plus an adjusted EBITDA of $109.84 million. DoubleVerify, however, fared poorer. The firm beat revenue estimates, but missed on earnings per share. The adtech sector is entering the back half of 2025 with investor sentiment sharply divided, compounded by anxieties over AI and macroeconomic uncertainty in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs and steady inflation. Some analysts are confident about the industry as a whole, but see this selloff as a sign of splintering and increased competition. “Adtech companies are in a surprisingly solid place, by which I mean most businesses are running well enough with low double-digit growth on average, and mostly with growing profitability,” said Brian Wieser, principal and CEO of Madison and Wall. “If there’s a problem, it’s that there is no consolidator, and so the business seems likely to remain a fragmented, almost cottage industry, with a large number of mid-sized companies but few giants.” Kendra Barnett is Adweek's senior tech reporter.

Oracle has reportedly announced job cuts within its cloud division, reflecting a trend among companies managing expenses in light of escalating investments in AI infrastructure. Employees were informed week commencing 10 August, of their role eliminations, reported Bloomberg citing sources familiar with the situation. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Some of the layoffs were attributed to performance-related factors, although the division continues to recruit new talent. Reports indicate that more than 150 positions were eliminated in the Seattle region, which has historically been a key area for the cloud unit. Following its decision in 2024 to relocate its headquarters to Nashville, Oracle currently lists more job openings in Tennessee than in any other state. An Oracle representative did not respond to Bloomberg’s several requests for comment, and the complete extent of the job cuts remains unclear. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The initial report on the reductions was provided by DatacenterDynamics, a publication focused on industry news. In July 2025, the company secured a significant agreement with OpenAI for around 4.5GW of data centre power in the US. However; Oracle faces substantial financial commitments, amounting to tens of billions of dollars, to expand its server farms to accommodate growing demand. The company reported negative free cash flow for the fiscal year ending in May 2025. In a filing from June 2025, Oracle noted that it regularly adjusts its workforce in response to strategic shifts, reorganisations, or performance issues. The company stated, “These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring.” In response to the rising costs associated with AI, several major technology firms have implemented workforce reductions. Microsoft has laid off approximately 15,000 employees in 2025, while Amazon and Meta Platforms have also made similar cuts.

Title: To Make Democracy Work, Give More of It to Workers

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The fight to reclaim American democracy has to begin with our oligarchic political economy. An Amazon worker affiliated with the Teamsters on strike at a company delivery hub in Maspeth, Queens, last year. The 2024 election was a referendum on democracy—one that democracy lost fair and square. As loudly and as forcefully as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic Party as a whole argued that Donald Trump posed a threat to America’s democratic institutions, he was reelected with both an Electoral College majority and the Republican Party’s first popular vote plurality in 20 years. The polls suggest many wound up backing Trump for economic reasons—as troubled as they might have been by his antidemocratic rhetoric and effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the hope that Trump could ease the cost of living won out over the warnings about his authoritarianism and the democratic abstractions that became central to the Harris campaign’s closing message. That was only partially the Harris campaign’s fault—by habit, we tend to fret about the state of our political institutions and the state of our economy separately. But our understanding of democracy, and our defenses of it, should be shaped by materialism—an understanding that economic conditions and alignments of economic power determine the extent to which the governed can govern. Our Constitution, for instance, was profoundly shaped by economic conditions at the time it was written. Troubled by the demands struggling Americans were making of government after the American Revolution, our founders designed a federal system that frustrates our ability to democratically address our economic concerns and other matters to this day. And money in politics today has made matters worse—on top of the Constitution’s antidemocratic design, corporations and the wealthy shape policy in ways visible and invisible to ordinary Americans on the outside looking in. Fixing the latter problem would take more than imposing new limits on how the economic elite can directly engage in politics, as important as that goal remains. Corporations and the wealthy exert their political influence through a variety of indirect channels, from the media to their social circles. This means that an ordinary American would still wield far less political power—and be far more subject to political domination—than a millionaire or billionaire even with major campaign finance and lobbying reforms. But another way to counter the domination of the wealthy in our politics would be to democratically restructure the economy—granting the American worker more agency and ensuring that economic power and resources accrue to more than a wealthy few in the first place. In doing so, we’d not only reduce inequality to the benefit of our political institutions, but also, of course, to the material benefit of everyday Americans—demonstrating that democracy is worth fighting for not just as a political abstraction but a means of improving our working lives. In the 1980s, the democratic theorist Robert Dahl posed a key question often overlooked in both our political reform and economic policy debates: “What about the ownership and control of economic enterprises as a source of political inequality?” Ownership and control contribute to the creation of great differences among citizens in wealth, income, status, skills, information, control over information and propaganda, access to political leaders and, on the average, predictable life chances, not only for mature adults but also for the unborn, infants, and children. After all due qualifications have been made, differences like these help in turn to generate significant inequalities among citizens in their capacities and opportunities for participating as political equals in governing the state. As Dahl observed, the design of our basic economic institutions—including the structure and ownership of companies—clearly matters. It’s plain that our efforts to tackle inequality will be incomplete unless we’re willing to address how they produce inequality to begin with. And beyond the fact that the wealth and economic power that accrues to investors and those at the top of firms is leveraged for influence within our political institutions, the subordination of workers is also democratically troubling in itself. We spend roughly a third of our lives at work and earn our livelihoods there. The decisions made in corporate boardrooms and on Wall Street often affect us more directly, immediately, and intimately than decisions that are made in Washington or in our state capitols and city halls. Yet most Americans take it entirely for granted that we’re not entitled to a say in how the companies we work for function. This should change. If democracy is desirable because it gives us a measure of agency over the conditions that shape our lives—helping us master our own fates rather than living as the mere subjects of the powerful or the victims of circumstance—we should work to bring democratic values into the economy. Though we’ve long forgotten it, the coming of “economic democracy”—and, specifically, democracy within firms—was once seen as an inevitable development by many thinkers and political figures, particularly in the first half of the last century. In the aftermath of World War II, for instance, the philosopher John Dewey predicted that the conflict would lead to a democratic revolution in industrial organization. “It is so common to point out the absurdity of conducting a war for political democracy which leaves industrial and economic autocracy practically untouched,” he wrote, “that I think we are absolutely bound to see, after the war, either a period of very great unrest…or a movement to install the principle of self-government within industries.” That didn’t happen. But for a time, the postwar economy did deliver Americans a measure of economic democracy—thanks to the growth of the American labor movement. While much of the economic growth and prosperity America experienced in the decades immediately following the war was spurred by the social and economic investments of a federal government much bigger and bolder than ours is today, economies are built upon the backs of workers. The drivers and the miners, the clerks and the cooks, those who build and fix and clean and carry, those who staff the factories and the shops—whatever politicians and their donors say about the wealthy “job creators” at the top of companies, it’s the job doers to whom we owe everything. And for generations, job doers seeking a greater share of the prosperity they produce have turned to labor unions. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, guaranteed most private-sector workers the right to organize and to bargain for better pay and working conditions. As a result, union membership spiked—in the 12 years after its enactment, nearly 11 million Americans joined up. In 1935, about 13 percent of the country’s workforce had been unionized. By 1955, that proportion jumped to roughly one-third of American workers. Beyond getting the American people a better deal at work, unions used that newfound strength to push the New Deal and Great Society agendas forward—by politically organizing and mobilizing their workers, unions helped win the fights for Medicare and other major programs. Both in the workplace and at the ballot box, unions played a significant role in ensuring that the gains from our economic growth flowed to workers and not just the already wealthy. According to one 2021 paper, increasing union membership alone likely explains nearly a quarter of the decline in American inequality from 1936 to 1968. And while union families earned 10 to 20 percent more in income than nonunion families between the 1940s and the 2010s, unions also made nonunion workers better off than they otherwise would have been—to compete with union workplaces for new hires and to keep their employees content, even nonunion workplaces wound up offering better pay and working conditions. The gains unions delivered for American workers should be understood as the products of economic democracy. After all, workers form unions by majority rule — either in elections administered by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or by an employer’s voluntary recognition that a majority of its workers in a given unit have signed cards to form a union. Once unionized, workers are able to exercise real agency through bargaining and to voice their ideas and concerns about work in ways that are protected by law. Naturally, the wealthy and their backers in Washington fought back against the growth of unions as quickly and as doggedly as they could. In 1947, over a veto by President Truman, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which imposed a laundry list of restrictions on union activity and included other measures to limit their growth. Among the most significant of them was granting states the ability to pass “right to work” laws, which are often framed as granting workers the right not to join a union. But American workers never have to join unions if they don’t want to—workers who don’t want to be members of a union at their workplaces can instead pay fees that cover the costs of the union’s bargaining activity on their behalf rather than actual union dues. What “right to work” laws actually do is starve unions of resources by ensuring workers in unionized workplaces don’t have to pay unions anything at all. The proliferation of those laws and the other limitations on labor organizing imposed by the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act put the brakes on the growth of the labor movement. And further disempowering it became one of the cornerstones of the economic agenda that formed in the wake of an economic downturn in the early 1970s—an all-out assault on the policies of the New Deal and the Great Society. Unions were tamed, taxes were slashed, government programs were gutted, government functions were privatized, industries were deregulated, jobs were enthusiastically sent overseas, and finance took up a greater share of our economic activity. Policymakers assured voters that these changes would eventually deliver economic freedom and prosperity to all Americans. But on the whole, this agenda made the wealthy wealthier and more powerful while ordinary working Americans struggled to adjust. The result has been steadily deepening inequality. And few changes were as dramatic or consequential as the fall of the labor movement. From its peak at roughly one-third of the American workforce in the 1940s and 1950s, union membership has declined to about 10 percent of the workforce today, including just 6 percent of the private-sector workforce. According to one estimate, the decline in union membership since 1968 accounts for about 10 percent of the increase in income inequality America has seen since then. According to another, when the impact on the hourly wages of nonunion members is factored in, the decline of unions likely explains as much as one-fifth of the rise in wage inequality among American women and one-third of the rise among American men working in the private sector from 1973 to 2007. Companies are working hard to cripple unions even further. Although the Wagner Act prohibits them from explicitly firing or punishing workers for trying to unionize, U.S. employers spend more than $400 million a year on consultants who specialize in discouraging or thwarting unionization efforts with a variety of tactics that skirt the edges of legality. And even when companies engage in flagrantly illegal activity—firing unionizing workers, say, or spying on employees who are organizing—the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot directly impose monetary penalties on them for breaking the law. That weakness has made employers brazen. In recent years, major firms such as Starbucks, Chipotle, Walmart, and Trader Joe’s have not just fired workers trying to organize but have also shut down entire stores with ongoing union activity, supposedly for unrelated reasons. And as union organizers know well, even when a union is formed, negotiating a labor contract can be a long, drawn-out process, thanks in substantial part to the company’s stalling tactics. This landscape, combined with the growing difficulty of organizing, has taken power away from workers and given an increasing share of it to executives and wealthy investors on Wall Street. In recent years, unions and advocates hoping to wrest that power back have united in support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act—the most significant piece of proposed legislation for organized labor since the Wagner Act. An override of state right-to-work laws; a ban on forced anti-union meetings at work; a ban on permanently replacing striking workers; a ban on forcing employees to waive their right to class-action lawsuits; civil penalties for violations of the Wagner Act; and a presumption in law that workers are employees rather than independent contractors unless employers can prove otherwise—these and the PRO Act’s other provisions would be utterly transformative, making it easier to organize unions, bolstering their power, and extending new protections to all workers, both union and nonunion. Still, more could be done. Federal labor law could be changed so that a union is automatically formed and recognized by the NLRB once a majority of employees in a given unit sign cards authorizing one—without the need for a separate election. And workers should have the right to bargain over more in union contracts than “wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment,” as the Wagner Act currently allows. Harvard Law’s Sharon Block and Benjamin Sachs have noted that workers have mounted internal protests at a variety of firms recently over issues like climate change and the injustice of Donald Trump’s immigration policies. As they argue, “the democratic principles that give workers a claim to voice over wages and hours similarly demand workers have voice in these other decisions that their firms make and that have profound impacts on the workers and their communities.” What’s more, the Wagner Act has never covered public employees or agricultural and domestic workers. Federal law should grant them the same labor rights as all other workers. It should also end at-will employment by establishing that workers can be fired only for just cause—a reform that would not only grant American workers a basic protection afforded to nearly all other workers in the world, but also facilitate the formation of unions by making it more difficult for employers to invent reasons for firing union organizers and pro-union employees. It should also be established that federal labor law, once reworked, should be the floor for labor protections in this country rather than the ceiling. States and localities should be allowed to pass labor laws of their own, provided they are at least as protective of unions and workers as federal legislation is. While these policies would surely rejuvenate and expand unions, it must be remembered that even at peak membership, the vast majority of American workers have never been represented by a union—thanks, in part, to a system that forces workers to organize themselves piecemeal, individual workplace by individual workplace. To broadly unionize retail workers as a whole, for instance, would require unionizing countless individual workplaces at a multitude of companies across the retail sector—an extraordinarily daunting task. Expanding the reach of union contracts could help here. Unions have at times been able to negotiate master contracts that cover workers at multiple companies. Labor law could be changed to help make those agreements more common—once workers at a few workplaces reach similar contracts, for instance, the law could have those contracts automatically cover other newly organized workers in the same region and sector, without each workplace having to negotiate separate agreements. Policymakers could also more fundamentally transform labor law by instituting sectoral bargaining—a system in which representatives of employers and unions come together to negotiate over and set basic pay and conditions for workers across entire sectors of the economy all at once. On bargaining panels, those representatives might craft and vote on agreements that (for example) set a minimum wage-and-benefits package for all retail workers in a given state or region, rather than waiting for workers to organize unions and negotiate contracts store by store. New union chapters could then focus on negotiating issues specific to each workplace, or try to push for even better pay and conditions than the minimums established by the bargaining panels. Sectoral bargaining has a number of advantages beyond being a quicker and easier way to improve things for workers than depending solely on traditional union organizing. For one thing, companies might be less resistant to improving pay and conditions for workers if all their competitors were made to do the same in a sectoral agreement. (As matters stand now, one reason companies fight hard against unions is that they fear spending more on their workers will put them at a competitive disadvantage against their rivals.) For another thing, sectoral agreements could address the now-common management strategy of “fissuring” workers in contracting arrangements and gig-economy employment by protecting all workers doing the same kind of work. “It matters not whether someone is employed directly, is employed by a subcontractor or by a franchisee, or is an independent contractor,” Block and Sachs explain. “If they work in the sector, they are covered by the sectoral collective bargaining agreement.” But perhaps most important of all, sectoral bargaining panels—each a kind of legislature governing work in a particular sector—would be a remarkable instantiation and expansion of economic democracy. And that would be especially so if all the workers in a sector could elect the union members who represent them on each panel. As dramatically different as sectoral bargaining would be from the status quo, the seeds for it have already been sown. At various points over the last century, the federal government established boards and committees with business and labor representatives to set or advise on wage standards. And in recent years, policymakers in states and cities across the country have established similar “wage” and “workers’ boards” to set or advise on wages and working conditions—such as California’s Fast Food Council or Colorado’s board for direct care workers. Efforts like these should be expanded and made more fully democratic—allowing for the election of worker representatives by workers themselves—on the way to true sectoral bargaining in America. Unions and bargaining are far from the only ways that we might build democratic agency for workers. Here, US policymakers should take a page from Europe—with reforms that would give workers a direct say in business decisions. One such reform would be to have businesses institute work councils—bodies of representatives, elected by workers, that are consulted on working conditions, firings and layoffs, and other matters directly affecting employees’ lives at work. While councils in most countries are merely informed of certain impending decisions, a few countries like Sweden and Germany have given their councils a degree of real authority over working conditions. Contrary to what skeptics might assume about the business sense of granting worker representatives that much power, research has shown that work councils have no impact on a firm’s profitability. If anything, they may increase productivity—perhaps by offering workers forums in which they can discuss and solve problems. That makes work councils a good supplement for traditional unions: They can address new or specific issues in the workplace atop the contracts that unions have already negotiated. They can offer workers a voice in workplaces where a union has yet to be organized. The fear that work councils could be used to manipulate workers—through representatives undermined, selected, or controlled by managers—led to the adoption of provisions in the Wagner Act that essentially banned them in the United States. But those concerns should be allayed by new laws mandating that companies put councils in place when workers themselves demand them, and protecting such assemblies from the interference of bosses (much like the Wagner Act’s protections for those trying to organize unions). Workers should also be given democratic power at much higher echelons of corporate governance. In some countries, companies are required, under an arrangement known as codetermination, to reserve for their workers a portion of the seats on their governing boards, ensuring that ordinary employees get at least some say in decisions that might otherwise be left wholly to executives and investors. Germany’s system is perhaps the most well known and widely studied. There, most companies with 500 to 2,000 employees are required to have their workers elect one-third of the supervisory board that chooses and manages the executives running the company. Most companies with at least 2,000 employees are required to have their workers elect one-half of that board. And, as with work councils, research suggests that firms with codetermination are as or more productive than others. In 2018, Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would have required all corporations on the stock market to let workers elect at least one-third of their board of directors. This was followed by presidential-campaign proposals from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Warren would have required companies collecting at least $1 billion in revenue to let workers elect 40 percent of their boards. Sanders would have had all companies on the stock market, as well as companies with at least $100 million in assets or revenue, let their workers elect 45 percent of their board. Either way, the Warren and Sanders proposals would have applied to companies employing roughly 30 million workers. Under the Baldwin, Warren, and Sanders plans, employee power would obviously be limited. As is just about universal in all codetermination schemes, worker representatives would have only a minority of seats on each board. Still, granting workers elected seats at the table where corporate decisions are made would significantly empower them. Even with a minority of seats, worker representatives could deeply influence corporate governance by casting key votes on issues where other board members might be split, and ensuring that matters important to workers are raised for discussion. And they could use that influence to help bolster the democratic power of workers elsewhere—by pushing back against company efforts to discourage or frustrate union organizing, for instance, or by trying to rein in political contributions to anti-union candidates and groups. But even if workers were on their boards, companies would still fundamentally be accountable to those who own them— founders, executives, and anyone else owning company shares. For public companies, that includes Wall Street investors who buy and profit from stock sold in the markets without contributing anything whatsoever to a company’s operations and success. Shareholders can vote on corporate matters— including selecting company board members—and the dividends that boards decide to pay out. A company’s actual employees, on the other hand, are generally entitled to none of this. Unless their employers are generous, they earn nothing more from the wealth their work produces than their pay and benefits—no shares or income as their companies do well, no votes as shareholders. Even with all the reforms explored above, those wealthy or well-placed enough in the company to own stock would still be calling the shots. Given all that, workers should also be owners, entitled to an ownership stake in the companies they work for. Some already are. According to Rutgers professor Joseph Blasi, about 10 to 20 percent of companies on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have substantial programs where some stock is either granted to employees or offered to them at a discount. That includes corporations such as Alphabet (Google), Apple, ExxonMobil, Ford, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. And at some private companies, employees can come to own a substantial proportion of shares. The supermarket chain Publix, for instance—one of the top 10 largest private US companies—is fully owned by its 250,000 employees and its founder’s family. For years now, the primary vehicle for achieving worker ownership at that scale in the United States has been the employee stock-ownership plan (ESOP). In an ESOP, a company’s stock is gathered from various sources and placed in a trust for employees, who receive an allocation of shares that the company can buy back from them for cash once they retire. About 6,500 companies employing some 14 million workers—about 10 percent of the private-sector workforce—have ESOPs today. Roughly 2,000 of them are wholly owned by their employees. And research suggests that employee ownership is both good for workers and good for business. Companies with ESOPs tend to grow faster and are more productive after starting such plans than they would have been otherwise. Privately held ESOPs are also less likely to go bankrupt, and ESOP workers are less likely to be laid off. While some might assume that companies with ESOPs would compensate for the stock given to employees by reducing wages, evidence shows that the wages of employees at such firms may, if anything, be higher. Sophie Hurwitz Burhan Azeem, Teresa Mosqueda, Zo Qadri, and Anna Brawley Stacey Abrams Steve Bullock From a democratic perspective, most ESOPs have one key limitation: Workers usually lack a direct voice in corporate governance as shareholders. Instead, ESOPs are run by trustees, who vote for employees on most matters (except major changes, such as a company’s sale or merger). Yet they can be structured differently. Employees could be allowed to vote directly on more matters, for example, or they could be given the right to control the votes cast by trustees. The tax and other government incentives and supports that flow to ESOPs could be amended specifically to encourage the formation of ESOPs of this kind. In 2019, Bernie Sanders proposed another democratically promising and ambitious model for worker ownership, inspired by an idea floated by the UK’s Labour Party. Under his plan, the federal government would pass a law requiring all companies on the stock market and all companies with at least $100 million in revenue or on their balance sheets to establish what he called Democratic Employee Ownership Funds (DEOFs), controlled by worker-elected trustees. Each company would then gradually place 20 percent of its stock into its DEOF over 10 years. And workers at each company would have the right to vote through their portions of stock in the fund, just like any other shareholders. In plainer terms, the Sanders plan would have given workers ownership and control over 20 percent of every major company in the country—every big corporation you’ve heard of and thousands more besides, employing some 56 million Americans. And their ownership stakes would entitle workers to both full voting rights as shareholders and additional income from dividends worth, according to one analysis, an average of at least $2,622 per worker per year at publicly traded companies. As far-reaching and transformative as Sanders’s own proposal is, evidence suggests there may be public support for taking it even further. In 2019, a survey found that a majority of Americans would support companies with more than 250 employees transferring as much as 50 percent of their stock to worker funds, making them halfway worker-owned and worker-controlled. Beyond ESOPs and the funds envisioned by Sanders, there are fully fledged worker cooperatives—companies directly owned and controlled by their workers. In a cooperative, the divisions between workers and managers are eroded or erased to establish self-government. Collectively, it’s up to the workers in a cooperative to decide what the business should do, and then to do it. The profits, like the employees’ responsibilities, are divvied up among themselves. The worker-cooperative sector in most countries is small. In the United States it is positively tiny—by one estimate, there are perhaps 1,000 such enterprises in America, employing some 10,000 workers. But cooperatives are nonetheless instructive, illustrating how much workers are capable of when left to their own devices—and how well democracy at work can function as a practical matter. Consider Spain’s Mondragon Corporation, perhaps the best-known collection of cooperatives in the world, which employs tens of thousands of workers across some 95 firms in a variety of industries. “The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers,” New Yorker contributor Nick Romeo wrote in 2022. “The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker, a gas grill, a car—were made at Mondragon.” In general, cooperatives—as large as Mondragon or much smaller—tend to be about as profitable and grow about as much as traditional companies, while offering their workers more job security. They do come with their own unique challenges— worker congresses, like all congresses, do not always work well, and full participation in cooperative governance can demand a lot from workers. But they’re a viable and democratically empowering business model, and we could do more to foster them. States can pass legislation laying out how cooperatives should be incorporated to help them comply with state laws built around more traditional businesses and secure funding from banks. Tax breaks and loans can be offered to help start cooperatives or convert existing businesses into them. And more worker-ownership centers, like those in Sanders’s Vermont, could be founded with government support to offer them resources and technical assistance. Pursuing the agenda described here would remake the American economy once again, this time to the benefit of America’s workers—reducing inequality, improving the conditions of their working lives, and dramatically expanding their democratic agency in ways that will pay off not only at work but within our politics. Empowering workers and the unions advocating on their behalf could hamper the anti-worker political activities of their employers. And putting more money in workers’ pockets could facilitate democratic participation—it’s much harder to be an involved and attentive democratic citizen, after all, if you’re not sure how you’re going to pay your bills next month. But economic democracy would bolster political democracy in another way. Democracy is a vastly complicated thing; like all complicated things, engaging in it well takes practice. Habits and skills, such as learning how to present and debate one’s ideas, when and how to compromise, and how to critically assess and synthesize different sources of information before coming to a decision, are critical for democratic life. Ideally, we’d be better at them than we seem to be today; we might improve if we gave ourselves the chance to work on such skills more often, between and beyond elections. Economic democracy—whether through participating in unions, electing work councils, voting as shareholding workers, or working in full-fledged cooperatives—gives us the opportunity to hone those skills at work, where we come together with people often very different from ourselves to achieve things big and small. Through work, democracy could be made more concrete to those who’ve come to doubt it—understood, materially, as the means by which raises can be won and problems in our daily working lives that trouble us can be solved, rather than as abstractions bandied about by politicians who always seem to promise more than they accomplish. In this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump. We’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel. The Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here? At The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

Title: AI Is A Money Trap
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Title: AI Is A Money Trap

Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Title: AI Is A Money Trap

Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Study computer science or related aspects of information technology, get a job at Chipotle? Artificial intelligence appears to be subsuming many coding and technology jobs, according to a recent gloomy article by The New York Times' Natasha Singer. "The spread of AI programming tools, which can quickly generate thousands of lines of computer code -- combined with layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft -- is dimming prospects in a field that tech leaders promoted for years as a golden career ticket," Singer wrote. Also: Want a job in tech? You need these skills, McKinsey study shows There are three ways of looking at AI in terms of career prospects. One is the job-killer, noted above. Another is to immerse oneself in AI development and oversight skills, which are in demand. Then there's a third option. AI may be the lever that lifts professionals' paths into the startup space, opening up abundant opportunities. Ultimately, it may help people more successfully launch and guide their startups. "AI makes it easier for founders to launch new enterprises, said Spiros Margaris, a leading global venture capitalist in the fintech space and founder of Margaris Ventures. Margaris shared his perspectives on startup opportunities with us. "With the right large language models and data skills on your team, you can automate a significant portion of your operations, test ideas faster, spend less, and reach profitability sooner, if customers like what you're offering." Also: Can you build a billion-dollar business with only AI agents (yet)? This author thinks so AI could help wring out some of the risk that accompanies launching one's own venture -- the fear factor that stops people in their tracks from leaving the formal job market. Almost half of the one million startups started annually within the US will fail within the first five years, according to tracking data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Eventually, up to 90% will fail, due to competition, misguided product strategies, or overwhelming costs. AI's greatest advantage for testing new business ideas is speed. "What used to take months or years can now be prototyped and tested in weeks," Margaris said. "Just as we saw with fintech democratizing the financial industry, we're seeing the same with AI. It allows smaller players to level the playing field against large corporations by providing capabilities that previously required deep pockets, investments that only large corporations could afford. Now, thanks to AI innovations, these capabilities are accessible with far fewer resources." At this point, AI should be at the core of most, if not all, startups, he added. "Many startups were already using AI in some form before ChatGPT changed the game. Even those not using it yet are figuring out how to integrate it into their strategy. If you want to survive, grow, and raise money, becoming AI-first isn't optional anymore." Also: A year after Altman said superintelligence was imminent, GPT-5 is all we get? AI is being leveraged everywhere in today's startup scene. "Fraud detection, marketing, e-commerce, hiring, coding, you name it," said Margaris. "Machine learning was already in play before OpenAI reset our expectations of what's possible. Look at Meta's recent numbers: No matter how massive AI spending seems, it's only going up, and the payoff is coming faster than most industry observers thought possible. As AI advances its capabilities, startups will continue finding innovative ways to use the technology to their benefit and ultimately ours." There are even observers who say it's possible for an individual -- or very small team -- to build a billion-dollar business with now widely available AI tools. At the same time, AI adds more complexity to startup scenarios, said Margaris. "AI isn't a free lunch, even if it feels magical when it works. It can reduce risk, help with compliance, and improve auditability, but it can also create new headaches. It's two sides of the same coin." He added that cybersecurity also needs to be at the forefront of new ventures. "The threats are getting sharper as AI is used both to defend and attack. That's a fight every startup must be ready for, and it will only become more complex with issues like intellectual property disputes and data privacy regulations." Also: The AI complexity paradox: More productivity, more responsibilities Margaris has advice for those wishing to start a new business and how AI can help. "Build a team that understands AI, data science, governance, and ethics. Never lose sight of the AI regulatory environment, which could have a profoundly negative impact on your business if you don't monitor it closely." Importantly, "tools don't win; people do," he said. "A great driver will beat a good one in the same car. It's the same with AI. The right team and mindset make all the difference. My advice? Dive in and start experimenting now. If you hesitate, your competitors won't and they'll capture your market before you've even started."

Mayor Adams vetoed two City Council bills late Wednesday that would boost minimum wages for grocery delivery workers to more than $20 an hour — a move that came after his top aide, Randy Mastro, launched an internal advocacy effort against the measures, according to sources familiar with the matter. The mayor, whose own Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner lauded the bills as recently as late last year, had until midnight Wednesday to veto the measures or they would have lapsed into law. With just over six hours to go until the deadline, Adams announced he had used his veto pen to block both bills, arguing they would result in higher grocery prices — an issue that has become a big focus on this year’s mayoral campaign trail. In a statement, Adams argued the increased wage requirements would result in grocery delivery companies jacking up prices on their customers, which he said includes seniors, people with disabilities and SNAP beneficiaries. “Grocery prices are already too high, so now is not the right time to do anything to drive these prices even higher. Unfortunately, Intro. 1135-A and Intro. 1133-A would do just that at a time when too many working-class New Yorkers are struggling,” the mayor’s statement said, using the index numbers for the measures. Sources familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Daily News that Adams has in recent weeks been advised by Mastro, his first deputy mayor, to use his veto pen to block the bills. The sources said Diane Savino, a senior adviser to Adams at City Hall, has also been involved in the talks with Mastro and the mayor. The internal convos came after Amazon and Instacart, two major grocery delivery companies, launched an aggressive lobbying campaign urging Adams to block the bills. Targeting officials in Adams’ office and at the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Amazon and Instacart have made the same argument that the measures would result in higher grocery prices for their customers and also warned of potential layoffs of delivery workers. “We thank Mayor Adams for recognizing this reality,” Tom McNeil, Instacart’s senior government affairs manager, said after his vetoes. Council Democrats passed the two bills with veto-proof majorities, meaning they could move to override the mayor’s attempt to block them. Julia Agos, a spokeswoman for Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, said after the vetoes that the chamber’s Dems are “considering our next steps” and “will always stand up for workers in our city.” Agos also accused the mayor of “parroting inaccurate talking points” about increased grocery costs. Supporters of the bills have argued third-party delivery platforms would face increased costs, not grocery stores. “This veto demonstrates that the mayor’s claims to care about working-class New Yorkers and a sustainable delivery industry for New York City are hollow, because he is undermining the workers who make the sector possible,” Agos said. “Without fair wages and protections for delivery workers, there is no sustainable industry, just exploitation.” One of the two bills, Introduction 1135, would over time require third-party companies like Instacart to pay grocery delivery workers a minimum wage of $21.44. That level matches the minimum wage the city set for restaurant delivery workers earlier this year — a reform that the mayor supported. The second bill, Introduction 1133, would ensure that any companies with “contracted” workers performing delivery services are protected by the same wage requirements. The 1133 bill was specifically designed to ensure Amazon would be covered by the new wage rules. Amazon owns WholeFoods, the grocery store chain, so their delivery workers could be defined as closer than third-parties, leading the Council to enact the second bill to plug any potential loophole. The vetoes come after a December 2024 Council hearing, in which Adams’ Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, whose agency oversees wage laws for delivery employees, said she wanted to “enthusiastically commend” the Council for advancing the bills. “There are many more New York City delivery workers in need of DCWP protections,” she testified. Adams spokesman Zachary Nosanchuk said the administration’s views have changed since the December testimony as grocery prices have continued to increase. Grocery prices, and cost-of-living concerns more broadly, have been hotly debated during this year’s mayoral race. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral nominee who’s polling as the favorite to replace Adams, has vowed to if elected open city government-run grocery stores to try to bring down costs of essentials. In a press conference before the mayor’s vetoes, Mamdani said he hoped he wouln’t try to block the bills. “I think it goes against what so many New Yorkers are calling for, which is a wage they can actually live off of,” he told reporters. To date, the Council has overridden Adams three times on legislative vetoes, including when he tried to block a bill placing new transparency requirements on NYPD officers. The Council is gearing up to override yet another veto Adams issued earlier this month to kill a bill decriminalizing unlicensed street vending. Mastro’s involvement in pushing the mayor to veto the grocery delivery bills comes as he has become known at City Hall for his aggressive management style. Since becoming Adams’ top deputy this spring, Mastro has pushed to reverse several Adams administration initiatives, including a plan to build affordable housing in Manhattan’s Elizabeth Street Garden as well as a new composting fine structure on landlords.
