A FORMER SCHOOL principal convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30-year period has been jailed for four years for some of the offences, with further sentencing to follow for the others. Aidan Clohessy (85) was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. Imposing sentence in the first case against him today, Judge Elva Duffy said Clohessy was “living a life full of good deeds during the day” but was also “an ogre” who carried out “what can only be described as atrocities at night time, when no one could see that behaviour”. Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co. Dublin from the 1970s until 1993. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disabilities at that time. The boys were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co. Dublin, was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. Today, he was sentenced four years in relation to the offending against these two boys. Judge Duffy noted Clohessy’s age and health would make custody more challenging for him. The jury in the second trial returned guilty verdicts on five counts of indecent assault – two for one boy, and one count each in relation to three other boys. All this offending took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. Having heard evidence in this case today, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence. Victim impact statements were read to the court on behalf of all six injured parties. They outlined how the abuse affected their mental health, relationships, education and later employment opportunities. One man said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day, you will be handed your judgement.” Another said he struggled to learn his wedding vows or to read his children a story. Clohessy was interviewed voluntarily by gardaí and denied wrongdoing. He acknowledged that corporal punishment was used in the school, including by him. Clohessy told gardaí this included striking boys on their bare buttocks, but said this was only for the most serious offences and only of those boys who were residents at the school. The investigating gardai agreed with Ronan Kennedy SC, defending, that his client was co-operative during the investigation. The garda further agreed that Clohessy has been the subject of adverse media publicity. Kennedy told the court his client will not be appealing the jury’s decision in either trial. Clohessy is originally from Co. Limerick and entered the religious order after completing his Leaving Certificate in 1958. He initially trained as a psychiatric nurse and after some years working in this area, retrained as a teacher. Clohessy started work at St Augustine’s School in 1969, becoming principal in the mid 1970s. Kennedy said his client served in roles on the provisional leadership team and was appointed in 1993 to lead a mission in Malawi to develop mental health services there, where he remained until 2013 when he returned to Ireland. Kennedy said Clohessy lives “a humble and quiet existence” and supports other members of the religious community who have significant health issues. A medical report and two testimonials were handed to the court on Clohessy’s behalf. Kennedy asked the court to take into account his client will find custody more difficult due to his age and health issues. He submitted that his client would have to live with the stigma of being a sex offender and has already been subject to negative publicity. “In many respects, he was already condemned and judged in the court of public opinion before he was ever tried in this court,” Kennedy said. An investigating garda outlined the evidence of the first trial to the court. The first boy was aged around 10 when he went to St Augustine’s School in 1973. Advertisement In the first incident, the boy, who was a boarder, had returned to the chalet and was making a sandwich when he heard the front door open. He knew it was Clohessy. Clohessy called the boy “demon” and said he had to get the demon out of him. The boy was taken to a room, where Clohessy slapped him on his bare buttocks and touched his testicles. The court heard there were other similar incidents including occasions when the boy felt something wet on the small of his back. On one occasion, the boy felt something in his buttocks, didn’t know what it was, but knew Clohessy had done it. The court heard there is no suggestion that this was an object. The abuse ended when the boy was around 11 or 12. A victim impact statement was read to the court by the injured party’s wife. He said the pain “imposed on me as a child has never truly gone away” and has “shaped every part of what I became”. He developed trust issues and has had feelings of shame, confusion and fear. He said the trial brought a lot of that fear and trauma back to the surface. “It was like being haunted by the ghost of your own life,” he said. The man said the abuse took away his childhood and “stole my future” as he could not learn like other children and left school with limited literacy skills. He said he struggled to find work to support his family, and they had experienced financial pressures. Addressing Clohessy directly, he said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day you will be handed your judgement.” A second boy, who was also a boarder at the school, was around 11 when the first incident took place. He was in a changing area after he had taken part in a swimming race when Clohessy came in. Clohessy told the boy, “I told you to win the next time” and touched the boy, who was getting changed, in his genital area. In a separate incident on the same day, Clohessy called the boy over while walking past the chalets and touched him inappropriately. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion. The boy was in Clohessy’s office on another occasion when the principal told the boy to take down his clothing. The boy refused to remove his underwear and Clohessy pulled it down. The boy felt something hard on his buttocks, then something wet. The boy dried himself off and asked Clohessy why, but didn’t get an answer. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and said something like “son, no one knows”. The court also heard evidence about another incident in a storage area of the gym building where Clohessy touched the boy inappropriately. Clohessy said to him: “Son, I hope no one knows.” In a victim impact statement he said the abuse impacted his education, his mental health and his later employment. Imposing sentence, Judge Duffy said the age of the injured parties and that the offending took place on multiple occasions, were aggravating features. The judge noted the contents of both victim impact statements. She said these were “vulnerable children” who had been entrusted to Clohessy’s care. Judge Duffy noted the defence had indicated there would be no appeal and she expressed the court’s hope that this might offer some peace for the two injured parties in moving forward. The judge said she had read the testimonials and acknowledged that while Clohessy has “good elements”, this offending took place “in total secrecy”. She said she would impose two separate sentences of two years, to run consecutively. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Ethereum Co-Founder Projects Disruptive Global Dominance for Ethereum layer-1 (L1)

Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has taken to X to share his outlook on the future of the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain, which he believes is primed for global dominance. Lubin’s assertions are in response to the recently approved Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to clarify the use of stablecoins. The Ethereum co-founder can be seen on X, affirming the sentiments of an Ethereum supporter, who referenced Pro-Ethereum sentiments shared by Robbie Mitchnick, the head of Digital Assets at BlackRock. The BlackRock official, who appears to be bullish on Ethereum, previously revealed that Ethereum ranks as the first choice on the company’s radar, particularly when the investment firm begins to explore tokenization. On the other hand, Lubin highlighted some of the blockchain’s key features, including its permissionless nature and flexible structure, neutral state, and anti-censorship design, adding that the Ethereum blockchain is primed to continue on a decentralized path. “Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the world; Permissionless to inspect, use, and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral [and] censorship resistant. Tamper-resistant and tamper-evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing itself.” He wrote. Lubin stressed the role of the Ethereum community in strengthening the blockchain, hailing community members from developers to users, and applauding their commitment to the network’s core values. However, he maintains that network regulation is bound to become increasingly difficult as barriers are underway. “With a best-in-class giant community that is constantly hyper vigilant as there will always be patient, well resourcedactors working to subvert the system. Fortunately this will get harder and harder as Ethereum grows and matures.” He asserts.

Title: Is the $313 Million Ether Transfer to Coinbase Signaling Major Sell-Off?

A large Ethereum (ETH) transfer has sparked renewed fears of a potential market dump, just as leverage in the ETH futures market surges to record levels. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain flagged a massive transaction of 113,000 ETH—valued at approximately $313 million—deposited into crypto exchange Coinbase. The move was initiated from a single whale wallet amid heightened speculative trading activity and rising institutional accumulation of ETH. Whale deposits to centralized exchanges are often interpreted as a signal that large holders may be preparing to sell. Lookonchain reported the transaction on X, noting that the wallet had remained dormant for a considerable period before suddenly moving its entire holdings to Coinbase. While the motive behind the transfer remains unknown, such high-value movements often precede large sell orders, especially when combined with current market conditions. The timing of the whale deposit aligns with a new all-time high in Ethereum futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, ETH futures open interest has surpassed $29 billion, driven by increasing speculative activity using stablecoin-backed, cash-margined contracts. This trend is also reflected in the growing presence of retail traders in Ethereum’s derivatives market. CryptoQuant reported that futures trading frequency among smaller investors has spiked above its 12-month average, contrasting with Bitcoin’s stagnant on-chain activity. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, institutional demand for ETH has remained steady. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly acquired $163.6 million in ETH across two consecutive weeks, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,295, marking a slight 0.16% decline over the past 24 hours. Analysts have identified $2,800 as a critical resistance level. According to crypto traders such as Daan Crypto Trades and Duo Nine, a break above this threshold could lead to a push toward the $3,000 mark. However, with leverage peaking and large ETH volumes moving to exchanges, the market remains on alert for a possible correction. High open interest and excessive retail positioning have historically led to liquidations during sudden price swings. In contrast to bullish sentiment, some traders are beginning to open short positions on ETH. Lookonchain highlighted this divergence, suggesting that some market participants prepare for a downside move in response to the whale transfer and overheated derivatives activity. While Ethereum continues to enjoy institutional inflows and speculative momentum, the $313 million whale transfer to Coinbase has introduced a new layer of uncertainty.

Title: Coffee Break: Nihilists at Google Wrecking Existing Business to Chase AI Growth
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/?p=294347
Time Published: 2025-06-23T18:00:03Z
Full Content:
In 2016 Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that “in the long run, we’re evolving in computing from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world.” In 2018, he famously told Kara Swisher that AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.” It’s generally over-looked that he opened that statement by saying “We don’t take a very optimistic view of AI” and closed by responding to Swisher’s comment that “fire is pretty good” with “(fire) kills people too, we have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we have to overcome its downsides too.” And yet, just over four years later Pichai, by then also CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, issued a ‘code red’ and directed multiple department heads including those in charge of research, trust, and safety “to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of AI prototypes and products.” This directional switch took place only three weeks after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. At the time, The New York Times warned that “because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact” and “that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building.” The Times also quoted University of Washington professor Margaret O’Mara saying, “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.” That was in late 2022, as of mid-year 2025, it is clear that Pichai has damaged Google’s brand and its core search product in a seemingly competition with OpenAI. As I tried to understand what Pichai was doing, my initial framework was Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” concept defined as when “vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.” Over the past year I’ve found Ed Zitron’s analysis of Google’s decision-making has deepened my understanding of WTF Pichai is up to. I’ll come back to Zitron in a moment, but for those new to his work, I’d recommend giving these three pieces a quick skim: I’ve also found pioneering AI researcher Gary Marcus’ work very useful — he flagged most of the limitations of LLM AI decades ago and has been consistently vindicated in his skepticism that the current OpenAI and Alphabet approach to AI will truly prove “as important as fire.” We’ll come back to Marcus too. But first I want to touch on an idea that Naked Capitalism readers have seen recently in another context via Curro Jimenez: nihilism. Curro was quoting the French sociologist Emmanuel Todd’s analysis of Israel’s recent behavior in Gaza and Iran and this quote jumped out at me: “Perhaps in the unconscious depths of the Israeli psyche, being Israeli today is no longer about being Jewish — it’s about fighting the Arabs.” I would argue that for Pichai and those remaining at Google under his leadership, being Google today is no longer about being the dominant search engine — it’s about fighting OpenAi/ChatGPT. On Wednesday, I’ll be applying Todd’s formulation to the current leadership of the Democratic party which is no longer about being the party of the working class but rather it’s about fighting off the progressive wing of the party. Now, let’s dive into Ed Zitron’s explanation of why Google is willing to risk its incredibly lucrative core search business and maybe even destroy the open web itself in a quest to compete with Open AI. Zitron is an effective polemicist so let’s let him cook a little: Google no longer provides the “best” result or answer to your query – it provides the answer that it believes is most beneficial or profitable to Google. Google Search provides a “free” service, but the cost is a source of information corrupted by a profit-seeking entity looking to manipulate you into giving money to the profit-seeking entities that pay them. The net result is a product that completely sucks. …That’s because Google has, like every major tech company, focused entirely on what will make revenues increase, even if the cost of doing so is destroying its entire legacy. Google has announced their own “Bard AI” to compete with Bing’s ChatGPT integration, and I’ll be honest – I feel a little crazy that nobody is saying the truth, which is that Google broke the product that made them famous and is now productizing fixing their own problem as innovation. … Venture capital and the public markets don’t actually reward or respect “good” businesses or “good” CEOs – they reward people that can steer the kind of growth that raises the value of an asset. …Sundar Pichai isn’t paid $280 million a year because he’s a “good CEO.” After all, Google has all but destroyed its search product. He’s paid because he finds ways to increase the overall growth of the company (even while their cloud division still loses money), and thus the stock goes up. Zitron expanded on these ideas in his “Business Idiot” piece: Our economy is run by people that don’t participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don’t experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. Ewan Morrison elegantly summarized why Pinchai’s commitment to AI is so riskly to its search business and the Open Web itself: One drop of sewage in a glass of water turns the entire glass into sewage.This is happening with AI hallucinated facts on the internet. AI systems have 48% error margins & are turning our historical, news, philosophical & scientific info on the net into sewage.Do not drink it. pic.twitter.com/nN0dhV9Dg2 — Ewan Morrison (@MrEwanMorrison) June 19, 2025 And like Captain Ahab, Pinchai knows he must have a crew just as dedicated to his suicidal mission as he is. He might not be nailing a gold coin to the mast and demanding loyalty oaths, but he is aggressively pushing buy-out offers on Googlers who are not down with the program: Remember Google is offering buyouts to employees who aren’t all-in on how the company is doing things and it’s “AI first” direction. Sadly, I have to think that still working for Google at this point means they support what’s happened and how the company intends to become an an answer engine. — Katherine Argent (@effthealgorithm) June 21, 2025 Let me wrap with a couple of paragraphs from Freddie de Boer about the issues the whole of tech faces and why it thinks AI is the answer: the hype is a phenomenon driven by needs that are fundamentally financial in origin. The tech companies need a new suite of products that can restore their eroding profitability and inspire the public the way that the public was inspired in the late 2000s and early 2010s; the financial sector and investors need the tech companies to be the unicorn stocks that they once were. As usual with speculative capitalism, the tail is wagging the dog. When hockey stick growth does not emerge naturally from reality, it will be invented. Media hype about AI, the almost literal absence of any countervailing narrative, the relentless way that the stodgiest publications inflate the threats/hopes that have been invested in these technologies… it’s all downstream of the desire to feel about tech the way people did in the Obama era and the demand from the moneyed to have the right lottery tickets to buy. A lot of people who are used to getting what they want are looking to let the good times roll again, and “AI” is precisely the kind of vague instrument into which they can throw those hopes. Anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes is simply told that they don’t understand the technology, and every year that goes by that human life is not seriously disrupted by this technology is just a minor delay. Rinse and repeat. In future posts, I’ll look at other players in the AI space — OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Tech billionaires have debunked the myth that private companies produce the best products. They charge the highest prices for the lowest quality products. The solution is clear: nationalize search engines and AI. Hey, it worked for Larry Ellison / Oracle. Everyone else is just following in his footsteps. Some would point to IBM as the original innovator in this space. The rot goes way back. You can nationalize the industry, or the industry can privatize the government. As things stand, the top echelons of the tech giants see their interests largely aligned with the ideologues and bureaucrats and power-seekers in the state apparatus. A new trend is top dudes at Palantir and other companies joining the army (and immediately being promoted to Lt. Col.). It goes both ways. Privatizing will work until it doesn’t. Expect catabolic disruption in the coming year as capabilities get converted to cash leaving nonfunctional systems, not obviously reparable. Mariana Mazzucato in ‘The Entrepreneurial State” discusses the contribution of state funded, mostly university based, R&D, including blue sky research, and covers the big Pharma low risk predisposition. She uses the i-phone case study, as GPS, touch screens and other essential component technologies were all state funded. However, she doesn’t evaluate state directed research against resource consumption, so any comprehensive systems analysis. The values applied often involve military uses, such as through DARPA, but sustainability or social usefulness is more spinoff than deliberate. In the 250 years since the Industrial Revolution we don’t seem to have learned that purely profit oriented development is often damaging both to society and environment. The US definitely has an issue with short-term thinking, and that influences how the gov’t and companies interact with AI, but there’s a lot more going on. Russian President Putin said he was treating AI as on par with nukes in strategic importance. The capacity for AI-enabled weapons to transform war means those who don’t have it are severe underdogs. And while there’s a lot of “ai slop” there is a lot of genuinely impressive capability that is consistently improving, even with occasional bad updates, enshittification, short-term incentives, and so on. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. AI isn’t going away, and it will only get better (at least for the paying customers, if not for consumers of “free” services who are actually the ‘product’). Just because US companies are structurally stupid (because the owners enforce short term thinking on executives) doesn’t mean AI is not a game changer. Fundamentally, what is google? A search engine! what does a search engine do? It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly instead of sifting through industry technical standards, endless usenet forums, news website archives, or whatever data source – that’s a big shift, and clearly it’s possible even if now it’s not yet super reliable. That’s why one of Google’s top execs recently said something like “we will go bankrupt before we lose the AI race”. Their search was already degrading years ago and financially they were doing just fine. But this LLM chat-interface really could eat their lunch, and they see that. It sounds like they don’t know how to preserve their ad biz just yet, but they know they need to be at the forefront of this new tech and rebuilding their revenue streams to incorporate it, not hold on to an old model that just won’t be as competitive. There’re are a lot of reasons to be upset with Google, but their embrace of LLM-based interactions at the search page backed by their traditional search engine seems smart to me. Separate from the chat interface is LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways. That will transform search. Google would be foolish not to go head first into this and get the best people and capabilities early on. Don’t get me wrong, I think AI is a disaster for humanity and it’s already having lots of terrible impacts, as NC had documented. But I think ragging on Google for trying to jump on this new tech is not acknowledging the situation they’re in, or the likely future abilities of the tech. Google search sucks because they refused to filter out the spam, because the spam was what brought in the revenue. However: It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. At least you were honest enough to put it in quotes. If this is the direction society is going, we’re doomed. The FDA evaluating drug safety on what AI halucinates from the swamp of anti-vax drek? EPA deciding pollution rules based on the weight of anti-regulation spam out there? Building codes revised to reflect opinion pieces by developers and material vendors? Because that’s all that AI is – it’s running a popularity contest to see what the most probable ‘answer’ is for any input. That results (for now) seem reasonable is just because the spam hasn’t had a chance to overwhelm the valid, human generated content. Just wait. Completely agree. The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. I don’t use Chrome or Google search, but this makes me appreciate Brave browser’s Leo AI in search, which at least cites each website as the source(s) for each detail in its “answer,” and gives links to each cited website below that “answer,” making it easy to click through to verify. But yeah, as we all seem to agree, AI ain’t a thing to celebrate. Sorry, you are kidding yourself. AI had been caught out repeatedly fabricating sources You cannot trust its sourcing. DO NOT USE AI for research, FFS. It isn’t even OK for transcriptions, as IM Doc has reported long form. That’s not true, it’s quite possible to verify a LLM response’s veracity. At the end of your query, add a clause to give citations. I never make a query without doing this. And then I always check the links, as I would with wikipedia. Essentially I just use it to point me to the original source material. It’s been helpful a number of times. This also helps me keep tabs on how often the AI makes shit up, and when. Ha ha. And how many people know to do this? 0.00..01%? Or bother? But they’ll act on the ‘answer’ nonetheless. And what makes you think the citations aren’t hallucinations? And what makes you confident Google et al won’t conveniently change their query processing to ignore your clause, as they’ve done with boolean operators, “exact” match clauses and uncountable other changes they’ve snuck in on the sly? But you do you. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. These examples are based on pattern matching, which is something that certain AI technologies can do pretty well. Don’t confuse these with llvm applications, which try to find the the most probable series of human authored tokens in their training data to correspond to a prompt. I don’t anticipate anything good or useful coming out of llvm, partly because of its high error rate, and partly because of its tendency to corrupt future training data. LLMs have no reasoning capability. Agreed. This whole phrase is utter nonsense: “LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways” I don’t buy it. There are many kinds of reasoning. Some kinds AI is terrible at, and some it’s very impressive at. People’s definition of “reasoning” is changing dramatically, as AI is proving more and more capable. Obviously there are huge reasoning gaps, but they’re shrinking, and much of the pattern matching is simply good enough for many applications if used carefully. Look at geo-guessr. A huge amount of deductive reasoning goes into deciding on a location from clues in the picture. I also know two people who got better medical advice from chatGPT than actual doctors, for non-trivial problems, and in one person’s case it’s been a helpful ongoing consultant. Again, I’m no fanboy and mostly avoid AI and LLMs especially. And I’m very willing to ack the drawbacks and negative influences on society which are copious. But let’s acknowledge the capabilities that are there. No, your assumption is false. First, AI does not and never reasons. Saying it does is a massive category error. Second, LLMs will never never never have enough source material on which to train. So they train on other LLM generated material. That generates more errors over time. It’s a multiplying “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Narrow AI (like reading certain types of images) may perform well, but not the ones you encounter most often, the LLM. There are many articles like this if you would listen to something other than the hype: LLMs are getting dumber and we have no idea why https://www.ignorance.ai/p/llms-are-getting-dumber-and-we-have AI Hallucinations Are Getting Worse. What Can We Do About It? https://builtin.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-worsening-solutions Newer LLM models are getting worse https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardselfllm_this-is-interesting-the-newer-llm-models-activity-7330013445070741505-_6cj Google’s P/E is down to 18, so lower and more normal compared to the rest of the tech sector (Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA are all around 30-40, Meta is 25). So investors are increasingly valuing the stock based on actual revenue, not some nebulous growth potential. AI race is all about restoring the perception of these tech stock as having growth potential and pushing the P/E ratios back up without creating actual revenue. Short-term game because you can only maintain the illusion for so long, but enough to create substantial stock price growth for Pinchai and his buddies to collect their bonuses and cash out. Computer sub-literate here, so it’s a given that my opinion/analysis transacts at a very high discount, but I still have to rhetorically ask: if AI is being trained on an ever-increasing mass of Internet data, ever more of which is trash/increasingly enshittified, then isn’t it inherently entropic? We know too well the quality of it most Internet content, and I assume it exceeds the amount of pre-digital knowledge/information daily if not hourly. As humans become ever-more passive and stupefied by tech, why is AI not doomed to become the equivalent of a fiftieth-generation photocopy, or Gresham’s Law applied to information science? See, it doesn’t take an engineering degree to see the basic fallacy at play! You are entirely correct. Your intuition is correct and has already been confirmed scientifically. Not that those mega-corporations care much about it… Maybe AI will kill these corporations and their leaders if this is to be believed: https://www.newsweek.com/ai-kill-humans-avoid-shut-down-report-2088929 Yes. Essentially it is exactly what it says it is, a Probability engine based on a Large Language Model database that includes all inputs stored in that database, good or bad, scientifically valid and invalid, copyright protected or not. And now I will break for lunch… hopefully the wood glue has kept the cheese from sliding off my pizza and onto the broiler floor. Another illustration of this was the Facebook experiment (in 2017 I think) where they had two AI chatbots talk/negotiate with each other. They ended up both speaking in gibberish (which was framed as ‘inventing their own language’) before being shut down. In hindsight, it was a good example of a closed AI loop with no human input eventually becoming unstable. Both of them were operating on content completely different from their training set, resulting in unpredictable and degenerate output, which then fed back into the input and contributed further to the problem. Thank you for this post. I find much of what Ed Zitron has to say, e.g., on tech companies and their CEOs in general, fairly perceptive. He identifies the fundamental problem of scaling in gen AI (similar to that which Yves has identified for blockchain), in his post There Is No AI Revolution: Putting aside the hype and bluster, OpenAI — as with all generative AI model developers — loses money on every single prompt and output. Its products do not scale like traditional software, in that the more users it gets, the more expensive its services are to run because its models are so compute-intensive. And later, The only product that OpenAI has succeeded in scaling to the mass market is the free version of ChatGPT, which loses the company money with every prompt. This scale isn’t a result of any kind of product-market fit. It’s entirely media-driven, with reporters making “ChatGPT” synonymous with “artificial intelligence.” “still working at Google at this point” might also mean that most workers, even highly paid tech workers, are still workers that rely on a paycheck and have to make choices in life in regards to what kinds of principals you can eat and what kind you cannot eat. Oh, what a world where we could all say fock you to the American capitalist elite and just quit this exploitative system en mass. I occasionally use AI to to double check that I have covered most or all of the relevant bases of subjects I once knew well but I haven’t looked at for some stretch of time. It’s truly amazing how much BS hallucination gets injected as fact, which someone with even a rusty degree of subject matter expertise might easily catch, but think of the poor souls who used AI to breeze through their education or training, and who haven’t developed the critical eye to help them distinguish actual fact from AI fact. AI is the super-highway to Idiocracy. Excellent post and comments. For my part I did a Google search on Ahab’s gold coin because high school was long ago and I wanted a refresher. The Wikipedia article on the Moby Dick coin is pretty good, but I wanted to go a bit deeper. That led me to using ChatGPT with the following transcript: https://chatgpt.com/share/6859bdda-f50c-8004-940c-f7a995af0e2d showing it’s not just math errors you have to watch out for. I just find it remarkable that this glib AI pretends to know so much, spins unsupported theories, asserts easily discovered falsehoods, and is obsequious but not regretful when confronted. Reminds me of certain annoying people from high school. Back then people would have blamed the parents, which seems even more justified here and now. Just when you do a Google search these days you get the AI answer at the top of the results. Sometimes they give good leads but that is what the original search page did. But often it totally misunderstands the query and gives information of something completely different and is akin to asking a stranger a question who makes up an answer rather than admit that they do not know or are guessing at the answer. We have been finding that the first pages of “results” from our Google searches are now all infotainment and commercial ads disguised as “information.” Earlier years of Google search showed how good results can be provided to the questioner. This proves that the system can be designed to function for the searcher’s benefit. Today’s Google search is proof that the “service’s” core function has been deliberately degraded to rent seeking behaviour. Stay safe…information now available for a small fee from Google! Sometimes it pays to be old. I need to find a new copy to replace my long lost copy from 1976 and re-read Computer Power and Human Reason. Joseph Weizenbaum was right when I was the youngest guy in the lab and he is still right when I am the oldest guy in the lab. The noise-to-signal ratio is a lot higher now, though. YMMV but I seem to have found that presearch.com works fairly well. Almost 60 years ago, a text by Mortimer Taube has been published that anticipates much of nowadays discussions about AI: “Computers and Common Sense – the Myth of Thinking Machines”. Still holds. Interesting article, Nat, and it’s great to see these topics covered on NC. I think I disagree with some of the reasoning behind Google’s pivot to AI. It’s not wrong to say the Google search sucks and Google’s prioritization of their ad revenue has made their core product worse. This also comes at a time when Google has to share more and more of its ad market with competitors. No, I think this pivot to AI is a part of a strategic shift for Google. Cloud hosting is much harder for competitors to break into due to the amount of physical investment, and its customer base is much less fickle than ad firms. If consumer markets tank (as I’m sure they will, soon), cloud hosting will still be immensely important for most institutions, governments, and militaries. Sure, firms everywhere are planning on replacing their workers with ChatGPT, which almost definitely will not work, but many in the military are salivating over the potential AI can play in streamlining intelligence gathering, targeting, and offloading the liability of killing. Breaking into military contracting is no easy task, as the majority of this sector has been monopolised by Raytheon and the like for decades now. With Google’s cloud offerings like Project Nimbus, the Israelis are allowing the IDF to easily build and host AI systems to conduct their genocide; they have the perfect testing ground for future product offerings to both the US military and beyond. Big, billion-dollar contracts in a sector where there will only be a few competitors (Amazon, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Oracle) sound a whole lot better than trying to save a faltering product like Google search when it’d be too little, too late. I did a factual Google search yesterday, with its now automatic AI synopsis, but more in hope than expectation. This was for the full line-up of a one day rock festival I attended in London on May 7th 1972 which gig included both top British and American acts. It was a sellout, with 10,000 there. Yet, apart from one headliner, there is no accurate information – no-one seems to have documented this one-off. Most bands have their own (often obsessive) biographers with tours and gig lists. Most classic venues have their own proud historians. Details often even go as far as set lists, timings, and band members. Google AI then invented a line-up, including merging rock bands and acts who were not there but who performed at other 1972 UK rock festivals, (Reading is 50m away from London) and even adding in from tours in different years. The AI account was totally fictional, hopefully not in a deliberate Orwellian disinformation mode, but with an exceptionally high “Garbage In, Garbage Out” quotient. How harmful can AI be when it is incredible, and with such a low level of accuracy ? This level of factual precision, masquerading as being both an ‘intelligent’ and reliable response, is positively harmful, if there is any genuine expectation of believability. It was as fake as a White House briefing. I’ll suggest that there is a threshold, say the Leavitt threshold of truth, against which current and future AI is measured. The question then arises as to whether any real world decision making ought ever to be left to AI generated material, when even a simple rock concert lineup ends up as distorted as a hall of mirrors. For all I love about NC, this is one of the most insightful comment threads I’ve ever witnessed. GOOGL doesn’t want to get lapped by a new technology.

Title: Tesla shares pop 10% as Elon Musk touts ‘successful’ Robotaxi test launch in Texas
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/business/tesla-shares-pop-10-as-elon-musk-touts-successful-robotaxi-test-launch-in-texas/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T16:16:35Z
Full Content:
Tesla’s Robotaxis appeared to violate local traffic laws by exceeding the speed limit and swerving into the wrong lane – even as Elon Musk touted a “successful” launch of his long-delayed self-driving vehicles and shares popped as much as 11% Monday. In one video posted by investor Rob Maurer, a Robotaxi appeared to struggle navigating a left-turn-only lane, briefly crossing over a double yellow line before returning to the proper lane. A human motorist honked at the Robotaxi during the glitch. Meanwhile, Tesla investor and superfan Sawyer Merritt posted a video from his Robotaxi ride in which the driverless car accelerated past 30 mph speed limit during Sunday’s rollout in Austin, Texas. YouTuber Herbert Ong described a similar experience in his video, according to Bloomberg. “It’s going at 39 right now, which is perfect, right, because I don’t want to drive at 35, and it’s driving at the same flow of traffic,” Ong said in the video. “If everyone else is driving at this speed, you want to be at the same speed.” Bloomberg later reported the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking information from Tesla after seeing the online videos of issues on robotaxi after its debut. Despite the apparent hiccups, Tesla shares surged after a handpicked group of influencers who participated in the trial run uploaded positive reviews on X and other social media platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, raved about his experience after taking two approximately 15-minute rides in the state capital. “Going into it, we expected to be impressed but walking away from it, all there is to say is that this is the future,” Ives said in a note to clients. “The ride itself was completely smooth, and it was indistinguishable that the car was driverless as there was never a moment in the vehicle where we felt as if it did something irrational.” Ives maintained his “outperform” rating for Tesla’s stock and a $500 price target. The electric car maker began offering driverless rides by invitation only on Sunday, with riders charged a $4.20 flat fee — a cheeky nod to marijuana use. About 10 driverless Tesla Model Y SUVs were reportedly on the road, with company “safety monitors” on board in the front seat to oversee the trips. Bearded Tesla Guy, a social media influencer, compared the experience to “basically Uber.” Farzad Mesbahi, a former Tesla employee-turned influencer, said his rides were “very smooth and comfortable.” “Now Tesla needs to scale this service safely,” Mesbahi said on X. “As long as the system performance holds, they should be able to cover the US with Robotaxis virtually overnight.” Robotaxi is set to directly compete with Google-owned Waymo and Amazon-backed Zoox in the autonomous vehicle market. Tesla told US regulators that all of its answers to questions on the safety of its robotaxi deployment in Texas are confidential business information and should not be made public, according to a letter released Monday. On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was reviewing answers given in response to the agency’s questions about the safety of its self-driving robotaxi in poor weather among other issues. The agency said Monday that federal law “restricts NHTSA’s ability to publicly release what the companies label as confidential.” The agency added that “following an assessment of these responses and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.” On Sunday, Musk shared “super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!” “Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. Invitations circulated by Tesla said the initial Robotaxi service would be available from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM local time and limited to a geofenced area, meaning anything outside the pre-set boundaries would be off-limits. Tesla also said Robotaxi service would be limited or unavailable in the event of bad weather. Musk has long touted the potential of Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” technology, though federal regulators and other critics have repeatedly raised safety concerns. He has suggested that autonomous driving technology can add $5 trillion to $10 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization by transforming its vehicles into an instant productive fleet. The billionaire had said the Robotaxi rollout was limited because Tesla was “being super paranoid about safety.” The debut occurred at a critical time for Tesla, whose shares have been under pressure since Musk embarked on his controversial work with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and Trump had a very public falling-out earlier this month, though the two have since appeared to mend fences. With Post wires Advertisement

The US Has Bombed Iran: Cast Aside Illusions.

The bombing will continue. Obama described the bombing and sanctions strategy as “degrading” the targeted country’s ability to resist. “Bleeding” would be another word. The West’s Reckless Militarization and the New International Order By Stephen Sefton, June 23, 2025 From the perspective of the North American and European elites, the developing new world order threatens their customary political-military dominance and their subsequent neocolonial economic control based on centuries of ruthless imperialist aggression. The Consolidation of US-Israeli Hegemony Lies at the Heart of the Attack on Iran – Not Iran’s Alleged Nuclear Programme By Adeyinka Makinde, June 23, 2025 The attack by the State of Israel on Iran on Friday, June 13th, has been narrated as one that is based on the threat of the Islamic Republic of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. But a closer examination reveals the nuclear issue to be a pretext for a regime change operation designed both to secure Israel’s military domination of West Asia and to maintain U.S. global hegemony. Iran Is the Sixth Country on the List of the Countries America Is to Destroy for Israel. Dr. Paul C. Roberts By Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, June 23, 2025 Wars are everywhere, but no government acknowledges the fact by declaring war. Putin doesn’t even consider the West’s attack on Russia’s strategic forces an act of war. When we find leaders fleeing Reality, we should understand that we are in trouble. Trump Takes America to War. “Troublesome Backstory” … Without Any Declaration of War. Dr. Philip Giraldi By Philip Giraldi, June 23, 2025 Trump’s first five months in office have demonstrated that he has a deplorable disregard for the Constitution of the United States, preferring to believe that his self-declared executive authority as president overrides the constitutional prerogatives of both the judiciary and the legislature. Digital Harvest — BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street: Shareholders in the Shadows. Colin Todhunter By Colin Todhunter, June 23, 2025 They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. The US, Great Britain and France at War with Israel against Iran By Manlio Dinucci, June 23, 2025 Trump presented himself as a “mediator” between Israel and Iran. He officially reiterated that “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” He also demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender.“ Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

U.S. equities advanced at midday as oil prices declined on doubts the weekend U.S. military strikes against Iran and possible retaliation from Iran would disrupt supplies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Tesla (TSLA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 when CEO Elon Musk said the launch of the electric vehicle (EV) maker's robotaxi in Austin, Texas, was a success. Northern Trust (NTRS) shares jumped on a report the bank was approached by Bank of New York Mellon (BK), or BNY, about a possible merger. BNY shares fell. Shares of fintech firm Fiserv (FI) rose on a plan for a new stablecoin. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) dropped when the drugmaker's new experimental obesity drug wasn't as effective in reducing weight as hoped. Meantime, Novo Nordisk ended its agreement with Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) allowing it to offer Wegovy to customers, sending shares of the telehealth firm plunging. Shares of struggling silicon carbide chipmaker Wolfspeed (WOLF) cratered when the company announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it moved to restructure its debt with key lenders. Gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid. The U.S. dollar was up on the yen but lost ground to the euro and pound. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher. TradingView

Title: What The GENIUS Act Could Mean For The Digital Dollar

BySandy Peng BySandy Peng, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images) The Senate passed the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, aiming to bring stablecoins under a national regulatory framework. In this historic bill, which now needs to pass the House of Representatives, lawmakers are moving to define what a “digital dollar” really is. The stablecoin market expanded from $5 billion in 2020 to nearly $261 billion today, with Tether alone holding $155 billion. For context, Tether’s $155 billion market cap rivals the GDP of Hungary, which was about $212 billion in 2023. Last year, the company reported $13 billion in profits from investing its reserves, primarily in the U.S. Treasuries, making it more profitable than BlackRock. In fact, according to a report by the crypto exchange CEX.io, more money moved through stablecoins than Mastercard in 2024. Over $27.6 trillion was settled via tokens most mainstream credit card users still haven’t heard of, or understand, quite yet. Until now, the most rapid growth of stablecoin usage has taken place outside of North America, even though most stablecoins are pegged in some way to the dollar. In Latin America, 71% of financial services firms now use stablecoins for cross-border payments. The region processes $94.2 billion in genuine payment settlements, not trading volume. Business-to-business payments alone account for $3 billion per month. The acceleration gained momentum after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s April 2025 guidance declared that traditional 1:1 backed stablecoins aren’t securities. Within weeks, Société Générale announced USDCV, backed by Bank of New York Mellon. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands for Hong Kong's first licensed stablecoin. And all in all, one thing is clear: stablecoins have found their product market fit. Fit for emerging economies, where people don’t want to lose ~6.65% to remittances. Fit for better yield than what standard banks are providing. Fit for everyone who doesn’t want to wait for their payments to settle in three days. By the end of 2025, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of stablecoins launching. Yet they won’t take on the typical form as we commonly know it — instead, stablecoins will be getting more and more complicated. This explosion in usage is precisely what the GENIUS Act aims to address: how do you regulate a financial instrument that already moves more money than global card networks? Today’s stablecoin landscape ranges from fiat-backed tokens like USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), to algorithmic models, to complex financial instruments that generate yield or track exotic assets. In February, Figure Markets launched YLDS, the first SEC-registered yield-bearing stablecoin, offering 3.85% APY tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rate rates. MakerDAO’s new USDS accepts everything from Ethereum to tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are simple, static, and centrally issued. But the next thousand stablecoins won’t look like these stablecoins at all. They'll be yield-generating machines wrapped in “dollar clothing” — commodity plays disguised as cash or real estate exposure that fits inside your digital wallet. We’ll soon be able to use stablecoins that automatically shift between treasury bills and corporate bonds based on market conditions, or tokens that give you exposure to African farmland while maintaining a dollar peg. We’re already beginning to see certain hints: tokenized gold reserves, carbon credit backing and even stablecoin protocols that track baskets of emerging market currencies. Projects like Virtual Finance, who are building on Scroll — a blockchain that I co-founded, and Synthetix, are experimenting with synthetic dollar models. ViFi’s synthetic dollar model for example is designed to offer local currency stability in high-inflation environments, without centralized reserves. The winners won't be the most stable — they'll be the most useful. Just as you can’t currently distinguish which dollar bill is coming from Chase and which from Bank of America, soon users won’t look at who is issuing the stablecoin. Instead, the yield and what else can be done with it will matter more. Regulators are fighting yesterday’s war with tomorrow's weapons pointed backwards. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are static instruments — issued here and regulated here. But what happens when a stablecoin issued in Singapore, backed by London real estate, traded on a Cayman Islands exchange, and held by someone in Lagos, eventually fails? Whose problem is that? The answer: everyone’s and no one's. Europe tried the heavy-handed approach with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. And as a result, Europeans now access the same stablecoins through DeFi, just with extra steps and (potentially) higher risk. The U.S. wants domestic oversight while Tether laughs from the British Virgin Islands, holding more treasuries than most countries. Asia is crafting its own rules, creating a patchwork where regulatory arbitrage isn’t a bug — it’s an entire business model. When thousands of stablecoins exist, each with different mechanisms, backings and jurisdictions, traditional regulation becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Except the moles are armed with smart contracts and the hammer is made of strongly worded letters. The barbarians aren’t at the gate — they're already inside, issuing tokens and earning yield. When this unravels, and parts of it will, there's no Federal Reserve to lower rates, no U.S. Treasury to backstop losses and no coordinated response from people who can't even agree on what a stablecoin is. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe the chaos is the feature. In Argentina, chaos means 50% inflation, so a synthetic dollar backed by derivatives feels like stability that not all citizens are used to. In Nigeria, chaos means capital controls, so any dollar access beats none. For millions, these complicated, possibly fragile and definitely risky instruments solve real problems — and they solve them today. The thousand stablecoins launching this year won’t all survive. Most won't. But the ones that do will reshape how money works, who controls it and what it can do. Traditional finance took centuries to build safety nets. We’re speedrunning the same evolution in years, maybe months. Whether that ends in breakthrough or breakdown depends entirely on how thoughtfully we build today. As the GENIUS Act attempts to define what a regulated stablecoin, and by extension, a “digital dollar,” should look like, it may be racing against a moving target. The market is evolving faster than legislation can draft definitions. Disclosure: Sandy Peng is the Co-Founder of Scroll, a blockchain that ViFi is building on with regards to a stablecoin project.

[Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod says dating AI chatbots is ‘playing with fire’

The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. Today, I’m talking with Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod. Hinge is one of the biggest dating apps in the United States — it’s rivaled only by Tinder, and both are owned by the massive conglomerate Match Group, which has consolidated a huge chunk of the online dating ecosystem. A fair warning here: I’ve never actually used a dating app — the algorithm that matched my wife and me was the university housing lottery, which put us in adjacent dorm rooms in the fall of 2000. And my wife is now a divorce lawyer, so playing around with these apps seems a little bit risky. So I always end up approaching conversations about dating apps a little bit removed. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! I asked Justin what it’s like to be the married CEO of a dating app company who doesn’t use his own product anymore, especially as his own personal romantic journey is very intertwined with Hinge. The entire idea of the company and how it has evolved over the years connects to Justin’s own life and his decision to reconnect with his college girlfriend, just a month before she was supposed to marry someone else. The story is so unbelievable that it was turned into an episode of Netflix’s Modern Love. You’ll hear Justin explain how that experience connects to the company’s values, culture, and his vision of what Hinge is really for — and how all of that is geared toward helping people find lasting connections. Hinge bills itself as the app that’s “designed to be deleted,” and that, of course, is in deep tension with how mobile apps and services grow users and revenue. Then there is the AI of it all. Hinge, as part of Match Group, is using AI both internally and within its product, just as Tinder and other competitors are. There’s AI coaching features to help you improve your profile, pick better photos, and even catch an inappropriate message before it gets sent. But pull the string on all these ideas, and you get to a place where people might be talking to AI all the time, even falling in love with it, or having AI agents dating each other before meeting in person. Justin had some pretty strong feelings about the importance of centering real human connection and encouraging people to put their phones down and go out on dates in the real world. Justin also called the idea of AI companionship “playing with fire” and compares those relationships to junk food. There’s a lot more in this conversation. We got on the topic of the Trump administration and how seriously Hinge takes the privacy of its users’ data during an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights. We talked briefly about Apple and its App Store restrictions, now that companies like Epic Games and Match Group are free to send people to the web to process in-app purchases. Hinge has some plans that you’ll hear Justin get into near the end. There’s a lot going on in this one; you might even fall in love. Okay: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Justin McLeod, you’re the founder and CEO of Hinge. Welcome to Decoder. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to talk to you. I’ve got to tell you, this is one where I feel like Jane Goodall or a sociologist of some kind. I’m old. I’m married to a divorce lawyer. I can’t even download this app. It’s too risky. I’m watching through the looking glass here. I asked my younger staff for their Hinge feature requests. Don’t worry, I’ve got a million of those. Great. Excited to hear those. When TaskRabbit comes on Decoder, I’m like, “I booked a TaskRabbit.” This is very different. When was the last time you actually used Hinge as a user? Over a decade ago. Wow. Yeah. What’s that like? What’s it like trying to run this team? Is it all just data driven for you, because there’s a real element of dogfooding here. Yes, definitely. We have a lot of single people on our team at Hinge, so there’s a lot of internal dogfooding for sure, and a lot of opinions. I think that the relationship is different. So, I started the company in 2011, and I was single at the time, and I was single for the first four years of Hinge, and then, long story: I got back together with my college girlfriend, and we’ve been together for the last 10 years, married with kids and all. Did you get back together on Hinge? We were together. I tried to get her back. She said no. I started Hinge in response to that. And then someone whom I met on Hinge inspired me to go back. She was about to get married to someone else. She was living in Switzerland. I flew over a month before the wedding. She called off her wedding and moved back to New York, which led to the whole reboot of Hinge. The whole story is very interconnected. I feel like I should throw out my questions. We should just do an episode of Call Her Daddy or something like that. That sounds very complicated. Yeah, it’s been a ride. An incredible ride, and very intertwined with Hinge. But back to your question, I think that we can overweight our own personal experience a bit, especially as the CEO of the company. What I found over time is that people have a wide array of very diverse experiences, and to some extent, I think it actually helps that I’m not in there overweighting my own niche feature requests that would matter to me but not to the whole population. So the app has evolved. It’s more about helping others than it is about helping myself, which was probably the original idea of Hinge. How do you think about the connection between what the data is telling you, the data about what Gen Z daters are doing versus millennial daters, which is the cohort you started with, versus the very emotional experiences people have on this platform, which are out of your control? Eventually, you’ve got to take the meat sack to the bar and look at the other person and not fuck it up, right? Hinge can’t solve that problem, but that’s the heart of the whole enterprise. How do you connect those two in your brain? This is a very complex, nuanced industry. I think sometimes people look at their Hinge feed and they’re like, “Why doesn’t this understand my taste as well as my TikTok feed does?” People don’t quite understand that people aren’t products; they’re not infinite copies of everyone.They don’t always behave the same. Your videos on TikTok don’t have to like you back. There’s just a lot of nuance to getting this right. And you’re right. A fair amount of this comes down to the people on the platform. So what we’re trying to do is to [not only] build a great product but also an environment and a community where people are encouraged to be intentional and authentic, and attract users who are looking to find their person. So that’s definitely the art and the nuance of trying to build a dating app like ours. One of my big criticisms of social media apps right now in 2025 is they’ve all become marketing platforms in some way. At the end of the rainbow, Mr. Beast is trying to sell you an energy bar. That’s what they’re for. And smaller creators are trying to get their first-brand deals or whatever. But there’s a real organization around just marketing. And the platforms try to encourage people to create content for a whole number of reasons, but their reason for being is advertising spend, and then a lot of the content creation on the platform happens for marketing purposes. You can just see how it goes. Hinge and other dating apps are different. You’re trying to incentivize content creation. You’re trying to get people to talk about themselves, to talk to each other. The goal is to market yourself. How do you divorce that from the actual thing you’re trying to do, which is to have people fall in love and get into stable relationships? Well, it’s very much about what you’re optimizing for. And you’re right; social media is ultimately optimizing for engagement, retention, and time in app. That is the lifeblood of any of these companies. How long can they keep you sucked in? That is their objective, and so everything is built around that. And we’ve seen what the consequences of that are. They’re pretty dire. I think Hinge is almost the polar opposite of that. We’re trying to get you to spend less time on your phone and more time out in real life on dates. It’s interesting. When I started Hinge back in 2011, as venture capitalists looked at our business they asked those questions around engagement and retention. They were looking at social media, and they’re like, “What’s your daily over monthly? How much time are people spending in the app? How many sessions per day?” We were optimizing for those things, because that’s what VCs were asking about. That’s how we were raising money. Then Hinge did a pretty big pivot in 2015, when I let go of half the company and we rebooted from scratch, because we felt as if we’d really lost our way. We’d become more of a piece of entertainment that was just about getting people more matches and more activity, and getting them back every day. We’d lost sight of what we were trying to do, which was to have people come to us to find a relationship. We weren’t really optimized around that anymore. When we did that pivot in 2015, the biggest change we made was to stop focusing on the competition. We started focusing on the customer, and we made our North Star metric actual great dates. We introduced the “We Met” survey, where we asked people we suspected had gone on a date if they did in fact go on that date and whether it was good. Everything became oriented toward optimizing for that. That ended up creating a very, very different experience. That actually became the primary differentiator of Hinge. A lot of the other apps in the industry were based on engagement and retention and just getting people back; they were more like entertainment platforms. Hinge became a utility. We started growing through word of mouth, and today we’re the fastest-growing, and in fact the only growing, major dating app. We grew 40 percent last year, while other dating apps are shrinking, because we built a very sustainable business model that delivers on value. The lifeblood of our company is getting more users out on dates, so they tell their friends and then their friends come and join Hinge. The interesting thing about that business model is it’s in the tagline of the company. I always laugh when you all put out a press release, because it says, “Hinge, the app designed to be deleted,” and then a little trademark logo follows every time it’s mentioned, which is just very funny. I appreciate that you have to do it, but it just makes me laugh every time. That means you’re trying to graduate users. You’re a utility, you pay until you’re done, and then you’re out. Yeah, precisely. It means you constantly have to find new users. You basically have a different churn problem. How do you think about that life cycle? We think about it in terms of good churn. We want people turning off the app for the right reason. We don’t want people turning off the app because they gave up too early or because they don’t like Hinge. We want people turning off the app because they found someone, ideally on Hinge. What does it mean to find somebody on Hinge? Like you’re married? You’ve gone on three dates? It’s different for different people. When we did the reboot, our core market was definitely 25- to 35-year-olds, and very much people who were, I would say, looking to find their person and get off the app. Now our fastest-growing segment has been 18- to 25-year-olds, and they’re at a different phase in their lives. It was pretty interesting. When we saw that segment starting to grow, it came as almost a surprise to us. I think what attracted these younger daters wasn’t so much a focus on finding a long-term relationship, or a marriage partner today; it was very much about the authenticity and vulnerability and intimacy they found on Hinge, and a moving away from platforms that felt very gamified and flat to something that felt very human and intentional and authentic. So we think about our daters as having a journey mindset. They’re headed in a direction, they’re on a journey of self-exploration. They don’t want to waste their time on bad dates, but they aren’t necessarily looking for their marriage partner today, and that’s totally fine. We’re just looking to help people get off the app and out on great dates, and form intimate connections in real life. But there’s a difference between getting off the app and going on great dates, and then deleting the entire thing, right? Forever, yes. There’s one exit ramp that is very different from another exit ramp. Not to keep comparing it to social media, but again, I feel as if I’m just viewing this from the outside, so it’s all metaphors for me. Mark Zuckerberg is terrified that young audiences will just abandon his core app, or whatever the core social media dynamic is at the time. This is why he bought Instagram. You can read his emails over the course of these trials. He’s like, “There’s another mechanic. I need to buy it before they overtake us.” Zuckerberg keeps going down the line, whether that’s Stories or Reels or whatever the next thing is. You have the same problem, only you don’t get to keep the old users on the old mechanic. You don’t get to run Facebook and buy Instagram. How do you think about reinventing the app for that new, younger cohort that has different dynamics on the internet? We always stay in tune with where the culture’s going. I think it’s just imperative, because, you’re right, we can’t rely on only a legacy user base. So we have to stay on top of culture and where it’s going, and then continually evolve the app accordingly. Right now, a big focus is on AI, and how we can increase the effectiveness of the app in a couple of different dimensions. We’re actually finding, for example, the extent to which coaching has become really, really important right now. Especially during the pandemic, we saw social skills atrophy. People felt less comfortable meeting up with others in real life and interacting. So we’re helping people create their profiles, write their prompts, things like that. Another big thing that came out during the pandemic was more of a focus on voice, and adding voice prompts, which I think is, again, an example of our moving where the culture goes. So we’re always making these kinds of tweaks to continually keep the app fresh. Do you feel the same existential pressure? There’s this idea that some cohort of people will delete the app — the old millennials will be married or tired or whatever it is they’re going to do, and you’ve got to go get a bunch of new Gen Z users or Gen Alpha users, which is frankly terrifying. How do you think about, “Okay, we’ve got to break the old model, because it’s existential for us if we don’t capture the younger user,” or is it more of a gradation? If you look at the relatively brief history of this industry starting in the ‘90s, there’s only been one major disruption moment, which was around 2012. So you had the birth of the industry in the late ‘90s, where you had Match and eHarmony come on the scene, and then they dominated from 1996 to about 2014. It was actually a much smaller niche industry at the time. The users were older, people who felt as if they’d really struggled to find someone in real life. Then you had the mobile dating apps come on because of a few different technologies that started to come online all together — one was mobile, one was the cultural change of everyone having a social media account. Another was data-processing power and moving away from the world of searching for people to a world of a feed of relevant people, one after another. That created a pretty big paradigm shift, where suddenly technology enabled an entirely new type of experience that it was hard for the old incumbents to mirror. They tried to pivot to mobile, but they couldn’t unseat themselves from their way of thinking about the world. It resembles a very classic disruption problem. I think the next opportunity for that kind of disruption is going to be a big technology shift. We haven’t seen that up until very recently. Like with VR, AR, and other technologies like that, I just don’t see those working until they’re deeply adopted by 70 percent to 80 percent of the population, and that’s when I think it will really become something that people start using for dating. AI I think is a very different story, and it’s unclear at this point whether it becomes a disruptive force for the current players or whether it becomes more of an evolution. Obviously, Hinge has a tremendous amount of data we can use to train AI models. We’re seeing huge gains in our ability to match people up more thoughtfully given the tools, and at the same time we could introduce very new paradigms for dating. I want to talk about AI with you, but you mentioned Match, so I think this is a good time to get to the Decoder questions. You’re part of Match Group. You sold to Match Group, and now Match Group owns all of the dating apps minus one, which is a little contentious. It doesn’t own Bumble. There’s a lawsuit. We can set that aside. What’s it like being part of Match Group? When you sold your company, what was that decision like for you? Honestly, at the time we were in a tough position as a company. I’d done the reboot, and we were about a year into that reboot experience, and we had not really cracked the code yet. There were green shoots there that made me believe and made, I would say, the trained eye believe that there was really something there. But VCs just saw that we were popular, and then we tore down our business, and we restarted, and we started to rebuild again. There wasn’t a lot of juice there. So we went with a strategy of recognizing the value of what we were seeing, including massive increases in effectiveness, women coming to the platform in a much higher proportion than on other dating apps. So that was very interesting to Match. And so we received a strategic investment from the company in 2017, and that gave it a path to buy the rest of the company, which it did at the end of 2018. What’s that structure like inside of Match Group now? It’s evolving. There’s a brand-new CEO, Spencer Rascoff, who just started, and I think he’s taking a fresh look at some of that. But up until recently, and still today, the company operates pretty independently. We’re in New York. We pretty much have our own space. We have our own product teams, our own engineering teams, our own marketing teams that operate very independently. We share learnings across the platform. We use shared services like accounting and legal and things like that. But for the most part, the company has its own independent culture, its own independent mission, product road maps, marketing strategies, all of that. You said you shared some central services, like accounting and finance. Is there any product or data that you’re sharing? We certainly share learnings. Especially on things that we don’t really want to compete on, such as safety or monetization or things like that. So there’s certainly that, and there’s sharing for safety purposes. Those are the main ways we share. So if you’re a young and carefree single on Tinder, and you graduate to Hinge, you don’t get to just bring your data along for the ride? [Laughs] No. Again, I’m just looking from the outside. Tinder is interesting. The CEO of Tinder just stepped down. Your new CEO at Match, Spencer, stepped in to run Tinder for a minute. In any normal circumstance, you would be on the attack. If Tinder wasn’t part of the same company as you, this would be a moment to say, “Okay, there’s some strategic weakness over there. We’re going to go get them. We’re going to put the screws on.” Are you allowed to do that inside Match Group? So first of all, I’ll just say that we don’t really think too much about Tinder as Hinge’s competition. We think about Tinder in a very different psychographic mindset. You come to Hinge because you want to really take your time, be intentional, be thoughtful, find your person. Tinder has a much more casual, younger, “anything can happen” mentality. And so that was a very intentional portfolio strategy decision that Match made back when it acquired us. So no, we don’t think about it like that. That’s why I asked about the data and the lifecycle question. There’s a time in your life where you might use Tinder, there’s a time in your life where you might use Hinge. It seems from the overall umbrella company perspective, you want to move that user around your family of apps, but it doesn’t seem as if that’s actually happening at the top level. Yes. From the outside that would make sense. It’s a bit nuanced, because there are very different brand reputations. We like to think of Hinge pretty independently, and I think so do our users. So there’s no pop-up on Tinder that’s like, “Maybe, it’s time to cool it and download Hinge”? There’s not. [Laughs] Okay, feature request for you. What’s your org chart like? How is Hinge structured? That’s also been evolving over time, and we’re still a relatively small company. We have about 350 employees. If I think about the evolution of Hinge growing from one person to the first 100 to 150 people, originally, it was very centrally run. There was tight coordination. A lot of direction came directly from me and my executive team. Then as we started to grow beyond 100 people, I would say a lot of the technology was relatively stable. Like with social, mobile, big data, the question became, “How do we keep optimizing and iterating around this?” We became a pretty decentralized organization, where we had principles around pushing decision-making down to the lowest levels possible, keeping it really on the front lines. We had pretty independent cross-functional product teams that would work on their individual little missions or surfaces. We oscillated back and forth between that. People felt they had a lot of autonomy. That was the main ethos of the company. And then I think with AI over the last couple of years, we felt like, “Whoa, we really need to make a pretty big shift.” Like I said, the risk of disruption is high, with very big opportunities to shift the product experience in a new direction. It now requires pulling decision-making back in toward the center a bit, and giving a much clearer strategic direction to the team, so that we’re all working in concert toward one thing. Because the whole app really has to move together. Different parts of the app have to talk to each other in ways that when we weren’t going through much change, wasn’t as essential. That said, we still have very highly cross-functional product teams where product managers sit with a dedicated designer, researcher, data scientist, and tech lead to attack very mission-oriented problems. You mentioned “surfaces” and “missions.” Are those expressed as just the tabs at the bottom of the app? Is that how they’re broken down, or are they actual user journey missions? That’s what I mean — surfaces versus missions. I think we’ve gone in different directions. There’s never really a clear line of one versus the other. Do you own the Discover tab, where users just discover new people, or is your job to help people find the right person? In that case, you have to think more cohesively about operating across different surfaces or parts of the app. Now we think about our teams operating less as individual surface units and more as part of a cohesive dating-outcomes team, where people feel a bit more flexible moving around to different surfaces. How do you think about assigning product managers to those teams? Because PMs, at least in my experience, are like, “I own this square, and I will mess with this square to make this number go up as much as I can.” But “I can mess with all the squares” is really hard, right? Yes, that’s why we have strong directors at the VP level who oversee an overall mission the way that a head of dating outcomes or a head of growth, who’s coordinating a set of product managers, would. And again, we ask our PMs. Their primary identity is as a dating outcomes PM, not as a discover PM, or a profile PM, or something like that. And while day to day most of their work may focus on the profile and identity work, they see themselves as very much operating as part of this team. That feels like something you evolved to. You’re a relatively young founder. I think you founded the company right out of Harvard Business School. How has your decision-making framework evolved? How do you make decisions? That’s also hugely evolved. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned through doing it all the wrong ways first and then eventually getting to the right way. When you’re a founder and you have a small team of 10, 20, or 30 people, you’re just making decisions by the seat of your pants. What feels good? What feels right? You’re just using your own gut. As we started to get toward 100 people or so, what I noticed was I would be making different decisions on different days that weren’t always consistent. They were based on my mood that day or whatever data was in front of me or what I had last read or whatever. I was just finding I was getting pretty inconsistent. So what I started trying to do was to write down my whole management algorithm. I started putting it in a Google Doc, like “Here’s how I make decisions, here’s what I believe is true.” I started publishing that to the whole company, so everyone could just read it. We would be just very transparent about how we made decisions. It was around the time that I think I read Ray Dalio’s book Principles, and got super dialed in on how we make decisions. What are our principles, and what do we believe is true? Then I opened it up so everyone could comment on it. We would have long debates in the comment margins of a Google Doc to consider everything from our product-strategy principles to whether Hinge should have a dress code. Literally anything. It was all just there so that everyone could debate it. We had hundreds of principles, and then as the company got even bigger and we got to 300 or 400 people, it was very hard. One, you just can’t have these endless debates in Google Docs anymore. Also, the principles started to stabilize. There wasn’t as much debate and churn anymore, and then it actually became an exercise in distilling down the most essential things to communicate about our culture. I worked a couple of years ago to write an internal book called How We Do Things, which distilled it all down to four or five principles. For example, what are the most fundamental things to understand about how we make decisions here? And then individual teams and individual projects would then write their own principles that were more specific to what they were doing at any given time. One of our meta principles now is “decide with principles,” meaning that we don’t want decisions getting made based on some random person’s opinion that if tomorrow this person leaves the company and we hire someone else, they’re going to come in with a completely different set of ideas about how to do something. We really try to define our principles first, agree on those principles, and then see how our work maps to them. I’m happy to talk about what the other three principles are if you want, but that’s the framework we use to make decisions now. Yeah, talk about them a little bit. There’s a beautiful website, we’ll link to it. It has storytelling, it’s well done. But tell people what the other three principles are. So the next one is “love the problem.” What I would notice is we would get an inclination around a user problem, which maybe was not even validated 100 percent. Then we’d start getting feature ideas, and we’d get very attached to a feature, and sometimes the feature would drift and not even be solving the original problem. What I found was, if you want to build breakthrough innovative product features and products, you have to spend extra time with the problem to really understand the why behind the why behind the why of of it. You need to ask, “What’s really going on here? Can we really get deep into our users, into the data, into our users’ experiences?” You have to go to that level to get insight that just isn’t available on the surface, and then stay really committed to that problem. And that’s what, again, allows for innovation. I think for a lot of Silicon Valley, the strategy is just to throw feature ideas against a wall and see what sticks: “Let’s see if this works. Oh, it doesn’t work, throw that out, let’s try something else.” When you have a lot of deep conviction around a user problem, and you really know you want to solve it, then you have the resilience to try and try again to solve that problem, even if your first or second iteration doesn’t make it. So one of the most foundational of our principles is, “love the problem.” Fall in love with the problem, don’t fall in love with the solution, as you must be willing to give up the solution at any given time if it’s not solving the core problem that you’re trying to solve. So that is “love the problem.” Next is “keep it simple,” meaning that I think the best solutions are always the most elegant solutions. Overall, we want to keep the product very simplified and minimal. Our colors are black and white. If you look at the Hinge product today, it’s very clean, it’s very simple. We’re always stripping away features that don’t make sense and just recognizing that there’s complexity. There’s a cost to complexity every time you add a feature. So even if you add a feature, if it’s only marginally beneficial, the cost of the complexity and maintaining that feature versus the marginal benefit it adds will end up gunking up the app over time and slowing you down over time. That’s a hard conversation to have with product managers, because they’ll work for months on a feature and they’ll ship it and say, “Yeah, it didn’t harm the user base, we like it, and it even moved this metric over here by 2 percent.” And you’re like, “Well, the cost of complexity is high, and so we need to focus on things that are actually going to have a major impact.” Are you all the way two features out for every feature in? Do you think about it that way? I know some founders do. I haven’t heard that before. I don’t necessarily think that way. But I do believe in constantly reevaluating what’s in the app, asking what needs to stay, and having a high bar for building a new feature. So does it actually accomplish what we need it to accomplish, and is the complexity worth the cost? So that’s the third one now. The fourth, the last one, is “tend to trust.” I just find that trust is the lifeblood of an organization. You have to do a lot of work to proactively cultivate and tend to trust by creating strong interpersonal relationships, by creating lots of opportunities for transparency at the organization. We have always been very, very transparent about where the organization is headed. So much so that we had to make all Hinge employees Match Group insiders so they couldn’t trade Match Group stock except during trading windows, because we would be so transparent about where we were, what our financial position was. Everyone should know that all the way down to any position at the company. I think the trust that you create both interpersonally and from the leadership on down to the rest of the organization is absolutely essential. It just saves you a lot of headaches when it comes to internal politics and all those types of things. Let’s put this into practice. You obviously made a big decision to refocus on AI. How did that come about? Did you wake up one day and say, “Oh boy, it’s happening”? Was it that Match Group put out a press release with OpenAI saying, “We’re going to work together”? Did you read that and say, “I got to figure this out”? How did this come about? Certainly the release of whatever version of ChatGPT that sent shockwaves through the world was a pretty big wake-up call. Obviously, we’d already been using machine learning and things like that in the interest of safety, and in our algorithms, our recommendation algorithms. But I think the shot across the bow that came from the release of ChatGPT [with GPT-3.5] was what really woke us up to the potential capabilities here and to realizing that this could be a major disruptive force in a way that we hadn’t really seen since we started Hinge. It took a bit for us to get our strategy clear about what our thesis was on how this was going to affect matching and dating in the future. It wasn’t immediately apparent, but I think we have a pretty clear thesis now, and we’ve started to organize the company around that thesis. What’s the thesis? That there’s two main vectors that AI is going to impact: dating and matchmaking. I think the big story is AI is going to move Hinge much closer to the experience of working with a personalized matchmaking service, and away from the experience of feeling that you are joining a social platform on your own as you try to find your person. So what does that mean? Two big pieces. One is personalized matching, and the other is effective coaching. On the personalized matching front, we should be able to move much further beyond the world we are in today, which is our users speaking to us in essentially Morse code as they try to communicate to us what they like and what they don’t like. The idea is that they would be able to speak much more directly to us with “here’s what I’m looking for, here are my values, here’s my personality, here are my interests.” It means Hinge being able to listen to them and hear their preferences, and even integrate things like relationship science into the app to better understand what types of people are compatible and what types of people are not long-term compatible, and introduce them to a much more curated, higher-quality, less-quantity list of people, where they have much more trust that if you’re introducing them to this person, this is probably someone they want to go out with. We’ve already seen big gains, by the way, just by using the power of LLMs to drive more of our recommendation systems using the data we already have. But we released a new algorithm a couple of months ago that increased matches and dates by like 15 percent, and that’s just using the same data. But now we can start to use much more of that unstructured, nuanced data, with people talking to us in their own voice about who they are and what they want, which we can use very effectively. So that’s the whole personalized matching front. Then there’s the effective coaching front. A lot of our users struggle to get out on that first date, and they often don’t know why. I have friends who are incredible people, and they’ll ask me to take a look at their Hinge profile. I’m flabbergasted that this is their attempt at putting themselves out there. So we’re starting with pretty basic things. Hinge has these prompts, which are short questions designed to get you into a conversation, and you put them on your profile. A lot of people write great responses to prompts, but a lot of people write not-so-great responses, often just one-word answers that just don’t work. We found it’s just incredibly effective to have trained an AI model on good-prompt responses and give people feedback. And it’s mostly like, “Can you say more about that?” [Laughs] Don’t just put “no.” Yeah, and to be a little bit more specific and tell a little bit of the story. Good answers invite another question back, or get a conversation going. So we can give people those nudges so they write good prompts, so that they choose good photos. We have a team called Hinge Labs, which is always looking at why some people succeed, and why some people don’t on the app. Some of it is, again, simply building product features that help solve those problems, but another part of it is just giving guidance and notes about how they can be using the product better. We have traditionally published those in date reports, and we publish them in the press and we place them in the help center. But for the most part people just don’t read them. But the idea that we can take this body of knowledge we have about how to succeed on Hinge, and then look at how our users are using Hinge, and then deliver the right piece of advice at the right time to the right user, I think is going to be pretty transformative for a lot of people. There’s a pretty fine line between that and what I see lots of people already doing all day long, which is just talking to ChatGPT, just hanging out. We had Eugenia Kuyda, the CEO of Replika, on the show, and she said, essentially, “My plan is people are going to date AI bots that will coach them up into being fully formed people, then we’ll release them into the dating pool, and they will have confidence and self-assuredness.” Again, there’s a fine line between prompting someone and coaching them inside Hinge, and we’re coaching them in a different way within a more self-contained ecosystem. How do you think about that? Would you launch a full-on virtual girlfriend inside Hinge? Certainly not. I have lots of thoughts about this. I think there’s actually quite a clear line between providing a tool that helps people do something or get better at something, and the line where it becomes this thing that is trying to become your friend, trying to mimic emotions, and trying to create an emotional connection with you. That I think is really playing with fire. I think we are already in a crisis of loneliness, and a loneliness epidemic. It’s a complex issue, and it’s baked into our culture, and it goes back to before the internet. But just since 2000, over the past 20 years, the amount of time that people spend together in real life with their friends has dropped by 70 percent for young people. And it’s been almost completely displaced by the time spent staring at screens. As a result, we’ve seen massive increases in mental health issues, and people’s loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I think Mark Zuckerberg was just quoted about this, that most people don’t have enough friends. But he said we’re going to give them AI chatbots. That he believes that AI chatbots can become your friends. I think that’s honestly an extraordinarily reductive view of what a friendship is, that it’s someone there to say all the right things to you at the right moment The most rewarding parts of being in a friendship are being able to be there for someone else, to risk and be vulnerable, to share experiences with other conscious entities. So I think that while it will feel good in the moment, like junk food basically, to have an experience with someone who says all the right things and is available at the right time, it will ultimately, just like junk food, make people feel less healthy and mo re drained over time. It will displace the human relationships that people should be cultivating out in the real world. How do you compete with that? That is the other thing that is happening. It is happening. Whether it’s good or bad. Hinge is offering a harder path. So you say, “We’ve got to get people out on dates.” I honestly wonder about that, based on the younger folks I know who sometimes say, “I just don’t want to leave the house. I would rather just talk to this computer. I have too much social pressure just leaving the house in this way.” That’s what Hinge is promising to do. How do you compete with that? Do you take it head on? Are you marketing that directly? I’m starting to think very much about taking it head on. We want to continue at Hinge to champion human relationships, real human-to-human-in-real-life relationships, because I think they are an essential part of the human experience, and they’re essential to our mental health. It’s not just because I run a dating app and, obviously, it’s important that people continue to meet. It really is a deep, personal mission of mine, and I think it’s absolutely critical that someone is out there championing this. Because it’s always easier to race to the bottom of the brain stem and offer people junk products that maybe sell in the moment but leave them worse off. That’s the entire model that we’ve seen from what happened with social media. I think AI chatbots could frankly be much more dangerous in that respect. So what we can do is to become more and more effective and support people more and more, and make it as easy as possible to do the harder and riskier thing, which is to go out and form real relationships with real people. They can let you down and might not always be there for you, but it is ultimately a much more nourishing and enriching experience for people. We can also champion and raise awareness as much as we can. That’s another reason why I’m here today talking with you, because I think it’s important to put out the counter perspective, that we don’t just reflexively believe that AI chatbots can be your friend, without thinking too deeply about what that really implies and what that really means. We keep going back to junk food, but people had to start waking up to the fact that this was harmful. We had to do a lot of campaigns to educate people that drinking Coca-Cola and eating fast food was detrimental to their health over the long term. And then as people became more aware of that, a whole personal wellness industry started to grow, and now that’s a huge industry, and people spend a lot of time focusing on their diet and nutrition and mental health, and all these other things. I think similarly, social wellness needs to become a category like that. It’s thinking about not just how do I get this junk social experience of social media where I get fed outraged news and celebrity gossip and all that stuff, but how do I start building a sense of social wellness, where I can create an enriching, intimate connection with important people in my life. The connection between the wellness industry and the rise of social media is a whole other podcast, and maybe a PhD thesis, too. There’s a whole lot there to unpack. I take your point though, that maybe using our phones in healthier ways is the future. It will make us better, and that will be a reaction to the negativity we see from phones today. Literally as we speak, I’m sure Elon Musk and Donald Trump are continuing to tweet at each other in an unhealthy way for maybe the future of the entire planet. But you’ve got to use AI today. You have prompt feedback running in the app today. You’re helping people pick better photos. The flip side of that is that they might just use AI to generate the content. Can you detect it if your prompt feedback says, “Hey, that’s not a good answer,” and someone runs away to Gemini or ChatGPT and comes up with a better answer that doesn’t actually reflect them? I think about this like the extreme photo filters, which used to be popular on Instagram back in the day. Ultimately, you are going to have to go meet up with this person on a real date, and so you want to come across as best as you can, because, obviously, you’re not going to bring ChatGPT on your date with you. I’m worried about this. I want to say that I’m worried about this. So it’s not a winning strategy. That said, do people ask for advice and little tweaks? They already do it today. They ask their friends, “How should I respond to this text message?” So in some sense, I don’t see it that differently, because you will have to meet up with this person eventually and show up as the real you. Would you add that feedback inside Hinge? Hinge obviously has messaging features. Are you going to add a little coach into the messaging feature to say, “Hey, don’t be a dick”? That already exists. It’s called “Are You Sure?” That’s AI-driven to make sure people don’t send inappropriate messages. But yeah, again, the right nudge at the right time, because I think if we build the right tools within Hinge that are appropriate for dating, people will then use it and be less likely to run out to ChatGPT and use [the feedback] in ways that are probably less appropriate. Nudging people to say, “Hey, you guys have been chatting for a bit. Did you know that most people, after they exchange this many messages, usually just go on and move to a date?” Or, “Hey, it seems like the conversation has died. Here’s something interesting that you may not have noticed on their profile that you can ask about.” Little things like that, certainly. One of the interesting dynamics here is you’ll add more and more AI to the digital experience people have with each other to make them perform better or act better or be more interesting, whatever it is. And then they’ll go on a date, and then they might leave your platform. They might switch to iMessage or call each other on the phone. I don’t think Gen Z is calling each other. They’ll do something else. They’ll go on Discord. How do you bring that experience along for the ride to say, “We’re going to continue to stay here and help mediate and coach you through this relationship”? We’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do just to get people out on the first date. And at the same time, I do think there’s actually a lot of opportunity to help coach people through that experience. How to show up on a first date. What to talk about on a first date. How to build intimacy over time, how to ask about the right things to determine compatibility. So I think there are definitely opportunities for that. It’s not on the 2025 road map, but it’s certainly something I’m thinking about. Do you worry that people are going to just upload full AI avatars on Hinge and catfish each other to death? We have a very robust trust and safety team that is thinking two to three steps ahead about how to mitigate things like that. I have spent too much time talking about watermarks in AI and SynthID, and there’s lots of episodes of the show that are deep in the AI watermarks game, and it has effectively come to nothing so far. There’s just a lot of problems there. Are you able to say, “Okay, we can detect a full AI photo here”? There’s so many signals when it comes to creating a dating profile from the phone number you use and the email you use and your IP address, all those things like that, that we have a very multifaceted way of determining the authenticity of profiles. I’ll say that. Running these models is costly. There’s lots and lots of different kinds of models you can run at different costs. Are you using lots of models? Are you sending everything to GPT-4? How does this work for you? We use different models for different things. Sometimes we build them completely internally. As you said, it’s public that we have a relationship with OpenAI. So we use different things and are always balancing cost and performance against our ability to build in-house versus not. Do you see that trend shifting over time? I’m very curious about what the frontier models can do versus what the cheaper, more efficient models can do. Have you seen that shift over time as you’ve started to deploy these tools? For one, we’ve seen the cost of the frontier models just decline precipitously, which is pretty interesting to watch. But I’ll say that there are models, even the prompt feedback model, that are very, very specific and discrete, and that we can mostly build internally to understand. Do you run that in your cloud and your data center? Or are you running that on people’s phones? I don’t actually know. I think that’s in the cloud. I’m almost positive that one is in the cloud. The reason I’m asking is that to do any of this well, you need more and more data from people, and you’re asking them to generate more and more data. For instance, “That’s not a good answer; tell me more about yourself,” is more data and it’s data that you’re now storing. In particular, it’s data about gender, sexuality, and dating preferences — that’s stuff the government suddenly has a very unusual and somewhat threatening interest in. Are you worried about that? That the Trump administration or some future administration would show up and say, “Tell me all of the transgender people on your platform”? Obviously, we have very, very sensitive data that we have very, very clear protections around. And we haven’t seen anything like that. So you haven’t had any of those incoming requests yet? No. The Trump administration has also said it’s going to start scanning social media profiles for references to Palestine, and for comments about Trump himself. When you talk about matching people and values, those things come up. Has there been any request for Hinge profiles from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE or any of these other parts of the Trump administration that are doing this social media scanning? No. The reason I’m asking is the amount of data you might collect is very, very personal. It seems like a rich target. Have you thought about the planning for how big of a target this might become as you prompt people to input more and more data with AI? Certainly. I think we’ll have to handle those things as they come. We’re obviously in a very uncertain time right now, but I will say that we are primarily a platform about creating intimate one-to-one connections where people should be able to express themselves in the way they see fit, and describe themselves and their own sexuality and their own gender in the way they need to do. That will inevitably touch on people’s very private lives. I view that as absolutely sacred and fundamental to our mission, and people feeling safe to express themselves is absolutely critical. So those would be our very highest priorities, and I imagine not top priority for social media, where people are blasting posts to thousands, or millions, of people. Our platform is not about one-to-many posting and conversation. It’s about intimate one-to-one connection and one-to-one conversations. I think I would warn you that having a data pool of that kind might make you a target. I’m curious how that plays out over time, particularly in this administration. There’s some platform dynamics here as well, like iOS and Android exist. They are platforms. They’re also themselves rich targets for the government. Overall, there’s a push for the platforms to do age verification themselves. There’s laws now in certain states, and in other countries, that the Apples and the Googles of the world have pushed back against in various ways. Do you think they need to do it? Do you think that it’s at the iOS and Android level that you need to do the age verification? Because this is a core component of bringing people onto Hinge. It’s not for children. It’s certainly not. We’re 18-plus and we have our own age verification methods. But yeah, we have been pushing for these platforms to do age verification themselves because they have even more robust ways to do it. The arguments in response — when you listen to Apple and Google push back against these laws — is that it would be too hard. It would create a censorship regime, that the app vendors need to be liable for this. Have you seen any movement in that dynamic? I think at the highest level, this is one of the big dynamics of how we might regulate platforms in the future. I am staying much closer to product development and where we’re going with AI right now than I am to that. Your monetization method is obviously a premium version of Hinge. I think one tier is $55 a month. There’s another tier that’s $45 a month. The big news in the platform world is that Apple is no longer allowed to prevent alternative payment systems. Match Group, in particular, has been leading this fight. It’s in all the press releases. Has that changed the dynamics of Hinge for you? I don’t know if it changes the dynamics, but it’s certainly going to give us more flexibility in giving users options to be able to pay in different ways. I think that’s good for everybody for sure. Have you launched an alternative payment service yet? We have not. Would you like to? Yes. How soon? Certainly by the end of the year. Is that going to be a Match Group payment service or a Hinge payment service? How do you think about that? These are things that we’re figuring out, but most likely Hinge. That would return somewhere on the order of 15 percent to 30 percent depending on how the billing works for you at your scale and recurring subscriptions and all that. Is that just going to be pure margin? You’re just going to get the money back? Well, I think it changes the equation on many fronts. It allows us to invest more in the company. It changes how we would price, so no, I think it could result in lower prices. It could result in more investment in the company, or it could result in more margin. It’s probably some combination of all three of those. Match Group has been doing this fight for a long time, and you’re already describing how you might change pricing or the lifetime value of customers. Fortnite maker Epic Games fought this fight for five years. At the very end, the judge says, “I’m very mad at you, Apple. You can’t do this anymore.” Did you immediately start making plans that day or were you like, “This is going to get appealed, we have to wait”? There’s been back and forth and appeals and stays and things like that. I think just a couple of days ago, the appeal was denied. So I think that made it pretty real. Just to put the decision-making into practice, did you say that day we need an alternative payment system? Certainly the day that the original ruling came out, we started to plan. What does that planning look like? Is it, “I’m going to call Stripe”? Put us in your shoes. That happens. Someone comes to you and you say, “Okay. We need to start to plan.” Walk us through that moment. Just like anything else at Hinge, I think that we stay grounded in our principles. We look at the big picture. We look at the teams and the road maps and the things they’re focused on right now, and we think, “Does this new information change anything? And as we look at our growth team, does it make sense to build the next monetization or expansion feature? Does it make sense to pivot resources over to this thing?” And given, as you said, the 15 percent to 30 percent gain that’s on the table, it’s a pretty high priority. There’s an ecosystem of companies that might be building this stuff more centrally, that might be charging different rates. I’m excited about that. It’s wonky and boring. There’s a reason we’re ending the episode on payment systems. A whole new industry I think will emerge. Well maybe not an industry, but certainly a suite of services will emerge around this to allow people to manage subscription payments, cancellations. It’s certainly nuanced. But at the end of that, what you want is rates to come down. Where do you think the rates should be? I know no one has ever thought they should be at 15 percent or 30 percent. Where do you think they should be with a little more market competition? When you stack the credit card payment processing fees on top of the fees around customer service and all the nuance of managing those, I do think it comes down to the 5 percent to 10 percent range. When you think about recovering that up to 20 percent, are you thinking, “Okay, I can use this to lower prices and grow,” or is it that you have to build many, many more AI features to compete against the coming onslaught of AI chatbots? [Laughs] I think we’re very, very focused on innovating for the future. Like I said, it changes the equation, so it’s on all three fronts. It’s lower prices, it’s higher margin, and it’s more investment in the company. But it certainly gives us major opportunities to invest in the core product experience at a time when there’s massive disruption. So it’s a particularly critical time to be doing that. There’s a lot of talk about platform shifts. You’ve talked about platform shifts here. People might be using Hinge differently, because they have AI tools or because the AI tools are helping them find one another more efficiently, or better. A lot of the platform shift I hear about is, “Oh, we’re going to have new devices. We’re going to have new form factors. People are just going to talk to ChatGPT in the bar.” Maybe we’ll just have agents that represent us, and they’ll go on dates for a while, and come back and say, “You should go on this date with this other person we found on Hinge,” because the agents have fallen in love, and now you just have to not screw it up. That takes the screen away. That takes your surfaces and your missions and puts them in a totally different place. How are you thinking about that level of shift? Is it even on your radar? Yeah, I’m thinking about it right now. I think we overuse the form factor of our mobile devices right now for all kinds of things that it doesn’t need to be used for. I think a lot of those will be siphoned off into some other form factor. I especially think audio and voice is going to be a very big piece of it. But I don’t think that means that the form factor completely goes away. There are things that you need visual cues and references for where a screen is still going to be the dominant form factor. At least a piece of the dating equation is going to be that, for sure. Do you think we’ll get to a place where people’s agents are just dating each other and then reporting back? No, I don’t really think so. I think there are much better– Isn’t that what’s already happening in the matchmaking algorithm, in a very reductive way? Isn’t that what’s going on? I think in a very abstractive, reductive way, you could say that. But that’s not really what’s happening. We are not simulating dates. I think it’s a very expensive and inefficient way to do something that is actually much more straightforward. There’s just a part of me that says you’re going to have some competitor that attempts this, and we will all have to contend with it. I just think that’s a bit of a red herring for trying to map someone’s psyche and guess how they’re going to act. That adds a lot of complexity when actually you can just talk to people very directly about who they are and what they’re looking for and what matters to them, and compare that against someone else and what they describe, and actually make a lot of good connections and [get a] clear understanding in figuring out who should match with whom. Justin, this has been great. Tell people what’s next for Hinge. What should they be looking for? It really is the evolution of the product. I think that the shift to AI is going to be bigger than the shift to mobile for the industry. If you think about the big picture of what mobile did, it just made the process more approachable, faster, more fun, easier. But it was still the same fundamental experience of just cruising for people and trying to find someone based on very limited information, matching with them, trying to figure it out, going on a date, realizing this is not your person, trying to find the next date. We’re moving much closer to a world of really deep understanding of compatibility. Being able to zero in on the right person very quickly. It’s going to be a very transformative experience that I think is going to very much change people’s understanding and perception of the industry. So I’m really looking forward to the next couple of years, because I think that we will see more change than we’ve ever seen in the industry before. We’ll have to have you back to check in on how it’s going. Thanks so much for coming on Decoder. Great. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

Title: Defense And Energy Holdings May Help In New Climate

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A Dassault Rafale C fighter jet. Dassault Aviation is one of 23 stocks currently in my model ... More portfolio. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, with the possibility of retaliation by Iran, poses new risks for U.S. stock investors. With four defense stocks and two energy stocks in my standard portfolio, I feel reasonably well positioned. Once a year in this column, I give a snapshot of my holdings in a typical medium-risk account. My biggest concentration at present is in industrial stocks, most of which are defense stocks. U.S. relations are tense with China, Russia, South Korea and of course Iran. I own Dassault Aviation SA (DUAVF) in France; BAE Systems Plc (BAESY) in Great Britain; and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) in the United States. A quasi-defense holding is Babcock International Group Plc (BCKIY) of Great Britain. Babcock services reactors in nuclear subs, and does other nuclear work. Sterling Infrastructure Inc. (STRL) does engineering and construction, with a specialty in data centers. Its stock is up more than 800% in the past three years. My final industrial holding is Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI), which makes refrigerator coils and other plastic and metal parts. I expect the U.S. stock market to run into some trouble in the next few months, partly because of international strife and rocky federal budget negotiations. Therefore, my second-biggest concentration is in health-care stocks, because the health sector usually holds up pretty well in rough markets. I own Chemed, the largest U.S. hospice operator, and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), a large insurer and operator of medical practices. In pharmaceuticals, I own Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Sanofi SA (SNY) in France, and Novo Nordisk AS (NVO) in Denmark. I’m fairly light in technology stocks – lighter than I want to be, in fact. Most clients have about 5% of their money in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which makes chips for most major semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm and Broadcom. Also weighing in around 5% is Jabil Inc. (JBL), best known for circuit-board assembly. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is classified as a communications services stock, not a tech stock, but it has an undeniable tech flavor. It is the parent of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. I’ve long been a fan of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), so it’s not surprising that JPMorgan is in my portfolio. I also hold Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group Inc. (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan (which holds a 23% stake in Morgan Stanley). A small holding is First Trust Nasdaq ABA Community Bank Index Fund (QABA), an exchange-traded fund that holds shares in about 100 small and medium-sized banks. I also own Berkshire Hathaway, which is a conglomerate but is classified as a financial stock because of its extensive insurance holdings. This is the domain of Warren Buffett, considered by many the dean of U.S. stock pickers. Buffett has said he will step down as CEO at the end of this year. Among consumer stocks, my biggest holding is Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM), the largest U.S. egg producer. I also own Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH), a mid-sized homebuilder in a fragmented industry. Meritage concentrates on the sunbelt, where growth is faster than in the Northeast. Given my concerns about the market, the federal budget deficit, and the fraught international scene, I think it’s prudent to own some gold now. Most of my clients have about 6% of their money in SPDR Gold Share ETF (GLD), which represents a share in a large pool of physical gold. An old favorite sector of mine is energy. Diamondback Energy Inc. (FANG) is a pure play on the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. TotalEnergies SE (TTE) is the largest oil company in France, and also has significant operations in solar and wind. When I buy a stock, my desired holding period is usually three years or more. But in practice, my average holding period is about two years. Some of the stocks I recommend today will doubtless be out of my portfolio a year hence. In most columns, I include a disclaimer: Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Since today’s column is about the stocks I actually own, I will give my firm’s actual performance (on a composite of individual accounts). In the 25 ¼ years through March 31, we have achieved a cumulative return of 764%, compared to 511% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index. In the 12 months through March 31, however, we trailed the index, 5.35% to 8.25%. Disclosure: I own all 23 stocks recommended in today’s column, both personally and for clients.

Title: Digital Harvest — BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street: Shareholders in the Shadows. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2025-06-23T13:26:39Z
Full Content:
They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. Together, these three asset managers control more than $26 trillion in assets—more than the GDP of the United States and India combined. They are shareholders in nearly every major agribusiness: Bayer, Cargill, ADM, Nestlé, Deere & Co and more. They don’t compete. They co-own. And through that ownership, they govern. This is not capitalism as competition. It’s capitalism as quiet coordination. These firms don’t need to dictate policy. They shape the terrain on which policy is made. Their influence is structural, not spectacular. It’s exercised through boardrooms, shareholder resolutions and capital flows. And it’s largely invisible to the public. But its effects are everywhere. According to the Food Barons 2022 report by ETC Group, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street hold dominant stakes across the agrifood chain—from seeds and chemicals to supermarkets and logistics platforms. In many sectors, they are the top three shareholders in all the major firms. This means that ‘competition’ between companies like Bayer and Syngenta, or Nestlé and PepsiCo, is often little more than a performance. The real power sits behind the curtain. These firms don’t micromanage. They don’t need to. Their power lies in alignment—in shaping what counts as value, what counts as risk and what counts as acceptable behaviour. And increasingly, that behaviour is being framed through the lens of ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance metrics. But ESG is not a moral compass. It’s a risk framework. In recent years, BlackRock and its peers have positioned themselves as climate-conscious investors. They speak of ‘net zero’, ‘transition finance’, and ‘sustainable agriculture’. But this is not about decarbonising the food system. It’s about de-risking portfolios. The same firms that invest in fossil fuels also invest in carbon offset schemes. The same firms that back industrial agriculture also fund ‘climate-smart’ seed technologies. It’s a hedging strategy, not a transformation. And in India, this logic is taking root. Asset managers are increasingly backing land-leasing platforms, agrifintech startups and carbon credit aggregators that promise to ‘unlock value’ from farmland. But unlocking value often means locking farmers into new forms of dependency—on scoring systems, digital compliance and speculative markets they don’t control. This is not investment. It’s extraction with a sustainability label. The most dangerous shift in agriculture today is not technological—it’s financial. Land is no longer just a place to grow food. It’s an asset class. A hedge against inflation. A site for data capture and carbon speculation. In this model, the farmer is not a producer. They are a tenant on someone else’s spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet is global. BlackRock doesn’t need to own the land. It just needs to own the firm that owns the firm that leases the land. Through layers of investment vehicles, farmland is being bundled, securitised and traded—often without the knowledge of those who live on it. This is enclosure without fences. Governance without government. Asset managers like to present themselves as passive investors. They claim they don’t direct company strategy—they just follow the market. But when you own 5–10 per cent of every major firm in a sector, you are the market. And when you vote on shareholder resolutions, appoint board members and shape executive pay, you are not passive. In 2023, BlackRock and Vanguard voted against resolutions that would have required agribusinesses to disclose their impacts on deforestation and land rights. Their justification? The proposals were “too prescriptive”. But what they were really protecting was the freedom to operate without scrutiny. What makes BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street so dangerous is not that they are evil. It’s that they are structural. They don’t need to conspire. Their incentives are aligned. Their tools are abstract. And their power is exercised through absence—of regulation, of transparency, of accountability. They are not the villains of this story. They are the architecture. And that makes them harder to fight. Food sovereignty is not just about seeds or soil. It’s about power. And power today is financial. It flows through indexes, benchmarks and capital allocations. It decides which crops are grown, which firms survive, and which futures are funded. And it does so without ever touching the soil. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Steve Lightly is global co-head of Bond ETFs and investment giant BlackRock. He helps to oversee over a trillion dollars in bond ETFs. He’s got a fascinating background at both Bank America, Merrill Lynch, and since 2009 at BGI and BlackRock. I thought this conversation was really fascinating. There are a few people in the world of fixed income that understands the bond market, the ETF market, what the fed’s doing, what is driving both institutional and household investors on the fixed income side. I, I thought this conversation was absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with BlackRock’s co-head of Bond ETFs. Steve Lely. Steve Lely, welcome to Bloomberg. Steve Laipply: Thanks for having me, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: So, what a perfect time to have somebody who specializes in fixed income and bonds. We’ve had all sorts of mayhem with tariffs on, tariffs off rates, up rates down, yields starting to creep higher and higher. But before we get into what’s going on today, let’s talk a little bit about you and your background. BS degree in finance from university in Miami, MBA from Wharton Finance. Always the career plan. Steve Laipply: Not quite, so I went to Miami University in Ohio, actually. Really? I grew up in a small town in Ohio. Yeah. So went there for, ultimately ended up in the business school. I did start off thinking, you know, as many people might that, oh, what, what should I do? Should I be a doctor or a lawyer? I decided to try doctor. I love biology, organic chemistry, not so much. That’s Barry Ritholtz: That’s the gut course that screens a lot of doc future docs out. Steve Laipply: So I had a good friend who said, Hey, I’m taking finance. I really like it. Maybe give it a shot. I took a finance class, really liked it a lot. It’s sort of like math with dollar signs attached to it. So that’s sort of the way I viewed it. I really enjoyed it. And, and that was kind of, that was kind of it. I was hooked. Barry Ritholtz: University of Miami in Ohio is gonna scratch out my next question, which, which is how do you get anything done in the Florida sun in Miami? But Ohio I bet is a little easier study type of regime. Steve Laipply: A little bit. It’s still, it’s a beautiful campus, A lot of fun. But, but yeah, it’s, it was, it was a good experience. Barry Ritholtz: You come outta Wharton, we’ll talk a little bit about iShares and your previous history at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, but what was it that drew you to fixed income? Steve Laipply: I, I think a couple of things. One, I really, I really did enjoy sort of the, the variety of things in fixed income. You know, I mean, you know, equities can be complex in their own right, but fixed income, you can have so many different types of instruments and cash flows and structures. And it was just really interesting to me to see that variety Barry Ritholtz: And what do we have something like 3,500 individual equities outside of the ping sheets, and how many QIPs are there for fixed income? Millions. Steve Laipply: So I, I did this, yeah, I did this exercise on Bloomberg, depending on how you filter well, north of a million, right? Well, north and it, and it’s, you, you might even get multiples of that depending on how you filter. But yeah, fixed income as, you know, once you, once you issue that a company’s gonna issue debt, you know, perpetually, they’re gonna keep issuing new CUSIPs over time. Right. So, so it adds up. Barry Ritholtz:No, no doubt. So you’re at Bank America Merrill Lynch as a senior member of the interest rate structuring and strategic solutions sounds very institutional. Tell us a little bit about your time at Bank America Merrill Lynch. Steve Laipply: Yeah, so I, I think that group, the idea was to work with institutional clients to really help them manage risk, right? And so it was about using derivatives in particular in a sensible way to come up with hedging strategy. So my, my particular focus was on the mortgage servicing community. They, they had a very, very complex asset. They still do, it’s a little bit different now all these years later, but they had a tremendous amount of interest rate risk in those servicing right assets, right? So my job was to work with them to come up with, you know, thoughtful ways to hedge that risk. And, and there are, you know, some very, very vanilla ways to do it. But, you know, we wanted to really try to be, you know, more thoughtful and much more tailored. And that was, that was what I spent a lot of time doing. I really enjoyed it. Barry Ritholtz: When I think of hedging risk on the fixed income side, not specific to that era, which was kind of unique, I think, of interest rate, risk, credit risk, the underlying security that subsequently gets securitized. Am I warm? Tell me if Steve Laipply: That’s about right. Yeah. Barry Ritholtz: Okay. What else do you consider when you’re trying to find a way to hedge a fixed income risk? Steve Laipply: Yeah, and so you just, you just nailed almost all of it. So depending on what it is. So when you’re dealing with something like a mortgage servicing, right? That’s that lender, you know, sells the loan off, and then somebody retains that annuity that can get prepaid. So if you go pay off your mortgage, I go pay off my mortgage, that annuity disappears. There’s optionality there. You have to hedge that, right? So you have interest rate, risk, volatility, risk, things move up and down, the more likely you are to decide if rates fall to prepay. So it’s all of that good stuff. And then yes, you can have credit risk and other types of assets as well. You, Barry Ritholtz: You use one of my favorite words, optionality because every time I have a discussion with people who are not in the world of finance, and they say, have you ever calculated how much it costs to take your boat or jet ski out and figure out what each ride costs you? And I’m like, you don’t understand optionality. I have the ability to do that every single day. Whether I choose to exercise that or not, that is still a value that would cost somebody something. You join a, a boat club or a rental club or whatever, lay people don’t get optionality. Tell us how that applies in, in fixed, fixed income. Yeah, Steve Laipply: And you see this in different ways, Barry. So I mean, not dissimilar, right? So as an example, again, going back to the homeowner part, if you have a mortgage, you can decide to prepay that a lot of people don’t. Interestingly, there are stories that, that exist, and I’m sure you’ve heard ’em, where people still have 10% mortgages somewhere get 00:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Out. Is that true? 00:06:53 [Speaker Changed] There are stories about that. And so if you look at, at statistics, I haven’t done this in a while by the way. So hopefully after this long period of time, maybe they’ve paid ’em off. But you can find these very high coupon mortgages that are still out there and nobody really knows why they haven’t paid them off. But it is your right, but you’re not forced to pay it off. You would think you’d want to if interest rates were low enough. But that exists in different ways. Just like when companies issue debt, a lot of times they’ll issue callable debt. So same idea if interest rates fall or credit spreads tighten, they can call that debt and issue cheaper debt, right? And so that, that’s, that’s just sort of a basic tenant of, of how people like to structure their, their liabilities. 00:07:34 [Speaker Changed] My equity version of that is BlackRock s and p 500 fund is like five bips, four bips, it’s like practically free. And sometimes portfolios come into the office. And why are you paying a hundred basis points for what’s as effectively an s and p 500 index? Why don’t we save you 95 bips a year, compounded over 20 years? That’s a lot of money. So the market is kind of sorta almost efficient, is, I don’t know how else to describe it. 00:08:04 [Speaker Changed] No, I think that’s right. I mean, and, and over time, you know, we, we’ve really started to see investors gravitate towards this idea of efficiency. And you know, again, you, you, this is a theme that you really, really hammer home, which is, you know, basic sort of blocking and tackling is don’t surrender a lot of your return to fees. I think everybody thinks that’s incredibly important. It took a while for people to wake up to it, but I do think over time people have really started to understand fees matter, the strategy matters too. But, but fees matter as well. And so we we have to You want both? Yeah, you want both. You want both. 00:08:40 [Speaker Changed] So I know we’ll get to BlackRock starting in oh nine, but how long were you at Bank America for? 00:08:47 [Speaker Changed] From 97 through oh nine. Oh, 00:08:49 [Speaker Changed] So you quite a while watched the debacle front row. Front row. Yeah. Did you start at Merrill or did you start at Bank America? 00:08:56 [Speaker Changed] I started at Merrill. 00:08:57 [Speaker Changed] Oh, you did? Yeah. So a lot of people, slagged, was it John Thune? I thought he cut a great deal that worked out really well for Merrill employees and relatively well for Merrill shareholders at least compared to, you know, bear Stearns and Lehman and so many other companies. He, he did a solid and it took a while before people recognized it. What was your experience like going through that mayhem? 00:09:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, it was stressful as, you know, I was not involved with the particular businesses that were under stress, but it was stressful for all of us Oh, sure. As the headline scroll day after day after day, you know, was a front seat in history. Sure. As it turns out. And so I think, you know, hopefully a lot of lessons have been learned from, from, you know, that period of time, as you know, and I think you’ve said this many times, each crisis looks a little bit different. So hopefully we take lessons from the last one and that starts building a knowledge base up over time. So maybe the next time we’re a little bit better equipped to deal with it. But, but it was, yes, it was an interesting time. 00:10:02 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. To say the very least, ho hopefully we take the right lessons. Sometimes we, we draw the wrong lessons. That’s a whole nother story. So how did you find your way over to BlackRock in 2009? I’m assuming that was once the dust settled a little bit. Was it late past March oh nine? Yeah, 00:10:18 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was, it was interesting. You know, you you have sort of contact and networking with different folks and I had, and it was at the time, Barclays Global Investors. Yes. And I, I, I did know, I did know a couple of, a couple of folks that were there and we had just, you know, had casual conversations. But at one point, and this is a former mentor of mine, gentleman named Matt Tucker reached out to me and said, Hey, you know, this is an interesting opportunity. It’s called Bond ETFs. It’s, it’s a business that, that I’ve really been working hard on over here. And I’m looking for a skillset that that sort of maps to that and, and, you know, I kind of think that, that your background might be, might be interesting for this. So, you know, let’s, let’s talk about it and then, you know, sort of the rest is history. But I, I was very, very excited about it. And there is a funny story to this, which is I discovered bond ETFs on my own sort of accidentally. I was trying to buy treasuries and I was very frustrated by the commissions I was getting charged on that. A colleague actually pointed me to the iShares website and showed me that bond ETFs actually exist and you could simply buy this on exchange without actually having to buy physical bonds and, and, you know, pay a commission for it. So, 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] And, and not only was the commission, you know, next to nothing, the spread and the price discovery seemed to be a little friendlier to buyers. 00:11:42 [Speaker Changed] I was really blown away by that. And I could not stop, you know, scrolling through that website and fascinated by the idea that you could take bonds and put them on exchange. Absolutely fascinated by that and, and feeling a little stupid that I hadn’t stumbled on it before. But so, so the fun part about that was it helped a little bit in the interviews to be able to say, yes, I’m familiar and, and you know, by the way, yes, I’m, I’m actually a customer pro, albeit at a small scale, but 00:12:08 [Speaker Changed] For those people who are unfamiliar with BGI or, or Barclays Global Investments, eventually what I have argued is the single greatest acquisition in at least wealth management history. Barclays Global gets in bought up by BlackRock, and the whole iShares product line gets really super sized with just a much savvier group of product developers, marketers, traders, just everything about it went next level. How much of that were you there to witness? I’m assu. Did you start at BGI or did you start, start a BlackRock? 00:12:48 [Speaker Changed] It’s funny because people often ask me, what was BGI, like, I was there for one month before the actual, it was, yeah. So 00:12:55 [Speaker Changed] Like what I’ve heard through the grapevine is it was a solid shop with a great product. Yeah. A little sleepy kind of back water. If you are at Bank America, Merrill Lynch and you still haven’t discovered their bond ETFs. Somebody is not doing the marketing job they should have. 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, it was, it was interesting. They were very much, I think quantitative and academically oriented and, and I think, I think a little bit of the culture was okay with, with being, you know, somewhat under the radar because it was, you know, a very proprietary place. And so that, that might be, might be some of it. But yeah, BlackRock did come in and, you know, they did, that deal was interesting if, I don’t know if you remember Barry, there were, there were some discussions about whether, you know, it would be some sort of a private deal or what have you. And then BlackRock kind of came in and said, we’ll take the whole thing in that, that was announced I think in June, so I’d only been there a very short period of time. And then it closed in the fall. And I will never forget, you could tell that BlackRock was, was very efficient at this because the day after the merger closed, the signage was up on the building. You walked in all the screensavers that changed overnight. You had a nice pad notepad with the logo on it and you know, no kidding. Some nice pens and, and all that stuff. So very, very impressive how, how they were able to, to do this so cleanly and, and quickly. That’s 00:14:17 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And I failed to mention BlackRock is a little shop over on the west side of the city, 11 $12 trillion in assets somewhere in that range. How big a chunk is fixed income and fixed income ETFs at BlackRock. 00:14:32 [Speaker Changed] We, we just hit 1 trillion in fixed income ETFs. 00:14:36 [Speaker Changed] So keep outta it. You’ll get some a UM soon. Keep, keep plugging 00:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Away. Keep plugging away. Yeah. And, and you know, the industry is, is now globally, the industry is approaching 3 trillion. We’re at around 2.8 trillion in change and we think that number is gonna get to six by the end of the decade for the industry. And we, we hope to be obviously a sizable chunk of that. But it’s been, you know, it’s been experiencing double digit growth, you know, for years and years and it’s just been a very, you know, fast moving river for us. Huh. 00:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Really, really quite fascinating. So Steve, you just mentioned you think bond ETFs can reach $6 trillion by 2030. Is that right? What is the key driver of that growth that’s doubling in less than five years? 00:15:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it, and it’s a number of things and, and we’ve talked about these trends. So I think you have, you have a series of waves of adoption that happened. And it’s interesting because where we tend to see the largest uptake of bond ETFs is when you have stress markets. And so I think this is, we, we have several, several test cases at this point. So, you know, we’ve had many ones since the financial crisis. So financial crisis happened, and I think that’s the first time where I personally started getting reverse inquiry from sophisticated investors asking about the bond ETFs because they noticed that even at the worst of it, let’s call it September or October of oh eight, they were still trading on exchange very robustly. Other markets not doing so well, right? And so that got the attention of a lot of investors at that time, products were probably too small for, for a lot of those investors. 00:16:18 But they became very intrigued by them over the ensuing years. You had a, you know, you would have occasional blips in the markets, whether it was, you know, some sort of an energy dislocation in high yield or what have you. But what we noticed was every single time you would have one of these stress markets, you’d see a huge surge in volumes in bond ETF trading on exchange that would get the attention of larger investors. They would start adopting the products. Why? Because when you need to trade something, you were able to trade bond ETFs even if other things were really struggling to trade. And so every single time you’d have one of these waves of dislocation and fixed income, you started seeing more and more and more investors gravitate to bond ETFs. The big one was COVID. So for sure, February, March, 2020, you know, even treasuries, high quality investment grade, you know, the whole thing e everything was seeing dislocation, right? And so that’s when we saw probably our largest wave of adoption in, in fixed income ETFs was during that period of time, same story. You saw things that people would just take for granted suddenly struggling, you know, in terms of bid ask and depth of liquidity. But what could you trade? You could trade bond ETFs, you could trade ’em in size. That got, at that point a lot of attention because now the products have scaled to a level where even the largest investors could use them in their portfolios. And so that was interesting. 00:17:46 [Speaker Changed] So you’re absolutely preaching to the, the choir. I have heard mostly on the equity side, but also on the fixed income side. You know, these ETFs, you don’t know what the underlying is priced at. They’re filled with all sorts of stuff. It’s really hard to get a print on when it hits the fan. You’re not gonna be able to get in or out of it. You’re gonna have giant spreads and no liquidity. That wasn’t true in oh 8, 0 9. That wasn’t true during the flash crash COVI and the most recent tariff volatility, even in 22 when stocks and bonds were both down double digits for the first time in four plus decades, ETFs traded like rock stars. Why is this such persistent squabbling, you know, you’ll see just wait. Is it that people are losing business to ETFs? Why is there so much fear and concern that for 25 years have been completely unjustified? 00:18:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s a little bit of, it might be a little bit of 00:18:49 [Speaker Changed] The sour grapes 00:18:50 [Speaker Changed] A little bit, but I, I think part of it too was after the crisis, there was, it felt to me like there was this search for what’s the next thing, right? What’s the next thing that could go wrong? Not quite sure where, why that focus shifted to ETFs, but it was ETFs and probably a number of other things. But I think the idea of a bond ETF in particular drew attention because the, the talk track was, well, you’re taking something over the counter and you’re putting inside this box and you’re putting this box on exchange. And that might, you know, cause some, some interesting things to happen. And in reality what we’ve seen is just the opposite of those fears. Barry, again, just, you know, you pointed out the tariff volatility, same story, different verse, right? So you have, you know, markets are really, really stressed. 00:19:39 You see a lot of dislocations volumes on exchange. Once again, set new records. I think, you know, on the day of the announcements, I think we saw close to a hundred billion dollars of bond ETFs strain on exchange. Wow. Way more than the, the previous record during, during COVID. But the, the sort of, I think skeptic has always said, well, you know, we haven’t seen a good test yet. We haven’t seen a good test yet. I think COVID was a good test. This was just a reminder, right? And so really what happens is, you know, the exchange keeps trading even if the underlying doesn’t. And unlike, you know, the fears, you don’t see these quote unquote forced redemptions or anything like that. Nobody’s forced to redeem an ETF. It can just trade on exchange. And I think that’s the elegance of it. It gets proven time and time again. 00:20:25 [Speaker Changed] So I just wanna define some terms you reference. ’cause in the back of my head I’m always thinking, does my real estate agent mom or my art teacher wife know what that means? So when we talk about on the exchange, we’re talking about anything that’s publicly traded that you could just log onto your online trading account, buy or sell instantly. When we talk about over the counter OTC, that’s one bond desk calling another bond desk and saying, Hey, do you guys have this 2019, you know, muni, California muni series, whatever, and someone has to go locate that. So over the counter means two people literally speaking to each other to engage in a transaction. Is that, is that a fair description? 00:21:11 [Speaker Changed] That That’s exactly right. And so yes, over time bond trading’s gotten more efficient. You know, in the underlying market you have electronic trading of treasuries and now, and now credit. But you know, if you go back 20 years when ETFs were, were first new bond ETFs were first new, it was still very much a voice market. It was a very much pick up the phone exactly as you described. And even today, I think even the most sophisticated institutions still believe in the, you know, efficiency and the elegance of being able to trade a bond ETF on exchange you’re trading. If you, if you just step back for a second and think about what you’re actually doing, you’re trading hundreds or sometimes thousands of bonds simultaneously at a penny bid ask on exchange. You actually still can’t do that in the underlying market. So, you know, it doesn’t matter if you’re an individual, it doesn’t matter if you’re a large sovereign wealth fund, that’s still a very impressive feat to be able to, to do a transaction like that. 00:22:08 And bond ETFs allow you to do that. But I wanna get back to, you know, you, you had asked what are sort of the long-term drivers. I think this idea of just, okay, you can trade these things when you need to. That’s important. Another one would be when we’re building portfolios and we see this both, again on the wealth and on the institutional side, do we need to build portfolios with hundreds or thousands of bonds? Or could we take a low cost bond, ETF as sort of the core of that portfolio? Could we then use individual bonds to sort of flavor that or tilt that in different ways and then maybe add our favorite active managers on top of that. Might that be a more efficient way to do it than just going out and buying, you know, to your point, picking up the phone and calling around and putting together hundreds or, or however many bonds which might take days or weeks. And so I think there’s this growing realization that, you know what, it’s fine to trade in and out when things are volatile, but actually might be more efficient to use these things long term in a bond portfolio. So I think that’s a huge part of the adoption too, is the recognition that this might be a smarter way to build bond portfolios in general. On, 00:23:11 [Speaker Changed] On the equity side, I am fond of telling people, before you go chasing alpha, why don’t you at least lock in beta? Yeah. And I’m, I’m pleased to hear that’s a similar approach on the fixed income side. 00:23:25 [Speaker Changed] Very much, very much. And I think it’s a, and and this has been a journey because, you know, you’ve run into this, and I’ve heard you talk about this on your show before. Everybody wants to believe that, you know, if I’m buying the security, I have intent, I did my homework, it matters a great deal. And that may be true for that security. But when you do that a hundred times, some of that starts getting canceled out, right? And so that’s when you have to step back and say, all right, if I’m looking at my portfolio holistically, I want a certain beta, I want a certain tilt, I want a certain amount of yield coming from, you know, one place or another, what’s the most efficient and the cheapest way to do that? And that’s, I think people are slowly recognizing that maybe the ETF actually has that, that has that utility. 00:24:10 [Speaker Changed] So this is a good time to ask a question about active fixed income investing. It seems like it’s super challenging on the equity side. We all know the stats, 60% of active managers underperform their benchmark in year one. By the time you get to five years, it’s 80 plus 10 years, it’s 90 plus. And by the time you get to 21, it’s a handful of guys like Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch. I don’t see that uphill battle the same on the fixed income side. It seems like fixed income active does much better than fixed income equity. Is that fair? Or 00:24:53 [Speaker Changed] I think there are a few things. So, so one, we think that all investing is active to a degree, right? Okay. You’re making decisions. So if you’re using ETFs, you’re making sort of these broad beta calls and you’re deciding, you know, which beta, which sector, what have you. So there’s an active choice there in how you build that portfolio. But to your point, strictly active in fixed income, what does that mean? That means that, hey, I’m going out and I’m assembling a bond portfolio. I’m gonna compare that to a benchmark and I’m gonna see if I beat it. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] And you guys have the benchmark, the, the ISU iShares core US ag, or as everybody calls it, the ag 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, the ag. We have a GG, we have the universal, which is IUSB. One of the things that we’ve been vocal about is which benchmark are you looking at? Because sometimes you’ll see a manager buy a bunch of high yield bonds in their portfolio. Not all, but like, they’ll hold, you know, a large allocation of high yield bonds benchmark to the aggregate, which has none. And say, oh look, I’m beating the aggregate now. That’s, that’s fine. 00:25:57 [Speaker Changed] By taking on more risks, 00:25:58 [Speaker Changed] They’re taking on more risks, right? Okay, that’s fine. You may give some of that back every, call it five years. Right? What we sort of preach too is, okay, let’s get benchmarks that look a little bit closer to the risk you’re taking and see what you’re actually adding through security selection, right? So some of it’s benchmark mis specification, but fixed income markets still are less liquid, they’re more fragmented. So yes, there are opportunities there. And so, you know, people often ask me, do you believe in active or quote passive we call passive index. ’cause actually even in, in, in indexing still an active 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Choice. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. So, 00:26:32 [Speaker Changed] You know, wait, market cap waiting, that’s a choice. 00:26:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s a choice. And so my answer to that is we believe in all of the above, we think the best portfolios have elements of both of these things index and quote unquote active together, much better portfolio, much more resilient than just sort of suiciding one or the other. Oh, I’m all active or I’m all index, right? So we think both makes a lot of sense and that’s, that’s how we sort of design our product set give, given 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] The million plus QIPs, the million plus bonds that are out there. My simple thesis was always, if you want to be an active fixed income manager, how hard is it to screen out the lowest quality weakest credit, poorest, poorest yield relative to risk you have to take? And if you’re just cutting out the bottom half of that, that should do better than, than whatever the ag is gonna do or whatever your benchmark is. Because there’s, you know, hey, there’s 3,500 stocks, not all of which are great, a million bonds, there’s a lot of room for the bottom, pick a number, decile quartile, half a lot of junk can get mixed up into that. And I don’t mean high yield, I mean lower quality fixed income opportunities. 00:27:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it, this is the trick with fixed income, you could see great opportunities, but when you try to act on them, it can be really costly to actually implement and that cost or just can you find that bond, right? So right. And you locate it, the search cost, the actual transaction cost, wait, 00:28:03 [Speaker Changed] There’s a search cost for locating a bond. I always thought it was kind of built into the transaction cost. I didn’t realize, hey, find me this that’s gonna cost you just to ask that question. 00:28:13 [Speaker Changed] Well, let’s call, let’s call that the time it takes to actually get ahold of it. You’re sitting in cash, right? And, and, and I’ve, I’ve heard you say this many times, you probably should not be singing in cash very long. It, it’s a medium of exchange. Right? That’s 00:28:26 [Speaker Changed] That’s 00:28:26 [Speaker Changed] Right. But, but, but this is the, the time it takes you to locate that particular bond and then you have to pay the transaction cost, you know, the bid ask on top of it. So you know, yes, optically you could see opportunities all over the place. The question is, are you able to actually move on them and implement them at the right, at the right price? And that’s, that’s where there’s a lot of skill involved in fixed income, I think. And, and 00:28:49 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard some clients say, especially institutional clients, listen, my cash, my money allocation, I’ve got that I’ve hired you to do, you are my equity guy, you’re my fixed income, you are my opportunistic distress guy. I don’t need you to carry cash. And I wonder how that impacts people’s thoughts of when you start to see 1, 2, 3, 4% creeping up as a cash balance, gotta put that money to work. There’s an opportunity cost of just sitting in cash fair. 00:29:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and, and there is, I think what has happened the last couple years is, you know, money market assets are, you know, in the trillions. And 00:29:30 [Speaker Changed] So, well now that it’s four and a half, 5% 00:29:32 [Speaker Changed] Now that percent, now it’s four point half 5%. And so there’s been a little bit of what I would call, I think apprehension of giving up that certain or what people view as certain, you know, four and a half to 5% and then moving out. The trick to that is, you know, if you wait too long right? The market’s gonna move past you. 00:29:50 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and we’ve watched it, you know, it broke below four. Yeah, it went back over five. You’re not locking that in. You’re taking what? Look, if you’re saving for a house or something six months a year down in the road and you’re afraid of, you know, 20, 22 type year, of course a money market makes perfect sense. But if you’re looking out a couple of years, you, you want a product where you can sort of lock in a higher yield fair statement. Yeah. 00:30:16 [Speaker Changed] And you also want to be able to have, so look, cash is great. We, we launched money market ETFs. Cash plays a role in a portfolio, to your point, it shouldn’t be a huge part of the portfolio. You need to get those assets allocated, you know, on a risk basis. So whether it’s, you know, equities, safe bonds, riskier bonds, it’s like an orchestra, right? You have your string section, your horn section, they all need to play together and just sitting on the sidelines, that’s okay for a while, but it’s, it doesn’t make very good music. You need to actually have everything, you know, kind of playing its role in the portfolio. And so I long term, that is what’s going to actually, you know, build your return, 00:30:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? And I’m spitballing these numbers off the top of my head. I have to double check them. But I wanna say cash is a drag on performance four to five years in equity and nine outta 10 years in fixed income. Am I close there? Ballpark? 00:31:09 [Speaker Changed] Haven’t heard that part on fixed income, but, but I, I, I, I see your point. I mean, you know, if you just sit forever and the fed cuts rates, you’re going to miss it, right? And so that’s, that’s right. That’s, and you know, and I think the consensus right now is ah, you know, maybe they’ll cut a couple times this year, maybe a couple times next year, things can move pretty quickly on the ground. And you know, it’s one of those things where, you know, yeah, by the time you wake up and decide to move, the market may have already moved past you. I mean, to your point, we were at around four point a half percent almost a year ago. And guess where we’re sitting at today? Around four point a half percent. But it’s been quite a bumpy ride up and down. And so who knows where we’ll be in six months. So 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] The question is of if you were sitting in money markets for the past year, or you had bought some equivalent bond ETF, which performed better over the past 12 months, given all the volatility, 00:32:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, on a risk adjusted basis, you could say, all right, I had less risk in the money market and I’m sort of sitting where I was, you know, year. Yeah. But if 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] You’re in high quality bonds, how much risk is there really? 00:32:11 [Speaker Changed] If you, if you bought sort of last, if you, if you think about where we were closer to 5%, you know, you actually ended up locking in pretty good yields. Now the one thing I would say is it’s hard to time, it’s hard to time rates very, it might be actually the hardest thing to do is to time the top in yields that can be a very, very fleeting thing. So it’s more about get invested, build a durable portfolio, make sure you have risk in the right buckets. You need some high quality bonds for ballast, you need some riskier bonds for income, right? That all plays together with the equity side and the alt side of your portfolio. All these things need to come together. Yes, cash plays a role, but you will probably miss out on some very good opportunities. We haven’t had yields like this in 20 years. Right? So are you really going to try to hit the top when you’re seeing yields that have, are as good as they’ve been in a, in a generation? Yeah. So you can get greedy, right? But, 00:33:06 [Speaker Changed] Which is kind of funny ’cause it, it, oh, I always laugh when I think about someone who’s 40, 45 years old on a stock desk, on a bond desk, have not seen 7% yields Yeah. In their entire professional career. And I recall people’s bonds coming up, like the New York City geo bonds finally got called 7%. Like they were getting, I’m getting 15%, what am I gonna do with 7% their, that was when New York City was gonna collapse. You can’t get 15% today, 7% treasuries. Hey, that’s a good deal. No one realized how great a deal it was, right. 25 years ago. But that’s just, just the reality. Yeah. 00:33:47 [Speaker Changed] And then you do have to go back to the mid two thousands to see yields at these levels. So it’s a great opportunity and we, you know, rather than saying, well I really wanna hold on until 5% I, you know, I mean you, you just may miss it. So we with, we think it’s just a great, great time in fixed income. 00:34:03 [Speaker Changed] A a absolutely. And I wanna just remind everybody who thinks they can time yields or the fed collectively, everybody has been completely wrong about when the Fed was gonna start cutting, how far they were gonna cut, how often they would’ve cut. Like the consensus could not possibly have been more wrong for like, what, three years? Yeah. Four years. Here comes the recession, here comes the fed cuts, here comes if you’re waiting, ’cause you think you can guess if you’re gonna be a macro tourist, best of luck to you, 00:34:34 [Speaker Changed] Right? Yeah, exactly. It’s build the portfolio for the long term, you know, and, and you may say, well, I could have gotten a higher yield, or Hey, I locked in a pretty good yield year. Either way it’s about the next 10 years. It’s not about the next month. Huh. 00:34:49 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. So let’s start out talking about fixed income today and the obvious spike in bond market volatility we’ve seen this year. Tell us what’s going on. 00:35:02 [Speaker Changed] It’s, we’ve covered a, a couple of these things, but it’s pick your theme. Okay, so let’s, let’s go back a few years. We had COVID we had the policy response to that. We then had transitory inflation, which became not transitory inflation. We then had the, we had the reverse policy response, which was to aggressively hike rates the i the most aggressive tightening cycle in, in 40 years, right? So people were used to seeing rates, you know, bumping up against zero. I think at one point the 10 year yield was, you know, somewhere in the, you know, 60, 70 basis point range at the very, very, very lows. And I think this was quite a shock to people who were just sort of used to seeing the post-crisis, post-crisis, sorry, quantitative easing regime. All of a sudden you have yields moving, you know, to a two handle, three handle, four handle, and then ultimately a five handle something. 00:35:56 To your point, many investors haven’t seen this before. And so it was, it was quite a shock to the system then we kind of hit sort of equilibrium. The economy seems to be doing all right as we talked about, you know, people were worried about recession, it hasn’t materialized yet. The fed, you know, paused for a while, started easing, then all of a sudden you get new policy initiatives coming in, specifically tariffs, right? And so that caused a general rethinking of the way the economy is going to move going forward. Will inflation come back, won’t it? It’s just been, you know, a lot of up and downs and, and as we were talking, if you just look at the trajectory of the tenure yield, you know, we, we just sort of do this large, you know, kind of sine wave between, you know, call it sort of high threes and high fours and we’ve been doing that now for a few years. So you’re just sort of stuck in the middle of, you know, kind of a four handle, but you get these ups and downs depending on, on what the driver is. 00:36:56 [Speaker Changed] And just to put some specifics on this, when, when we look at the broad economic consensus about tariffs, they’re generally perceived as inflationary, sort of a giant vat tax on consumers. I know a lot of people in the administration push back on that characterization, but if you’re spending more money on tariffs, you have that much less money to spend on other things. Therefore it should hurt corporate revenues and perhaps be someone inflationary. Is that, is that a fair assessment? 00:37:29 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s hard to say. So I think, you know, I’ve heard both arguments. I think really what inflation is about, right? So we, whether it’s tariffs or something else, you know, people often talk about these things is well that’s a one time shock versus something that happens repeatedly over and over again. I think some of that’s academic inflation’s really. I almost think it’s a mind game or an expectations game. The real, I think question is, does inflation, you know, a higher expectation for inflation somehow get embedded or get sort of resurfaced, right? As a result of whatever policy initiative. And so I think what the Fed’s looking at is less about a specific thing and more about whether people start worrying that inflation will be at X level, like, which may be above where the Fed wants it to be. To me, I think that’s what they’re really focused on is, you know, hey, we got things down, we’re at 2.3%. 00:38:23 And by the way, what’s interesting, I actually looked at this, if you go back to, let’s call it 95 to 2005, average inflation was around two and a half, right? Not two, right? So, so if you kinda look at a long, long time series on Bloomberg as an example, right now where we’re sitting isn’t too far off where we’ve been on a long, you know, 20 odd, 30 odd year journey. But I think what the fed’s worried about is will any particular action cause people to start worrying that inflation will be higher? And as you know, sometimes that that can become sort of a self-fulfilling thing. I think that’s kind of the concern. So I’m 00:38:58 [Speaker Changed] Gonna play devil’s advocate on every point you, you said, and I want to hear your pushback, but before I get to that, former vice chairman of the Fed, Roger Ferguson, did this accidentally very funny piece about the 2% target and he could not find an academic basis for that number, but he traced it back to an interview from the Australian, their central bank chief on TV in the 1980s. And he mentioned 2% as their target. That was the first mention of it. I, I mean it certainly was a credible target in the post financial crisis while we were trying to get up to 2% inflation and deflation was the fear. But once the cares act and the new era of fiscal stimulus passed, isn’t 2% kind of the wrong target. Why doesn’t two and a half or 3% make sense in an era of fiscal, not monetary stimulus? 00:40:01 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna, I’m gonna say that is above my pay grade, but, but what I will say is if you look at a long, long time series, whether it’s two, whether it’s two and a half, I mean, I think generally right now we’re sort of in that zip code, right? So can they get it all the way down to a perfect two? I don’t know. And, and and do they want to, or you know, does, do you risk going to one and a half? I mean that’s, that’s for them to worry about. I do think that we’re not too far off. If you, if you were to look at this over many, many, many years, the worry is somehow, does everything that’s happening right now start sending you in the other direction Again, people worrying about it, does that start, you know, causing, you know, specific actions that actually lead to it to a becoming more of a reality? I think that’s what the fed’s sort of focused on. 00:40:46 [Speaker Changed] And, and I, I think transitory has become a dirty word, but i i we sometimes want stuff right now I can make the case that this bout of fiscally driven inflation was transitory. Transitory just took a little longer than everybody expected compared to the sort of deep structural inflation we saw in the 1970s. This wasn’t structural. We passed a giant, everybody stay home. Here’s $2 trillion, takes a little while for the pig to work its way through the python. Yeah, right. 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting. I mean, yeah, you had a huge, huge fiscal impulse, you know, very, very significant fiscal impulse and sure it could take time for that to work through. If you couple that with the idea that you unleashed that fiscal impulse at a time when policy was still easy, the textbooks would tell you that you probably should expect some inflation. But I think, you know, if you look at just the way people had sort of entrenched their thinking post-crisis, they were caught off guard. 00:41:47 [Speaker Changed] When, when you were at Wharton, did you have Jeremy Siegel as a professor? 00:41:51 [Speaker Changed] I did not. I did sit, I was a little bit, I was a little bit disgruntled about that. It didn’t work, didn’t work out scheduling. I did sit on in on some of his lectures just as a, as a guest. So in the back row. But yeah, 00:42:02 [Speaker Changed] I had him in here, I don’t know, two months after the first cares act was was passed and he was the first person I recall saying, Hey, this is economics 1 0 1, $2 trillion, the largest fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP since World War ii. We are gonna see a giant bout of inflation, maybe even double digits. And I, I got emails, we love Jeremy, you’ve had him on the past, but he’s crazy. We’re not gonna get anywhere near nine 10%. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. And it was kind of shocking to hear someone stocks for the long run talk about inflation and bond yields and he turned out to be pretty dead on. 00:42:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Again, if you just sort of go back and you look at a large fiscal impulse coupled with easy monetary policy that’s right out of the textbooks 00:42:54 [Speaker Changed] And, and yet it was so hard, another failure of imagination was so hard to say, no, no, we’ve had inflation 2% for 20, 25 years. What are you talking eight, nine, 10%? Yeah, it just, it just seemed that regime change was so hard to incorporate ’cause it just seemed like such a break from everything we’ve experienced before 00:43:17 [Speaker Changed] And it happened quickly 00:43:19 [Speaker Changed] Very, very, very quickly. So, so, so let’s talk a little bit about the next easing cycle. I’m assuming that six months from now, by the time we get into the fall, the worst of the tariff is behind us. Things will have stabilized at that point. Is the Fed starting to think, all right, we can unfreeze the housing market a little bit and talk, talk about a few more rate cuts this year or next? Like what sort of timing should we be thinking about? 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That’s what the market, I looked at this this morning, the market’s pricing in a couple cuts by the end of the year pricing in a couple cuts next year. And so it looks to me the market sort of settled on this idea that maybe we’ll up with a terminal rate of around, you know, three and a quarter, three and a half, somewhere in that zip code. So, we’ll, we’ll see. I mean the cut definitely got pushed out to September, right? I think originally, you know, if you go back even, you know, a few weeks ago we were still thinking sort of, you know, mid to late summer, but that’s, that’s now pushed into September for sure. So, so we’ll see. 00:44:24 [Speaker Changed] So the big question is, everybody’s been expecting cuts for so long and has been so wrong. Is there anything in the data that you look at that suggests a maybe we’re gonna get it right this time in terms of the Wall Street consensus as to when the timing of rate cuts might be? 00:44:42 [Speaker Changed] Well you j you just said it, consensus has a funny way of maybe not actually materializing, right? So I think everybody’s sort of locked in on this, on this path now it looks like just the way the curve is shaped and everything else. Well we will see I, the data has come in, you know, it depends. You, you can find, you can find people who have raised growth concerns, but then you can also find the resiliency crowd. There’s, there’s just a lot of, i I think sort of mixed data right now, but overall, you know, the economy seems to be holding in pretty well so far, 00:45:13 [Speaker Changed] Pretty resilient. You know, one of the things I always look at are spreads and they seem to be relatively low for all the people running around with their hair on fire. They are, yeah. What does that tell us of the state of the economy and, and the state of the fixed income markets? 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think if you, whether you’re looking at investment grade spreads or high yield spreads, right? The spreads to treasuries, they’re both pretty tight relative to historical, long-term historical averages. So yeah, the credit markets are telling you that so far they are buying the resiliency story. They think that, you know, balance sheets are still in pretty good shape. I mean you’ve heard this anecdote before that when yields were low, corporations did do, you know, very thoughtful issuance and they were able to lock in yields and really, you know, shore up their balance sheets and, and have these strong cash flow profiles. Now ultimately people will have to refinance and you know, that may be at higher yield. So we’ll see how long that holds. But so far spreads are telling you that the resiliency story is intact. 00:46:17 [Speaker Changed] So corporate debt issuers refinance that at lower rates. Households did it, everybody did it except Uncle Sam, we’ll save that for another time. But if you’re a buyer of debt, how should you be thinking about duration? When do you start extending your duration? Looking to lock in a little higher yield on the possibility that we see lower rates in the future? This, 00:46:42 [Speaker Changed] This is the debate capital THE, right? So I think we’ve been very much in the camp of, you know, the intermediate part of the curve is pretty attractive. So you know, if you’re looking in five 00:46:56 [Speaker Changed] To seven, see a three 00:46:56 [Speaker Changed] To seven somewhere in that zip code, you know, whether it’s in treasuries or, or high grade or even even high, high yields in that area. Anyway, that’s the maturity profile. But if you look at that versus say 30 years, I think that, you know, right now a lot of debate going on, on the fiscal situation, Moody’s action sort of resurfaced that debate. If you look at term premium meaning, and you know, again, let’s define terms the amount that investors want for holding very long-term bonds has gone up quite a lot over the last several months. And I think all of this is sort of playing into this idea that yeah, longer term yields are flirting with 5%, could they go higher? They might, there’s a lot of ambiguity around what our fiscal trajectory is. Are we at risk for further deterioration? We are running deficits with a growing economy and that is, you know, and we’re running larger ones than we historically have with a, with a growing economy. 00:47:53 So that’s what’s caused this fear of the long end. Now are longer term bonds to be avoided completely. I think there’s healthy debate on that. I do think that they still hold some shock absorber value, right? Depending on the situation. So, you know, we like we, we kind of frame this as being positioned, you know, overweight in sort of this, this belly of the curve. ’cause we think that’s a sweet spot. It doesn’t mean that you should have zero right long-term bonds, you know, it could be having some might be a good sort of, you know, insurance policy in a way. 00:48:24 [Speaker Changed] So when, when yield comes down, bond values go up and vice versa. If you’re making a bet, what’s the next 200 basis points in yield? Is it more likely to go higher or more likely to go lower? It would take a pretty big screw up to send yields up 200 basis points. Not a zero possibility, but is that kind of the core bet we’re more likely to see move down than up? 00:48:51 [Speaker Changed] I think the current view is that long-term yields could edge higher on this time edge, higher 00:48:58 [Speaker Changed] Edge, higher like 25, 50 basis points that’s 00:49:01 [Speaker Changed] Been discussed. Five ’cause this idea that depending, okay, depending on how the tax and spending bills come out and how people score that and what’s that gonna look like for the deficit, et cetera, et cetera. You know, the discussion could be, could you see further pressure on the very, very long end? The intermediate part is probably, okay, so the real debate is, are we gonna see more of a steepening depending on the outcome of, of the, you know, tax and spending bills, et cetera, et cetera. That’s been the debate. Now if you get an unexpected slowdown, you could see long-term yields come down temporarily. And so to your point, you know, do you get 200 basis points up or do you get 50 to a hundred down? It all depends on, you know, the unexpected. By definition if you get a sharp slowdown that nobody saw coming, you probably do see longer term yields coming down. And I think not a lot of people are expecting that at all. 00:49:52 [Speaker Changed] Well except everybody for the past five years predicting recessions that never showed up. The other question that I always like to ask is, hey, what happens if we yields don’t go appreciably higher or lower? Can we just be stuck in a four point a quarter to four and three quarter, you know, money market yields, plus or minus around four point a half percent. What does that look like? Can we just stay in that range for 3, 4, 5 years? 00:50:20 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Are you likely to probably not. History would tell us that except for you had this long period that doesn’t look really like anything that we’ve seen. The the 2010s. Yeah, the 2010s, right. Yeah, it’s just totally unique. So unless we go back to the 2010s, probably not, but, but I think, you know, my earlier point, it’s gonna be really hard to call, like this is the best yield that I want to get into. It’s more about we’re gonna have ups, we’re gonna have downs, we’ll have cycles. It’s really about building that portfolio out for the, for the long term and getting income. So it’s the first time in 20 odd years the income is back in fixed income. So that’s pretty compelling. 00:50:57 [Speaker Changed] So if, if someone’s fixed income investor or looking to add fixed income as a sort of shock absorber to their equity portfolios, what segments of the fixed income market do you find attractive? Where are the opportunities today? 00:51:13 [Speaker Changed] We’ve been seeing flows mostly go into very high quality. So that being treasuries, that being investment grade, that’s where, you know, the bulk of flows have been moving into. And again, much of it has been in that sort of belly of the curve type of exposure. Now, mathematically as a shock absorber, you’re gonna get your biggest kick from the very long end of the curve. We just talked about that, right? You’re taking some risk there. So 00:51:37 [Speaker Changed] ’cause if it goes the other way, if 00:51:38 [Speaker Changed] It goes the other way, it hurts, right? And so the debate’s going to be, you know, will it play that role if you get a big slowdown, right? If you get a huge risk off, will you see long, long-term yields rally like they have in the past in light of some of the fiscal concerns? That’s the big, big 00:51:54 [Speaker Changed] Debate and the dollar concerns on top of it. Yeah, 00:51:56 [Speaker Changed] That’s the debate. But, 00:51:57 [Speaker Changed] And and what about, you know, we always have clients who are looking into their retirement, you know, I just want X dollars and not worry about taxes. If you’re in a high tax state, how are you looking at the muni markets these days? 00:52:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, and I think Munis have, have really, you know, seen some whipsaw as well, right? So a lot of folks now look at, look at Munis and see some opportunities there. Again, this discussion around tax policy has really, really sort of caused a lot of volatility. At some point you just have to really make an allocation decision and if you’re, if you are, you know, in a high tax bracket, I mean Munis can be pretty compelling and they’ve cheapened up a fair amount. 00:52:40 [Speaker Changed] All right. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s jump to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests. Starting with what’s keeping you entertaining these days? What are you watching or listening to? 00:52:54 [Speaker Changed] Well, so the funny part about this is it’s so masters in business, big fan. I, we already talked about that, but no, I also, 00:53:03 [Speaker Changed] Whenever someone says that, I always feel like Rodney Dangerfield and Cady Shack keep it fair, keep it fair, keep it 00:53:08 [Speaker Changed] Fair. No, I right now, you know, streaming wise, my, my wife makes this joke. So she, and, and my, my older sons, you know, will watch Yellowstone or something like that. I’ve always got my laptop open. Right. And so she’s like, you, you, you don’t really watch TV with us. You pretend to. But I think one of the fun things I’m watching, you know, friends and neighbors right now, 00:53:30 [Speaker Changed] So Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. It’s fun. It’s funny. Are you, are you caught up? 00:53:33 [Speaker Changed] Not caught up. Not caught up. I’m 00:53:34 [Speaker Changed] Looking at, oh yeah, so the, well, whatever the last episode was five. Really fun twist. No, 00:53:40 [Speaker Changed] No spoilers. 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] No spoilers. Absolutely. But, but yeah, so on, not unexpected, but the way they execute it was really well done. Alright, cool. 00:53:49 [Speaker Changed] That’ll, that’ll, that’ll be some good binge. And I, I, I am still very fond of binge watching Law and Order. I will try purposely to hold out. ’cause I do like binge watching, really all of the above, right? So whether it’s organized crime or, or what have you. So 00:54:03 [Speaker Changed] My wife makes eight o’clock, the screens go away. You gonna watch tv, you have to put that away. So that means right before I go to bed the last couple of minutes, let me just see, 00:54:13 [Speaker Changed] We try to impose that rule. It kind of falls apart. 00:54:16 [Speaker Changed] No, no. She’s the strict stern task master. She who must be obeyed. Alright, so let’s talk about, you mentioned one of your mentors. Tell us about the folks who helped shape your career. 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and, and many of them are, are folks who’ve moved on. But I, I think there are certain people that I remember, you know, who really gave good advice and, and you know, I’ll give you a couple of examples. I had a boss, one of my first ones out of, out of, out of business school, and he basically said, look, I view my job as teaching you. I want you to listen and learn and then if you work hard, I view my other job is to help you create financial security for yourself and your family. Huh. But you have to do those things in order for that to happen. So if you listen and you work hard, I’ll try to keep up my side of it as well. And I, that always struck me and I thought that was a, a, a great way to put it. 00:55:12 You know, he viewed his job as teaching, but also if I did the right things to, to help me in the long term. And so I thought that was really interesting. Another mentor, you know, told me that you can be really good at what you do, but you really have to get along with people. You really have to be able to know where somebody else is coming from, work well with people because you can be great at what you do, but if you’re not pleasant to work with, it’s not gonna get you too far at all. And so I think that’s, that’s another lesson. I mean, you know, a lot of times you like to think you’re right in a certain debate or whatever, but you really do have to learn to bridge those gaps or it doesn’t even matter how good you are, what you do. Huh. 00:55:52 [Speaker Changed] Good, good advice for anyone listening, let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading currently? 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] Well, reading How to Think Like a Monk. 00:56:02 [Speaker Changed] Huh? I saw that go by on Amazon. This 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] Was a, yeah, no, it’s pretty cool. I had a friend of mine, I’m not sure why he recommended that book to me, and there might be a hidden message in there, but I think that’s pretty cool. 00:56:13 [Speaker Changed] Don’t read too much into 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] It. One of my, you know, I I, I like history books and so, you know, I’ve read a lot of the Ken Burn stuff. I, I think in particular, the things I’ve been fascinated with the sixties I think really helped shape the world that we’re living in the For sure. So I’ve been a junkie of a lot of that stuff. And in terms 00:56:30 [Speaker Changed] Of name some authors and books you 00:56:31 [Speaker Changed] Like, oh no, Ken, the Ken Burns stuff. I love all of his Ken Burns stuff’s. Right? Yeah. Really like that. So, but, but I’ll watch any number of documentaries. I just think that really was a pivotal time for the country and the world and kind of has echoes and, you know, really long shadows. So I always thought that was, that was really interesting. I like a book that really kind of stuck with me over the years. It was about, you know, I love math statistics, all that stuff. It was a book called Against the Gods and it was the, oh, remarkable story Risk I 00:56:59 [Speaker Changed] Love about Peter Bernstein. Yeah. Oh my god. One of my favorites. One of the all time great finance books that most people Absolutely 100% should be reading. No, no doubt about that. So I always pick out a handful of books to read over the summer. I’m so happy sitting on the beach wave, crashing in the background, banging through book after book. What just came a couple of days ago was Ron Chernow’s, mark Twain. Oh wow, okay. And you know, Chernow did Hamilton, he did a bunch of giant books. I’m super excited about that. So I’ll I’ll let you know if that’s interesting. I can’t imagine it’s not given both the author and the subject matter. Alright, our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investing or specifically fixed income and ETFs? 00:57:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think the most important thing is you have to be honest with yourself about what you like to do. And so I, I have met, I’ve met students who want, say they want to get into the markets, and you know, when you ask why that is, they have trouble articulating why. So I think part of it is you just really gotta want to do this because if it’s gonna be your life’s pursuit, you gotta wake up on good days and bad days and still wanna do it. Right? And there are good days and there are very bad days, and you still have to have that same sort of love of it. And so if you don’t love it, right, if it’s not, if you’re just saying, well, you know, I heard it’s a profitable thing, I want to, you know, I have, I have these certain personal goals, that’s, that’s not a good reason to do it. 00:58:34 But if, if you really do love the idea of markets and just this, you know, really elegant thing where somebody, you know, two people on the opposite sides of the planet can somehow find a common price. You know, what, what’s the saying? A trade is an agreement on price, a disagreement on value. I always thought that was love the coolest thing. Love. Right? So, you know, just this idea that, you know, the markets find a way. I, I think if you love that, then it’s the right career for you. But that, that’s the key thing. Find what you love and be really, really honest with yourself. And, you know, it’s fair to say, I don’t know yet. And that’s why you have to feel around a little bit, you know, whether you’re, you’re trying different things, you know, you may land on one desk and hate it, rotate to another one and love it. It’s, it’s, it’s a process, but you gotta really be honest with yourself. 00:59:19 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of fixed income ETFs and investing today you wish you knew back in the 1990s when you were first getting started? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I I’m going to admit this to you. I I know many of your, your admonishments about investing. I was, I was an original sinner on many of them. Hey, I, 00:59:42 [Speaker Changed] I, no one bigger than me. I, I, I learned the hard way. So 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] I, I did in fact do a lot of the common mistakes. You know, I I I chase things. I remember, you know, during the original internet boom, buying some really expensive racy mutual funds, which I subsequently rode into the ditch. So I think part of it is, you know, the long-term idea, you know, really, really taking like that long-term view. Now I I I did learn not to panic over the years. Right, right. And not, you know, sort of, 01:00:14 [Speaker Changed] You know, useful skillset if you run a trillion dollars, 01:00:17 [Speaker Changed] I think try to, try to, you know, keep your money, you know, don’t pay away too much of fees and definitely don’t chase the hot, hot thing. I think being diversified, you look, it may not be fun to talk about with your friends, but having a broad diversified portfolio over time, you’re gonna be fine. It’s, it’s, it’s hair raising sometimes, but you’re gonna be fine over the long term. Yeah. 01:00:37 [Speaker Changed] Very often the cocktail chatter, i i it’s not what makes you money. I love the title of Ned Davis’s first book. Do you wanna be Right or do you wanna Make Money? Right, right. And, and that really sums it up. Yep. Well, Steve, this has been really fascinating.

Title: Amazon Ramps Up Enshittification With Even More Ads On Prime Video
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/23/amazon-ramps-up-enshittification-with-even-more-ads-on-prime-video/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T12:25:00Z
Full Content:
(Mis)Uses of Technology Back in early 2024 Amazon announced that Prime Video customers (who already pay $140 per year) would be charged $3 extra every month just to avoid ads that didn’t previously exist. It was just the latest example of “enshittification” in a streaming sector all out of original ideas, desperate to provide Wall Street with impossible skyward quarterly growth — regardless of consumer annoyance or brand harm. When originally announced, Amazon promised it would try to keep the ad load to three-and-a-half minutes per hour to try and be less annoying than its competitors. But the march toward enshittification yields to no one; 18 months later and Amazon has already doubled that volume of advertisements per hour: “According to six ad buyers and documents reviewed by ADWEEK, the current ad load on Prime Video now ranges from four to six minutes per hour. And while that could bring down CPMs, buyers will be watching whether this impacts user experience.” In the modern era it’s simply not allowed for a public company to offer people an affordable product everyone really likes. The unyielding pressures for quarterly growth at any cost inevitably result in the cannibalization and enshittification of most of your favorite products. It’s obvious everywhere; but particularly in newer industries (like say, video streaming) that were disruptive just a few years earlier. Amazon has told eager investors but hasn’t bothered to communicate the latest enshittifcation to consumers yet. When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) and if it was it would be okay because Amazon is focused on “improving ad experiences”: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” As new growth in streaming customers has slowed down, giant media companies have relegated to seeking old ways to give Wall Street their sweet, sweet, improved quarterly returns. That means not just price hikes, but layoffs, pointless mergers, less money spent on content and residuals (meaning they’re too cheap to keep popular programs online), and crackdowns on things that used to be consumer benefits, like the lax treatment of things like password sharing. The short term stock boosts and tax gains from this kind of gamesmanship and consolidation disincentivizes execs from learning anything useful from the experience. By the time consumers begin a backlash and the brand begins to tank, the executives who led the charge are already off working at a different company on the basis of their “savvy deal-making prowess.” It’s purely extractive and utterly pathological. Consumer interest, employee welfare, and the long term integrity or quality of the brand or product simply have nothing to do with it. In this case, streaming companies are going to keep pushing their luck until piracy sees a massive resurgence (which is already starting to happen), at which point the executives will blame everyone and everything but themselves. Instead of any sort of self-awareness of the doom cycle they participate in, they’ll do something even more harmful: like lobbying Congress to make VPNs illegal. Filed Under: ad load, advertisements, amazon prime, competition, consumers, enshittification, streaming, tv, video Companies: amazon Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown So they’re going to stop showing ads? Hold on, they didn’t say they were gonna do that—just that they’re “committed to” doing it, whatever that means; it’s certainly not a guarantee you can collect on. And, of course, they didn’t say it would be an improvement for the viewers. Maybe they’ll “improve ad experiences” for the advertisers, but I suspect the real improvements be for their own employee-bonuses and for Jeff Bezos’s pocketbook (which may imply accidental short-term benefits to minor shareholders, too). Thank God! I sure was getting bored of watching shows without ads! Giving up Amazon Prime turned out to be much easier and painless than I expected, and that was before they started enshittifying in earnest. Amazon in general turns out to be ridiculously easy to walk away from. I highly recommend doing so. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it.

When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) […]: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” This is not a lie, just your standard marketing double-speak. It doesn’t say what Karl says it does. It never actually says ad load isn’t increasing, or won’t be increasing. Rather, it avoids the question entirely, and answers an unasked question about their “commitment” instead. Even their “commitment” is compatible with increasing the number of ads shown, as long as they’re not “simply” doing that. “Improving ad experiences” (for whom?) could include increasing the number of ads. That’s not “simply increasing the number”; it’s increasing the number, combined with doing some other stuff. People have been complaining about the enshittification of Amazon’s shopping site for about a decade now, to no avail. Apparently, counterfeit products are a big concern. I don’t shop there, but I do come across Amazon links from search engines sometimes, and it’s astounding how often (for the last year or two) I’ve seen errors about something failing on Amazon’s end, and asking me to try again. When it does work, even if the search has a brand name, the screen’s often full of other brands instead, and I have to scroll to find whatever the search was for. And most reviews aren’t without logging in now. The thing to remember about Amazon Prime is that most of its customers probably never subscribed because of the streaming. They subscribed for the free shipping, and maybe at some point started watching the video service because it was bundled. If Amazon can get them to not watch the video service, but to stay subscribed, that’s the ideal outcome. Youtube already have dominated the news about war against adblocking, copied Hulu’s pause ads on TV and mobile app, and introduced double non-skip ads. Amazon charges you AND serves you ads. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads (other than sponsors content within the video, if the content creator does that). BIG difference there. You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You’re just one person, and evidence suggests this is not a widespread view. Newspapers and magazines generally did both, plus abused people’s personal data by selling it to postal spammers. (While dead media may not be a great example, that’s not the reason it died.) You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. That’s why I’ve never had a subscription for Sky. Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. They haven’t. I had cable TV (via older relatives) in the 1980s and 1990s, and don’t recall the provider advertising except on the TV guide channel (and maybe the bills, and radio and TV stations). The main ads anyone saw were from the broadcast channels that the cable provider was being paid to relay. What were they gonna do, black those out? Eventually, cable-only networks did appear, some of which had advertising. That sucked, but, again, it was done by the channel providers, not the cable providers. A lot of people, by the way, have been telling satellite and cable TV providers to take a hike. Techdirt’s written about “cord-cutting” many times—but, at this point, I think it’s kind of done, and subscriber counts are going down more due to death than cancellation per se. (If you haven’t watched live television in a while, you may not have noticed that the ads have become targeted to old people—hearing aids, motor-reclining chairs, etc.) Fuck Hulu. – 🇨🇦 “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences Translation: “Our commitment is to ramp up our spying and data mining even more, so as to present viewers with advertisements for items, for example, that they’ve talked about in the presence of an Amazon Echo” Every thing you want to watch on it costs extra. What are you even paying for? What are you even paying for? Generally, people are buying it for the free and faster shipping. Sure, Amazon touts other benefits such as video, but it’s best for them if people don’t use any of that. Preferably not even the shipping benefits (there are ways to get them for free without Prime, and if a subscriber falls into such patterns by accident, their Prime subscription is just free revenue for Amazon). Last I checked uBlock Origin worked on Prime Video ads, but it’s been a little while since I watched Prime Video. In biology, unchecked constant growth is known as cancer. And if capitalism is not brought under control, it will go on to drive humanity right to extinction. I wouldn’t mind the commercials if they were more relevant to my interests. Yes, I know people find relevant ads to be creepy and intrusive, but my point is that Amazon already collects so much data about my shopping habits that I shouldn’t see the same drug ads that I see on regular TV. I stopped watching CBS This Morning because it became drug ads interrupted by a news segment. If I were advertisers, I’d be more picky about the data that the streaming services provide. Do people interact with the ads, such as scanning the QR code, or ignoring it? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? I don’t know what’s cheaper, but I think the bottom line is that advertising companies are able to convince their clients that, whatever it is that the ad company is doing, it’s working. I mean, their business is basically to sell people stuff they don’t need; that doesn’t just apply to the ad viewers. Or if they weren’t the same damn 2 commercials over and over again? Streaming was only ever of value when it was more convenient than piracy. That is no longer the case. It is worse. I paid for ad free, but it has suddenly gone away.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 41-year-old Srikanth Narayan, the CEO and founder of Cache, from the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity. My career began in San Francisco. I've been in Silicon Valley ever since, working at both startups and Big Tech companies. In 2021, after roughly eight years working at Uber and then Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, I decided it was the right time to take a leap and become an entrepreneur. I had built a healthy financial cushion and was ready to take a risk and create a new company. I noticed a problem around Big Tech compensation — concentration risk. I saw an opportunity to help build a solution and educate employees on this risk. Entrepreneurship has been a lot harder than working in Big Tech, but I've found it far more fulfilling. Prior to founding Cache, I spent most of my career focusing on data visualization. In 2014, Uber recruited me to lead a data visualization application suite. I stayed at Uber for six years and eventually became a staff engineer. If you work at a company like Uber for a long time, a lot of your compensation is in the form of stock, sometimes outsizing your cash compensation. As the company grows and does well, your net worth grows in line with the stock. This creates wealth for the people who hold that stock, but having way too much of your net worth in a few stocks means you're taking undue risk. Take Tesla. In recent months, some people who worked at Tesla may have seen their net worth fluctuate due to the changing value of the company's stock. People tend to hold on to these massive stock positions due to inertia and because the taxes for reallocating stock can be very expensive. I joined Uber at a good time. The company mostly did well and went public in 2019. All of the wealth I had accumulated in stock became real money on the open market that I could sell or trade. However, I had a lot of low-basis stocks that would trigger a high capital gains bill if I sold them. When I joined Waymo in 2020, my Alphabet colleagues talked about similar problems. I found this issue unsettling. A steep drop in stock price at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic affected my portfolio. I hired a wealth manager to help me find solutions for concentration risk. They showed me products that help people of high net worth manage concentration risk. One option is depositing concentrated stock into an exchange fund where others have done the same, and receiving fund units in return. This method can diversify your portfolio while deferring capital gains taxes. It sounded like a great product, but none of my peers had heard of it. It seemed to only be available at private banks, and only for people of a certain net worth. From what I saw, the exchange funds required a lot of human operational coordination. There seemed to be little innovation in this area to improve efficiency. I saw a massive business opportunity. I wanted to make products like this more efficient and available more broadly. I resigned from Waymo in late 2021 to start my business, Cache, which I formally launched in March 2024. We're a specialized brokerage for people holding large stock positions. Our flagship product is an exchange fund that helps people diversify their portfolios. My experience at Uber gave me an understanding of how to turn an idea into a full-blown vision as a founder. I designed products at Uber that became widely adopted within the company. This took engineering work and entrepreneurial spirit. However, moving from corporate life to building a company myself involved a lot of learning on the job. There wasn't really a manual I could follow for building an exchange fund, so we had to do a lot of R&D. There were many steps involved, including working with the SEC and FINRA to get the right registrations, since the industry is highly regulated, and building the technical infrastructure for a brokerage system. I was one of the first users of my own product, and I invested a lot of my Uber stock in our exchange funds. Running a startup is very different from working at a Big Tech company. I'm probably working triple the time I was before. Being employed in Big Tech was a very comfortable life. You worked on challenging problems and got paid well to do it. While I enjoyed this, I also wanted to figure out my own path. The entrepreneurial journey has been more fulfilling. I've had to go through personal trials, such as not paying myself for the first year after leaving Waymo. Because of my financial cushion from working in Silicon Valley, the stress of this didn't really bear on me. I'd made sure I had several years of living expenses in reserve before taking the leap. Becoming an entrepreneur requires drive and conviction. It's a very hard journey, and often, market forces will be against you until they start working with you. The glamour of being a startup founder or of an exit is the wrong reason for forming a company. It should be about self-fulfillment and a passion for building something from scratch and making a change in the world. Do you have a story to share about leaving Big Tech?

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement These go-to Alexa commands save time, simplify tasks, and make daily life easier. If you have the latest Echo Dot with Clock, you can start using these voice commands today. Alexa has come a long way since its early days as a basic voice assistant. What once felt like a novelty for playing music or checking the weather is now a powerful tool for managing your entire home. With the launch of Alexa Plus and its new AI-powered features, Amazon's voice assistant is smarter and more capable than ever before. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a must-have tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now is the perfect time to see how much more useful it has become. with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: Move over, Magnificent 7: Goldman Sachs proposes the ‘Prom 10,’ China’s top stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and BYD

Cecilia Hult is an editorial intern based in Hong Kong. Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S. It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%. Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI. But what about China? Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services. Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years. The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy. The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC. E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies. Meituan, China’s food delivery giant, is another Prom 10 stock. The company holds a 70% market share in the delivery space, and is expanding to new markets like Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Yet the stock has taken a beating in recent weeks due to fierce competition from JD.com, another e-commerce giant. BYD, the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, and Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone brand that’s recently expanded to cars, also hold spots in Goldman Sachs’ “Prom 10.” Chinese EVs are quickly winning over customers both in China and overseas, due to the affordable price points and appealing designs. That’s helped boost the shares of both companies: BYD and Xiaomi are up by around 45% and 60% respectively. Midea Group is one of China’s leading manufacturers of home appliances and another Prom 10 stock. The company debuted on Hong Kong’s stock exchange last year, raising almost $4 billion. Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, and Midea are all on Fortune’s Global 500, which ranks the world’s largest companies by revenue. Rounding out the Prom 10 are NetEase Games, the second-highest grossing gaming company in China; Hengrui, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer; Trip.com, a travel booking platform; and ANTA, the world’s third-largest sportswear company, behind Nike and Adidas. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here’s What A Top Trader Just Said

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. With Bitcoin precariously recovering above the $100,000 mark and altcoins bleeding momentum, traders are asking the obvious: Is the crypto bull run over? According to systematic trader Adam Bakay (@abetrade), the answer is not so clear-cut. In a detailed market breakdown posted June 22, Bakay offered a technically grounded, cautiously defensive assessment—one that acknowledges geopolitical risks but stays rooted in positioning and price structure. “Looking at the monthly and weekly timeframes, we are still technically in an uptrend,” Bakay wrote, noting that “no key swing low was broken, and the 365-day rolling VWAP has been respected during the pullback in April.” Despite this, he admits that “the failure to make new all-time highs similar to the top in 2021” is a concern—especially given the accumulation by players like BlackRock, which now holds around 3.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. It’s that divergence—between strong institutional interest and a market struggling to break higher—that has made Bakay more cautious in recent weeks. “This is why I have been very defensive and kept most of my trades short-term,” he said. His trading view focuses on two potential technical scenarios: either a reclaim of the $100,000 support area—“likely if the conflict in the Middle East does not further escalate”—or a dip into the $97,000–$95,000 range, where strong technical support resides in the form of the 200-day moving average, local price structure, and the 90-day rolling VWAP. Still, Bakay made it clear he’s not shorting the market. “I am not currently considering any short trades due to my current positioning,” he emphasized, adding that open interest is dropping and that we are starting to see the “first signs of clear spot bid interest since the April lows.” The options market, meanwhile, is flashing early caution: the 25-delta risk reversal skew sits around -5, not yet at panic levels, but trending more negative. On Ethereum, Bakay was notably blunt. “ETH almost had its moment, but of course had to become a disappointment,” he said. He attributes the failed breakout in part to how quickly the “DeFi Summer 2025” narrative went viral. “People are getting too horny, and market made sure to punish them,” he noted, referencing his own tweet from a few days earlier. The technical picture on ETH doesn’t inspire confidence either. “During significant market moves, like we had at the beginning of May, the last thing you want to see is price retracing throughout that area,” he explained, saying the next meaningful support lies near $1,800. On the daily chart, Ethereum is sitting right at a confluence of support—both the 90-day rolling VWAP and what he calls a “pivotal level.” Still, much like Bitcoin, Bakay sees Ethereum’s short-term fate as largely dependent on developments in the Middle East. On positioning, ETH also shows signs of an oversold environment, though Bakay believes high volatility in ETH options has caused traders to use spreads instead of outright directional bets. “Positioning is now very clearly pointing towards the possible upside reversal in both perpetual and spot,” he said. Altcoins received no reprieve. “Altcoins have not been having fun for quite a while,” Bakay wrote, pointing out that “every time it starts to look better, it will almost immediately get worse.” He notes that the expected rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins hasn’t materialized, and the real rotation now seems to be into crypto-related equities, which better reflect the ETF-driven macro trade. Even strong names like Solana are fading. “SOL has almost retraced the entire rally from April,” he warned. The key level to watch is $100. “There is not much of a technical support sub-$100,” and if “shit hits the fan,” Bakay would look to bid around that round number. Bakay also briefly touched on two newer altcoins—Hype and Fartcoin—saying one offers a solid product and the other draws interest through volatility and liquidity. “Fartcoin would become attractive if it could reclaim the $1 or $0.50 area. Hype could find a bounce sub-$30.” His closing thoughts were pragmatic: “We are not in easy market conditions, with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and markets can be significantly affected by a single news release.” While he believes the market may be “getting too short at the moment,” he remains highly conscious of the possibility that a multi-month correction is already in play. “I don’t think there is a need to be a hero and try to catch a falling knife,” he concluded. “I would much rather wait for some positive news and signs of lower timeframe reversals.” In essence, Bakay doesn’t call the top. But his post makes one thing clear: this is not a market for bravado. It’s a time for restraint, tight risk management, and respect for volatility—especially when the bullish case no longer has momentum on its side. At press time, BTC traded at $101,847.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman, The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist (1998) Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer calling for a repeal of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which provided hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to unreliable wind and solar. TWTW continues with the significant omissions in proclamations by NOAA and other organizations in claiming increasing carbon dioxide is acidifying the oceans. TWTW discusses assertions by organizations and individuals that climate misinformation should be criminalized, ignoring the fact that such organizations and individuals rely on information that fails to meet the standards of the scientific method. TWTW questions what is meant by an existential threat, then concludes with a presentation of part of the program of the upcoming DDP conference and where to register to attend in person or by Zoom. ********************* Repeal IRA Subsidies: Last week, TWTW focused on a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer emphasizing Gold Standard Science. “Scientific Knowledge Is Determined by the Scientific Method, Not by Government Opinion, Consensus, 97% of Scientists’ Opinions, Peer Review, Models that Do Not Work, or Cherry-Picked, Fabricated, Falsified or Omitted Contradictory Data.” This week, the CO2 Coalition published a paper by the same two authors titled “IRA Climate Subsidies Should Be Repealed.” The authors state: “Physics demonstrates that the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) trillion-dollar climate subsidies rest on false science. The real science, which is virtually never reported, is that the IRA subsidies of $4.7 trillion (Cato’s estimate to 2050) aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have no climate benefit, for two separate and cumulative reasons: First, the physics of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases shows that reducing them to net zero will have a negligible effect on temperatures and extreme weather. At present, there are no effective replacements for fossil fuels, and eliminating them will be disastrous for people worldwide. The scientific fact is that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the world’s food supply by about 40%, with a trivial effect on Earth’s climate. Second, the theory that GHG emissions are the primary driver of climate change is based on false science, such as consensus, theoretical models that do not work, fabricated and falsified data, agenda-driven peer review and government opinions. None of this is real science. (See our June 7, 2025, paper for details, Physics Demonstrates That Increasing Greenhouse Gases Cannot Cause Dangerous Warming, Extreme Weather or Any Harm.) In summary, IRA subsidies will waste trillions of dollars for no climate benefit, reducing carbon dioxide emissions will reduce the amount of food worldwide, eliminating fossil fuels will be disastrous for people worldwide, and the trillions of dollars would be better spent improving Americans’ standard of living. Accordingly, all the IRA climate subsidies should be repealed ASAP.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Another Significant Omission: The false Endangerment Finding by the EPA under Lisa Jackson in 2009 under the Obama Administration asserts: “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and to endanger the public welfare of current and future generations.” The finding ignores or omits contradictory evidence including the only comprehensive global temperature data existing, the estimates of temperature from satellite evidence calculated since 1979 by Roy Spencer and John Christy and published monthly by the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Similar calculations by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) independently verify their results. In 1998. Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS discovered that UAH failed to correctly compensate for orbital drift. When the error was discovered and verified, Spencer and Christy quickly made appropriate adjustments, in keeping with the scientific method. Errors need to be exposed, verified, and corrected. Ignoring them or omitting them is contrary to the scientific method. For years, NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research has funded the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), a climate modeling laboratory at Princeton. NOAA also funds the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), which is a collaboration between GFDL and Princeton University. For over forty years, GFDL and CIMES have ignored UAH data and have omitted validating their models against atmospheric data, which is where the greenhouse gas effect occurs. NOAA funds organizations that systematically ignore the scientific method and fail to test their predictions against physical evidence. The findings of these organizations cannot be considered scientific. Another NOAA activity that is considered scientific but fails the scientific method is ocean acidification which was boosted when environmental ecologist Jane Lubchenco was administrator of NOAA during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. The claim that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will acidify the oceans contains a bit of scientific fact surrounded by a bodyguard of lies and omissions. As a gas, water vapor contains no CO2 and has a pH of 7 which is neutral. But when it liquefies in the atmosphere and falls as rain, it absorbs CO2 making a weak acid, carbonic acid. All rain is carbonic acid and has a pH ranging from 4 to 6. Thus, it is common that in land areas with moderate to heavy rainfall, such as the tropics, the soils are acidic. Millions of years of rainfall have washed CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans. Roughly, there is about 50 to 60 times more carbon dioxide in oceans than in the atmosphere. So, direct rainfall will slightly increase CO2 in the oceans, slightly lowering the pH. Yet after millions of years of rainfall, the oceans are alkaline with pH of about 8.1. A fact that NOAA and others ignore. To recall, the acidity or alkalinity of a solution is measured by the pH scale with 7 as neutral. The scale is a base 10 logarithm. Alkaline drain cleaner has a pH of about 14; bleach has a pH of about 13. Is bleach 10 times more acidic than alkaline drain cleaner? Hen eggs have a pH of about 8 (oceans 8.1); sweet cream butter has a pH of about 6.0 to 6.7. Does cooking eggs in butter make them acidic? Further, the areas in the oceans, called Marine primary production areas or regions, are areas where ocean upwellings bring carbon dioxide and other nutrients to the surface and marine life flourishes. Examples are the Grand Banks in the Atlantic off Canada, the area off Monterey, California, off Canada and Alaska, and off most of Europe. As with most such distortions, the claim of ocean acidification requires a huge ignorance of geological history. Mollusks evolved in the Cambrian explosion of life, about 540 million years ago, when CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were about ten times what they are today. Marine creatures with shells containing calcium carbonate evolved before then, with even higher concentrations of CO2. Great limestone beds were laid down during the hot, high CO2 Cambrian period. Reef building corals evolved around 245 million years ago. Since then, Earth has experienced periods far hotter than today and periods with CO2 concentrations far greater than today. Reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues. The coral provides the algae with a protected environment and the carbon dioxide and nitrogen (for chlorophyll and other compounds) needed for photosynthesis, while the algae, through photosynthesis, provides the coral with energy, nutrients, and their vibrant colors. Changes in water temperatures, salinity, or solar irradiance can cause corals to expel the algae, turning them white. They are not dead but may need a different variety of zooxanthellae, which are diverse with many clades (groups of organisms believed to have a common ancestor) and types. There is no reason to assume that a modest lowering of pH will kill corals any more than slow changes in temperatures will kill them. However, human causes including sediment from land disturbances and destructive fishing practices such as using dynamite and cyanide do kill them. Water running into the oceans for millions of years often passes over many types of alkaline material resulting in a pH of about 8.1, alkaline. The best scientific explanation why increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will not acidify the oceans TWTW has seen was written by the late Roger Cohen and William Happer ten years ago. The paper is mathematical, but the summary is clear. The authors begin the section titled Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean with: Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2 and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4− 2, which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water. Further, the authors explain how weak acids (notably carbonic acid (H2CO3)) make rainwater slightly acidic, with a pH = 5.4 (vinegar has pH ~ 3). The authors estimate that if the oceans were not buffered by weak acids, the oceans would have a pH of about 11.4. The Summary states [figures not shown here, boldface added]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed. For example: • The oceans would be highly alkaline with a pH of about 11.4, similar to that of household ammonia, if there were no weak acids to buffer the alkalinity. Almost all of the buffering is provided by dissolved CO2, with very minor additional buffering from boric acid, silicic acid, and other even less important species. • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the pH of ocean water from about 8.2 to 7.9. This is well within the day-night fluctuations that already occur because of photosynthesis by plankton and less than the pH decreases with depth that occur because of the biological pump and the dissolution of calcium carbonate precipitates below the lysocline. [The depth where the rate of dissolution of calcium carbonate starts to increase significantly due to these changes in pressure and temperature.] • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the carbonate-ion concentration, [CO2− 3], by about 30%. Ocean surface waters are already supersaturated by several hundred per cent for formation of CaCO3 crystals from Ca2+ and CO2− 3. So, scare stories about dissolving carbonate shells are nonsense. • The ocean has only absorbed 1/3 or less of the CO2 that it would eventually absorb when the concentrations of CO2 in the deep oceans came to equilibrium with surface concentrations. Effects like that of the biological pump and calcium carbonate dissolution below the lysocline allow the ocean to absorb substantially more than the amount that would be in chemical-equilibrium with the atmosphere. • Over most of the Phanerozoic, the past 550 million years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been measured in thousands of parts per million, and life flourished in both the oceans and on land. This is hardly surprising, given the relative insensitivity of ocean pH to large changes in CO2 concentrations that we have discussed above and given the fact that the pH changes that do occur are small compared to the natural variations of ocean pH in space and time.” This is another instance where US government “science” is so politicized that it becomes nonsense. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Censorship: An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” The Synopsis of the report states: Misleading information about the causes and consequences of climate change obstructs effective policy responses. This Summary for Policymakers summarizes findings from the larger Synthesis Report “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review” (SR2025.1). The central conclusion of the Synthesis Report is that powerful actors—including corporations, governments, and political parties—intentionally spread inaccurate or misleading narratives about anthropogenic climate change. These narratives circulate across digital, broadcast, and interpersonal communication channels. The result is a decline in public trust, diminished policy coordination, and a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction. There is a severe gap in research on climate information integrity in the Global South, where impacts are likely to be significant but poorly documented. Key takeaways from the synthesis include: 1. coordinated misinformation campaigns actively shape climate narratives; 2. scientific consensus is frequently misrepresented in media; 3. regulatory enforcement and access to data remain uneven globally; 4. information integrity research is heavily concentrated in the Global North. The report concludes with an assessment of policy recommendations that have been made over time, identifying for policymakers the four areas where impact has been consistently positive: • legislation to ensure standardized carbon reporting and labelling, • litigation to ensure enforcement of the standards, • coalition building across stakeholder groups, • education of policymakers and the public. This study delivers the first global, systematic assessment of information integrity about climate science. It draws on research by hundreds of scholars and thousands of peer-reviewed studies published over the past decade, with a methodologically rigorous review of 300 papers on policy solutions. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers must enact to shield humankind—and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat. In short, this group proclaims that it understands scientific knowledge from “scientific consensus” and any group presenting physical evidence contradicting them should be punished. This organization produced another report titled: “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review.” It claims that [citations omitted here but in report, boldface added]: “The United Nations (UN) has played an important role in placing the issue of information integrity on public and policy agendas, including for the area of climate change. In 2024, the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity were presented; that year also witnessed the launch of the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, spearheaded by Brazil and coordinated through UNESCO. The Global Principles highlighted the need for ‘independent, free and pluralistic media’ around the world as vehicles of information and opinion formation. They also called for more “transparency and research” into whether and how traditional media and online communication platforms maintain information integrity in the public interest. That publication, however, stopped short of offering an explicit or operational definition of information integrity. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers (see SFP2025.2) must enact to shield humankind— and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat.” Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall uncovered a UN Human Rights Council report that calls for punishment of those who oppose abandoning fossil fuels. The summary of the report states: “The present report clarifies States’ international human rights obligations and businesses’ responsibilities to phase out fossil fuels and related subsidies within the current decade. The interlinked, intergenerational, severe and widespread human rights impacts of the fossil fuel life cycle, coupled with six decades of climate obstruction, compel urgent defossilization of our whole economies, for a just transition that is effective, human rights based and transformative in protecting the climate, nature, water and food on which life and health for present and future generations depend.” [Boldface added] For example, Richard Lindzen and William Happer used the scientific method to expose the folly of Net Zero. Are they to be punished for producing physical evidence contradicting the claims of the UN organizations which, for years, have led the effort to abandon fossil fuels which are needed for reliable electricity, heat, and transportation? Do UN bureaucrats and their defenders believe they have the right to determine the truth of scientific principles? The quote of the week is: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman. If misinformation on the causes and extent of climate change becomes a criminal offence, would the UN be a criminal organization? Has the UN become an advocate for causing destitute poverty and starvation (by prohibiting use of artificial fertilizer which produce greenhouse gases)? See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science ********************** An Existential Threat? It is commonplace for promoters of fear of climate change to call climate change an existential threat. But what the term means is not clear. Clinical psychologist Andrew Hartz provides an explanation of the use of existential threat. See Article # 1. ********************** DDP Conference: The 23rth annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness will be held in Tucson, Arizona, from July 4 to 6. The program features the 2022 Nobel co-Laureate in Physics John Clauser speaking on “Serious errors and fudges in the IPCC et al.’s global power balance structure, albedo, and climate feedback assessments.” Other noted speakers of interest to TWTW readers include Willie Soon, “Measuring the Earth’s Energy Budget”: Michael Connolly “Balloons in the Air: Revisiting Atmospheric Physics, with Data”; Joe Leimkuhler, “Prospects for the U.S. Petroleum Industry”; Jim Steele “Understanding Natural Climate Dynamics Best Prepares Us for Weather Disasters”; and David Legates “9.5 Weeks: My Time in the White House.” For registration in person or by Zoom see https://aaps.wufoo.com/forms/q1f6wbjr18g6o47/ ********************* SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. Send your vote to Ken@Sepp.org. If you wish, you will be anonymous. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. ********************* Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved. DEMAND: On June 20, the business day with the longest period of sunlight, the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) reported that the demand trend for electricity fell to its lowest point at about 12:30 pm (local time) with a demand of 19,500 MW. About 6:30 pm demand began peaking at 28,000 MW and remained there or above until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW. Except between about 10 am and 3 pm, demand did not go below 22,000 MW. SUPPLY: On the same day, renewables (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biomass, Biogas, and Small Hydro) reached a near peak of about 25,000 MW at 8:30 am and remained there or more until 5:30 pm when they fell dramatically to about 7,500 MW at 8 pm where they remained the rest of the evening. When it is functioning solar is the biggest generator at over 18,000 MW with wind second at about 5,000 MW. Large hydro provided an average of about 3,750 MW for the rest of the evening and Nuclear about 2,280 MW. The rest of the electricity came from imports (mostly coal and other fossil fuels), and batteries. The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. On the longest business day of the year for sunshine, after 8:00 pm CAISO needed 28,000 MW of power until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW while renewables were delivering 7,500 MW and batteries were delivering between 7,000 and 8,000 MW until 10 pm when they declined. Based on rough calculations, just for that evening (8 pm to midnight) CAISO needed 110,000 MWh of power while renewables delivered 30,000 MWh and the power delivered by large hydro alone was about 14,280 MWh. Thus, taking away nuclear, the shortfall would be about 35,000 MWh. Existing batteries delivered about 27,000 MWh and California just approved the “World’s Largest’ Energy Storage Site” with 4,600 kWh (4.6 MWh) of battery storage with no costs given. If California goes net zero with no nuclear, what will California do on a cold, windless night in January? How will it replenish its batteries? If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California? According to the US EIA, except for isolated Hawaii, residential electricity prices in California are already the highest in the country. In March, the US national average was 17.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, while in California it was 32.41 cents per kilowatt-hour and Hawaii 41.11.

Darwall: Yes, I think I can. Because in 2006 there was the meeting of the G8 which was in St Petersburg hosted by Vladimir Putin. And the leaders of the west along with Vladimir Putin signed up to a document called the St. Petersburg Principles of Energy Security. In that document the leaders of the west said that they needed to invest trillions of dollars across all the value chain, the whole oil and gas value chain.

Santer, Susan Solomon, et al., PNAS, June 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. [SEPP Comment: A thought fantasy, not a thought experiment. The state-of-the-art climate models produce results that are wrong. Why bother with a thought experiment until the state-of-the-art models produce accurate predictions that are supported by physical evidence? Further, in the mid-19th century, Europe was emerging from the Little Ice Age which killed hundreds of thousands from starvation and related diseases. Why would warming be considered harmful to humanity? Finally, the authors cite the early work of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius but not his 1908 paper which admitted his early work was wrong. But he also misunderstood the chemistry of water vapor, it is not gaseous carbonic acid.] Warning signs on climate flashing bright red: Top scientists By Marlowe Hood, Phys.org, June 19, 2025 Link to paper: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2024: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence By Piers Forster, et al.

Or not, once they see how tiny the effects are in the alarmists’ own calculations. For instance, if we assume climate sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is a 3°C temperature increase, and that the US cuts its emissions right away by 40 percent, by the year 2100 global warming will have been reduced by… 0.06 degrees C. Put that in your thermometer and measure it.

Beijing began building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-powered capacity in 2024, in addition to resuming 3.3 GW of suspended projects. This is the highest level of construction in the past 10 years! As recently as May, China deployed the world’s largest fleet of driverless mining trucks to fast-track efficient operations, partially to overcome the challenging conditions of harsh winter weather at the Yimin coal mine in northeastern Inner Mongolia. Oceans absorb 30% of our emissions, driven by a huge carbon pump. Tiny marine animals are key to working out its climate impacts Marine life known as zooplankton might be the biggest problem with getting carbon cycling right in climate models.

The 46+ year trend remains at +0.15 C/decade, but we note the value is +0.155 C/decade, so we added another decimal point in the header. We estimate the error range of this trend over 46+ years at ±0.03 C/decade which renders the third decimal inconsequential. Changing Weather Water Shortage? Blame It On Climate Change!! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 19, 2025 Quite how they think they can get away with such bare-faced lies is a mystery. They clearly don’t want to put too much emphasis on mass immigration, which has forced up population numbers, even though they now assume population in England will rise by 8 million in the next thirty years. But lying about climate change is now a stock in trade for government. [SEPP Comment: See link immediately below.] Droughts To Cause Flooding!

This sponsored “journalism” by the infamous Seattle Times ClimateLab, is based on a report by a well-known climate change advocacy group, Climate Central. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? A weak wind By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, what has the Washington Post to say on the quietest hurricane season globally since 1970? Why, it was completely quiet about it. (As it was on “climate” save for a mention of a prediction from the Climate Prediction Center.) Unless you count “This spurt of activity shows no signs of ending for now.” Yes. “This spurt of activity” is actually how they describe the quietest start to a season in more than half a century. Satire can’t keep up. And no matter how cynical you get, it’s not enough. Major Errors in Seattle Times ClimateLab Article on Sea-level Rise By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, June 20, 2025 My frustration with the often false, misleading, and exaggerated information pushed by the Seattle Times ClimateLab is frequently expressed in this blog, but the tall tales provided this week is worth a rating of at least four Pinocchios. The story suggests that the Samish Tribe of NW Washington has to “race” to document their heritage sites because rising sea level and “intensifying storm surges” remove any chance to understand their significance.” In reality, none of this is true.

Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column. [SEPP Comment: According to the NAS press release, speculating from discoveries at a few inches deep is discovering facts at 36,000 feet deep?] Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up. May be hot, maybe not By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 Point zero six above 2020? Can they say with a straight face that they’ve measured global temperature comprehensively to that degree of precision? Of course not. We’re not even buying the 0.1, let alone the 2 that followed it. As for that estimated 1850-1900 average, as we’ve said before, if you think we know the temperature for every square foot of what was then the Belgian Congo in 1873, or the mid-Pacific, or for that matter Rome, you are a chump or worse. IRA Incentives Fuel U.S. Solar Manufacturing Surge By Aaron Larson, Power Mag, June 11, 2025 The centerpiece of this revival is the IRA’s comprehensive package of tax incentives designed to rebuild America’s solar supply chain. The domestic content bonus tax credit offers project developers an additional 10% on top of the base 30% investment tax credit (ITC) when they use U.S.-made components. This creates demand-side pull for domestically manufactured solar products. According to U.S. Treasury Department data, more than $196 billion in clean power investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage, demonstrating the market’s strong response to these incentives. [Boldface added] [SEPP Comment: More deceit, America never had a solar supply chain to rebuild.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Amber Alerts For Sunny Weather By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 19, 2025 “Amber heat health alerts are in place across the whole of England with temperatures likely to exceed 30C [86F] for the first time this year.” Meanwhile back in the real world, summer remains the season when deaths tolls are at their lowest: ‘Climate Grieving’ at UK Centre for Climate Psychology By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, June 17, 2025 The organization has a flagship book, Climate, Psychology and Change: Reimagining Psychotherapy in an Era of Global Disruption and Climate Anxiety.

Our food systems will break down. Billions will be forced out of their homes and countries. This means war, starvation, slaughter, and rape on a global scale. And the collapse is coming here, too. The science is clear: the use of fossil fuels must end, immediately, if we hope to survive. Instead of leading the transition, our government gambles our future on unproven technologies and hopeful thinking… while quietly continuing to fund and faciliate the fossil fuel death project. Questioning European Green Kathryn Porter Reviews The Spanish Blackouts Report By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 Link to: Should NESO [UK Electrical system operator] be allowed to lower its minimum inertia requirement? By Kathryn Porter, Watt-Logic, June 18, 2025 From Porter: Whether this ambition will be possible even with the dodgy carbon accounting rules is unclear. In the summer months, gas power stations are often turned up by the system operator in order to stabilize the grid, providing important inertia to control voltage across the network. Throughout the summer, NESO has observed unexplained voltage oscillations (which I will discuss in another post – this is being held up by junk frequency data being reported to Elexon which has yet to be corrected, despite Elexon requesting re-submission), including on the day before the Iberian blackout. These oscillations can, in extreme circumstances, cause the type of grid failure that led to the loss of eleven lives on 28 April in Spain and Portugal. Spain’s Impossible Dream Of ‘Green’ Electricity By Paul Driessen, WUWT, June 17, 2025 How Much Does The UK Govt Spend On Net Zero By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 17, 2025 But even the quantifiable costs above add up to £24 billion a year, excluding Sizewell C [Nuclear power plant].

Questioning Green Elsewhere G-7: Africans Deserve Real Electricity By Brenda Shaffer, Real Clear Energy, June 17, 2025 Data on electricity access in U. S. government, IEA, World Bank, and UN reports should be categorized as reliable or not. Africans receiving a few hours a day of unreliable power should not be counted as achieving full electricity access. ‘Net Zero’ Is Collapsing in U.S. States By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, June 16, 2025 Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, how’s that green transition working for you? Oh. Not so good? For instance, from way down south we hear that “The initial cost of producing green hydrogen from Australia’s two largest projects will be more than four times the price of rival energy sources, posing a fresh setback for Labor’s bid to deliver a major new export ­industry by 2030 and meet net-zero goals.” And you told us you had it all figured out. Blockbuster: Mark Carney, Mr Net-Zero-Banker himself, now uses oil, gas to make Canada an Energy SuperPower By Jo Nova, Her Blog, June 17, 2025 The US is the world’s top producer of oil at the moment, with 44 billion barrels of oil in reserve. Amazingly Canada has four times as much — or 171 billion barrels of oil in recoverable reserves, says the Telegraph. It’s amazing how stupid rich countries can be — to leave, as Alberta’s premier says, “$9 trillion worth of oil wealth we have in the ground”? Speaking of stupid, perhaps the greatest and saddest irony is that Mark Carney once was the green-extreme Governor of the Bank of England. And while there, he helped tie the UK down in carbon markets and energy transitions that still cripple their economy.

Energy Issues – Non-US Spanish Blackouts Due To “Miscalculation”! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 18, 2025 “The massive power cut that plunged huge swathes of Spain and Portugal into chaos earlier this year was caused by a miscalculation, the Spanish government has said.” No, Sky, it was not a miscalculation. It was the inevitable result of running the grid mainly on highly variable, low inertia renewables. That in turn was the consequence of deliberate government policy. What will happen then, when Spain has succeeded in finally shutting down all of its gas plants? The Lethal Fog of Clean-Air Hypocrisy By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, June 18, 2025 Why do environmental extremists expect Nairobi, Dhaka or Lagos to skip the rational evolution of energy use that so benefited the lives and economies of the U.K. – and of many other western nations? Why do they think an African mother should wait decades – or forever – to cook without smoke? The answer lies in an elitist worldview that treats energy as a lifestyle choice rather than a lifeline. America as a Reliable Energy Partner By Fred H. Hutchison, Real Clear Energy, June 19, 2025 The statement that drew the fierce rebuttal was that “for fifty years Europe saw Russia as a reliable natural gas supplier… and now there is growing concern that Europe may be headed towards over reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States.” NESO Winter Outlook By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 “The National Energy System Operator (Neso), which oversees Britain’s electricity grid, said it would import power from France and other nearby European neighbors this winter to help backstop the network.” Homewood: NESO don’t publish the actual numbers – this will wait till their full Outlook later in the year. But they are projecting around 15 GW of renewables, which looks grossly optimistic. There will be no solar power generated when demand peaks in early evening, and we have regularly seen wind power drop to less than 2 GW. (Biomass, it appears, is included under thermal).

The flashpoint is centered on when large customers seek to bypass conventional transmission planning and cost allocation by co-locating directly with generation sources. That practice, often framed as “behind-the-meter” or “non-network” load development, has raised concerns from grid operators, utilities, and regulators who argue that even ostensibly self-supplied data centers still rely on the broader grid for backup, balancing, and reliability services.

The ultimate goal of energy tax credits is not to reduce tax burdens, but to help companies bring a larger amount of lower-cost and cleaner energy to the market — benefiting the American people. Cash is often preferable to tax credits in accomplishing that goal. The third policy is all the more relevant given this demand surge: restoring support for solar leasing companies. Solar leasing directly benefits U.S. homeowners by allowing them to install panels on their property with a monthly payment plan instead of swallowing the upfront cost. Not only does rooftop solar drive down consumer electricity costs, but it also gives Americans more independence by helping them to get off the grid and cut their reliance on utility companies.

By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, June 16, 2025 The greatest oxymoron statement of all time: ‘Renewable Energy’ By Ronald Stein and Roger Caiazza, America Out Loud News, June 16, 2025 Wind and solar projects that generate electricity under favorable weather conditions only exist because of government subsidies that finance these projects. To date, none of the wind and solar projects around the world have ever been financed with private capital, as there is no return on such investments. Claims that renewables are cheaper overlook the costs of backing up those sources when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. When included, costs are much higher.

Climate change, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, pandemics and more threaten to return us to nothingness. Most people using this term aren’t consciously evoking the philosophy of Sartre or Camus. Still, they may be drawing on associations with existentialism more than they realize and unconsciously expressing deeper concerns about morality and meaning. In psychoanalysis, it isn’t unusual for a word to have an unconscious double meaning. For example, a patient in therapy might say that she can’t ‘bear’ children. She could consciously mean that she’s unable to get pregnant, while also unconsciously communicating that she can’t stand children. Or a grieving patient who’s struggling to find the right word might say, ‘I’m at a loss.’ Similarly, the word ‘existential’ points to catastrophic global threats, but it also echoes the concerns of existentialist philosophy, which addresses a range of topics from freedom to alienation. But the term is most strongly linked in the public imagination to issues of death and meaning. Saying an issue is ‘existential’ can express that it’s deeply tied to one’s fear of dying and need for purpose. We don’t have to overthink every word we say or hear, but there are signals that a word may have an unconscious double meaning. Therapists tend to think this phenomenon is most likely to occur when a word is used in an odd way—when it’s emotionally charged, when it’s repeated excessively or when it has clear resonance with one’s psychological concerns. The recent political use of the word ‘existential’ seems to check every box. People in the U.S. are shouting about how politics is ‘existential’ at the same time that American society is suffering from a marked crisis of purpose. The term is strange and was used rarely in the past, but its use has been increasing as people have become less able to tolerate the risks and uncertainties of life. Recent events—the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, the increasing secularization of society—could have triggered Americans’ existential concerns. Perhaps other factors are at play as well. For many, social-media platforms intensify feelings of insignificance. A loneliness epidemic might heighten anxieties about meaning. Distrust of authority can lead to feelings of confusion and insecurity. Whatever the causes, the sense that everything is an existential crisis is likely exacerbated by the increasing emotional fragility of younger generations. A prominent psychological theory, Terror Management Theory, posits that all people have anxiety about their mortality and that they cope with it in predictable ways. A robust body of evidence indicates that when people are reminded of their death, they try to boost their self-esteem, take steps to create a legacy and defend their worldview—be it secular or religious. An extension of this theory is that people cope with anxiety about death by focusing their fears onto something more tangible, such as a current political cause. That cause can then become emotionally loaded with all of their anxiety and distress about mortality. This temporarily makes their anxiety feel more manageable, but it’s likely to contribute to fanaticism and emotional dysregulation around politics. Political causes aimed at tackling ‘existential’ risks are often associated with safety culture. People seem to have an unconscious hope that regulations could protect them from ever dying. Sometimes, these rules and rituals even take on an obsessive-compulsive quality, as if the repetitions will magically stave off unknown risks. Many Covid practices had this flavor.” The author states the most clinicians think that fears of annihilation are fundamental influences on behavior which results in outlooks such as the world is going to be destroyed. He then concludes with: “Often, people come to yearn for an omnipotent state as the means to protect them from all their fears. They imagine total state control to protect them from all the internal feelings they can’t tolerate. Anxieties like this can easily become fodder for authoritarianism. Politics won’t solve our deeper problems. Meaning and purpose have to be found on one’s own, and people must develop ways to manage the uncertainties and risks of life. This can be challenging, but it’s the only path toward fulfillment, wisdom and freedom—to say nothing of mental health.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

As the ocean warms, a new study found it’s also changing color https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article308985125.html Supreme Court Rules Fuel Producers Can Contest California’s Emissions Regulations The 7-2 ruling emphasized that it was not considering the substance of the dispute itself, but solely whether the producers had the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. The justices in a 7-2 ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to throw out the lawsuit by a Valero Energy (VLO.N) subsidiary and fuel industry groups. The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to let California set its own regulations. “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority. What is this? “ If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California?” I was not aware that CA exported nuclear power to the BPA. “An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” What a name! Why not just call themselves “The Ministry of Truth”? The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. And what is so ridiculous is that even could they manage to do it, it would have no material effect on the level of global emissions. Because California is not a big enough emitter for it to make much difference to the global total. It is utterly crazy how people insist on doing these expensive and completely ineffective things ‘because climate’, when even if the theory is correct, they will make no difference to the climate.

Δ Overall, the index slipped a scant 0.02%, as six pillars lost ground and five pillars advanced. In doing so, the CE 100 pantheon outperformed all of its broader benchmarks, as, for example, the S&P lost 0.5%. Banking names surged the most, adding 3%. LendingClub advanced by 5.3%. The company announced the rollout of its LevelUp Checking. The new offering is designed to help consumers move away from reliance on credit cards, especially given record-high credit card debt, by incentivizing the use of debit with rewards tied to debit spending. Target customers are individuals with high FICO scores (around 725) and high incomes ($125,000 to $130,000) who, despite their earnings, often lack immediate cash and carry substantial credit card debt, CEO Scott Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told Webster in an interview. The new LevelUp Checking product gives members 1% cash back for everyday spending with a LevelUp debit card on grocery and gas, among other key categories. Members who have LendingClub personal loans can also receive 2% cash back for making on-time loan payments from the LevelUp accounts. JPMorgan Chase plans to launch a product called a “deposit token” that will serve as a digital representation of commercial bank money and will be available only to the bank’s institutional clients. The deposit token, dubbed “JPMD,” will provide an alternative to stablecoins and will be closely connected to traditional banking systems. JPMorgan Chase will launch JPMD on Coinbase’s public blockchain, Base. JPMorgan’s stock gained 3.8%. In the Pay and Be Paid segment, up 0.3%, Visa has partnered with licensed stablecoin payments orchestrator Yellow Card to explore stablecoin use cases and opportunities across the African markets in which Yellow Card is licensed to operate. Together, the companies will seek opportunities to help streamline treasury operations and enhance liquidity management as well as test integration opportunities with Visa Direct to investigate cross-border payment options, Visa said. Visa’s stock lost 4%. But buy now, pay later names were higher, marked by Sezzle’s 10% rally and Affirm’s 5% boost. As PYMNTS reported, Affirm has announced a new revolving pass-through loan sale facility in which PGIM Fixed Income, a Prudential Financial company, will invest up to $3 billion over 36 months by purchasing up to $500 million of Affirm loans at any one time. This facility, which marks an expansion of the companies’ existing capital partnership, will support Affirm’s offering of pay-over-time options to consumers, the companies said. The Be Well sector led declining stocks, losing 2.5%. Peloton dipped by 11%, trading lower since news earlier this month that Peloton introduced its own peer-to-peer resale marketplace, Repowered. Users can list their pre-owned equipment and accessories from the connected fitness company on the Repowered platform. Sellers determine the listing price, aided by a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. In the Enablers group, which lost 0.3%, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has reportedly accused Meta of offering nine-figure signing bonuses to poach his workers. Shares gave up 0.7%. Amazon’s stock lost 1.1%. In a message penned by CEO Andy Jassy, and as reported by PYMNTS, employees who have learned how to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. Jassy added that Amazon’s total corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company adopts AI. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message.

Cookies help us display personalized product recommendations and ensure you have great shopping experience. Accept X Since we took over Smart Data Collective, we’ve made it a priority to focus on how artificial intelligence influences the practical side of data mining. You often hear about machine learning in broad strokes, but we aim to look at how these tools handle the messy reality of raw data. You can’t overstate the damage poor data quality causes. It is estimated by IBM that this issue costs U.S. businesses over $3.1 trillion every year. Keep reading to learn more. There are many ways AI helps clean up large datasets, especially in eliminating duplicates, correcting formats, and filling in gaps. You might have hundreds of spreadsheets from various sources, but AI can bring consistency to it all. You save hundreds of hours compared to doing it manually. It is easy to forget how quickly companies have scaled up their spending on AI tools. CNBC reports that Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft alone plan to spend up to $320 billion on AI and datacenter infrastructure in 2025. You can see how high the stakes have become when tech giants place that much of their budget behind it. There are not many industries left untouched by this trend. You might assume only tech companies are involved, but even traditional sectors are leaning on AI for their data work. There are organizations earning over $500 million a year, and according to Computer Weekly, they’re putting 5% of their revenue into AI projects. You often need advanced tools just to keep up with the amount of data modern businesses generate. It is not just about cleaning and sorting—AI also helps find patterns in customer behavior, supply chains, and market trends. You can build models that predict when people are most likely to make a purchase or when a part in a machine is likely to fail. There are no shortcuts, but AI brings new power to long-standing business challenges. I still remember the first time I tried to scrape data from a website for a project. I was hunched over my laptop, wrestling with Python scripts, cursing at broken CSS selectors, and wondering if the website’s layout would change before I could even finish my code. Fast forward to today, and the world of data extraction has been completely flipped on its head. The rise of AI web scrapers has not only made my life easier, but it’s also reshaping how entire data teams work—making data more accessible, workflows more efficient, and headaches a lot less frequent. Let’s be honest: the sheer volume of data online is exploding. In 2024, the world created about 149 zettabytes of data, and that number is expected to hit 181 zettabytes by 2025. With 97% of businesses investing in big data and 81% saying data is at the heart of decision-making, the pressure on data teams to deliver timely, high-quality web data has never been higher. But traditional scraping tools just can’t keep up. Enter the age of AI web scrapers—where automation, context-awareness, and accessibility are changing the rules for everyone. So, what exactly is an AI web scraper? Unlike the old-school scrapers that rely on brittle CSS selectors or XPath rules, AI web scrapers use natural language processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition to “read” web pages more like a human would. Instead of telling the tool, “Go grab the third <td> in this table,” you can just say, “Extract product names, prices, and ratings from this page,” and let the AI figure out the rest. What’s really exciting is the rise of AI agents—these are smart automation bots that can interpret your instructions, adapt to different websites, and even handle dynamic content or subpages. Tools like Thunderbit are leading the way here, making it possible for non-technical users (like sales teams, marketers, or real estate analysts) to scrape clean, structured data in just a couple of clicks. No more late-night debugging sessions or praying that your script survives the next website redesign. Having spent years in the trenches with Python scripts and selector-based tools, I can tell you: traditional web scraping is a slog. Tools like Oxylabs, Bright Data API, Octoparse, and ParseHub all require you to set up extraction rules for each website. That means: And let’s not forget the skill gap. Most traditional scrapers require at least some coding chops, which means business users are stuck waiting for the data team to build or fix things. It’s a bottleneck that slows everyone down. Let’s break it down: building a robust scraper for a single site can take hours or even days. Maintenance is an ongoing battle—one small change in the HTML and your whole pipeline can grind to a halt. Add in the need for proxies, anti-bot measures, and infrastructure for scaling, and suddenly your “quick script” is a full-blown engineering project. And the kicker? All that effort is just to keep the data flowing. If you’re dealing with dozens or hundreds of sites, the maintenance alone can eat up a huge chunk of your team’s time and budget. Here’s where AI web scrapers really shine. By leveraging natural language processing and visual analysis, these tools automate the whole data extraction process. You don’t need to know HTML, CSS, or even what a selector is. Just describe what you want, and the AI agent takes care of the rest. This shift is huge for data teams. Instead of spending hours configuring and maintaining scripts, you can set up a new extraction in minutes. And because the AI understands context, it’s much more resilient to changes in website layout or dynamic content. I’ve seen firsthand how much easier things get with tools like Thunderbit. You just click “AI Suggest Fields,” let the AI read the page, and then hit “Scrape.” That’s it. No more wrestling with selectors or worrying about whether the site uses infinite scroll. The AI figures out what’s important, structures the data, and even handles subpages or dynamic elements. It almost feels like cheating—but in the best way possible. Let’s sum up the big wins: This is my favorite part. With traditional tools, you’d need a custom script for every site. But with AI web scrapers, a single tool can generalize across multiple websites. That means faster project turnaround, less repetitive work, and more time spent on analysis instead of data wrangling. For example, Thunderbit’s AI can scrape product listings from Amazon, property data from Zillow, or contact info from niche directories—all with the same workflow. That’s a game plan for scaling up your data operations without scaling up your headaches. Let’s get concrete. Here are some scenarios where AI web scrapers are making a real difference for data teams: For more on these use cases, check out Thunderbit’s blog. Dynamic websites used to be the bane of every scraper’s existence. JavaScript-loaded content, infinite scroll, pop-ups—traditional tools would choke or require complex workarounds. AI web scrapers, on the other hand, can mimic human browsing, interact with dynamic elements, and adapt to layout changes on the fly. This resilience means less downtime, fewer maintenance emergencies, and a lot less stress for data teams. It’s like having a super-adaptable assistant who never complains about late-night website redesigns. Thinking about making the switch? Here’s how I’d approach it: For a step-by-step guide, check out How to Scrape Any Website Using AI. Looking ahead, I see AI web scrapers getting even smarter and more integrated into business workflows. We’re talking about: The bottom line? Data teams will spend less time on extraction and more time on strategy, analysis, and decision-making. The rise of AI web scrapers is more than just a technological upgrade—it’s a shift in how data teams operate. We’re moving from manual, brittle, and high-maintenance workflows to a world where automation, adaptability, and accessibility are the norm. If your team is still stuck in the old world of manual scripts and selector headaches, it’s time to take a look at what AI web scrapers can do. Tools like Thunderbit are making it easier than ever to turn the web into your personal data warehouse—no code, no stress, just results. Ready to see what’s possible?

Title: The stablecoin evangelist: Katie Haun's fight for digital dollars | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In 2018, when Bitcoin was trading around $4,000 and most Americans, at least, thought cryptocurrency was a fad, Katie Haun found herself on a debate stage in Mexico City opposite Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist. As Krugman focused on Bitcoin’s wild price swings, Haun steered the conversation toward something else — stablecoins. “Stablecoins are really interesting and really important to this ecosystem to hedge against that volatility,” she argued onstage, explaining how digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar could offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the ups and downs of traditional cryptocurrencies. Krugman dismissed the idea entirely. It wasn’t exactly a turning point in Haun’s career, but it was one moment among others that have helped define it. A former federal prosecutor, Haun brings an unusual background to crypto investing, having spent over a decade investigating financial crimes and creating the government’s first cryptocurrency task force. After becoming the first female partner at Andreessen Horowitz in 2018 and co-leading its crypto funds, she founded Haun Ventures in 2022 with over $1.5 billion in assets under management. Hanging her own shingle hasn’t been without its complexities. Despite her role at a16z and the industry connections that came with it, the two haven’t publicly co-invested in anything since shortly after she launched her fund, and Haun stepped down from Coinbase’s board last year while Marc Andreessen remains a director. When asked Wednesday night at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event about her relationship with Andreessen Horowitz, she downplayed any potential friction while acknowledging they aren’t collaborators exactly. “There’s no ‘gentleman’s agreement,’” she said, echoing this editor’s question about whether there’s any understanding to avoid competing with her former employer. “In fact, I still talk to Andreessen Horowitz. You’re right that we haven’t really done any deals together of late.” The apparent lack of co-investment could reflect the cutthroat industry or the challenges associated with leaving one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent firms to compete directly with former colleagues. Whatever the case, Haun is now charting her own course, and at the heart of it is stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in value, stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or Tether’s USDT are meant to trade at exactly $1, creating a digital representation of traditional currency that can move on blockchain networks. Indeed, fast-forward to today, and Haun’s belief in stablecoins looks increasingly prescient. Stablecoins — which barely existed in 2015 — now represent a quarter of a trillion dollars in value. They’ve become the 14th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries globally. Reportedly, for the first time last year, stablecoin transaction volume exceeded Visa’s. “I think people who looked at stablecoins a few years ago thought, what is the value prop?” Haun said Wednesday night. “You’ve asked me this before. You said, ‘Why do I need stablecoins?’ And I said, ‘I refer to this as an ‘If it works for me, it works for everyone’ problem.” In reality, for most Americans, the existing financial system works reasonably well. We have Venmo, bank accounts, credit cards. But Haun, drawing on her prosecutor’s understanding of global financial systems, says she has long been aware that the U.S. experience isn’t universal. In countries with unstable currencies or limited banking infrastructure, stablecoins offer something unique, she argues, which is instant access to stable, dollar-denominated value that can be sent anywhere in the world for pennies. “People in Turkey don’t think of Tether as a cryptocurrency,” she said Wednesday. “They think of Tether as money.” The technology has evolved dramatically since those early debates, certainly. Stablecoins once cost $12 to send internationally. And Circle says its USDC stablecoin is fully backed one-to-one by dollars held in JP Morgan bank accounts and audited by Big Four accounting firms. Little wonder the corporate world is taking notice in a big way. Walmart and Amazon are reportedly exploring stablecoins, as are other goliaths like Uber, Apple, and Airbnb. The reason is simple economics. Stablecoins provide a way to move the value of U.S. dollars using cryptocurrency rails instead of traditional banking infrastructure, potentially saving these retail-heavy companies billions in processing fees. But the shift has critics worried about economic chaos. While Circle and Tether are committed to having enough reserves to support their tokens, unlike traditional banks, there’s no insured government protection behind these reserves. Relatedly, if major corporations can issue their own currencies, what happens to monetary policy and banking regulation? The concerns run deeper than just economic disruption. Not all stablecoins are created equal, and many lack the backing and oversight that companies like Circle provide. While well-regulated stablecoins like USDC are backed by actual dollars in U.S. Treasury securities, others operate with less transparency or rely on complex algorithmic mechanisms that have proven vulnerable to collapse. (TerraUSD has had the most specular crash to date, wiping out $60 billion in value when it nosedived.) Corruption concerns in particular came into sharp focus recently when President Donald Trump’s family issued its own stablecoin, a move that highlighted potential conflicts of interest in an industry where political influence can directly impact market value and regulatory outcomes. These concerns came to a head as Congress debated the GENIUS Act, legislation that would create a federal framework for stablecoin regulation. The bill passed the Senate early last week with bipartisan support, with 14 Democrats crossing party lines to support it. It now awaits a House vote before potentially reaching the president’s desk. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, has been particularly vocal in her opposition, calling the legislation a “superhighway for Donald Trump’s corruption.” Her criticism centers on a notable gap in the bill: While it prohibits members of Congress and senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products, it says nothing about their family members. Asked about Warren’s concerns on Wednesday night, Haun practically rolled her eyes. “I think it’s really ironic that Elizabeth Warren or other Democrats who do call this corruption are not running to pass crypto legislation,” she said. “Had there been rules of the road in place [already], there would have been a framework, there would have been clear rules for what’s a security, what’s a commodity, and what are the consumer protections around that.” Haun — whose venture capital firm has made numerous stablecoin investments, including Bridge (acquired by Stripe for reportedly 10 times forward revenue) — is largely supportive of the legislation, unsurprisingly. But she had one notable criticism when asked what she doesn’t like about it: the bill’s prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins. “I’m not sure that yield-bearing stablecoins are a good idea for consumers in the U.S., but I’m not sure that a prohibition is a good idea,” she told StrictlyVC attendees. The issue comes down to who profits from the interest earned on stablecoin reserves. Currently, that money goes to companies like Circle and Coinbase. But Haun wonders why consumers shouldn’t get that yield, just like they would with a savings account. “If you had a savings account or checking account and you’re getting yield on that, you’re getting interest,” she explained. “What if you just said, ‘No, the bank gets interest, not you,’ and they’re lending out your money?” Haun was less nuanced when it comes to another Warren concern: that if the GENIUS Act is signed into law, stablecoins could become a vehicle for money laundering and terrorism financing. “Criminals are great beta testers of all technologies,” said Haun. “But this technology is highly traceable, way more traceable than cash. The largest criminal instrument is the dollar bill.” (According to Haun, the Treasury Department has testified that 99.9% of money-laundering crimes succeed using traditional bank wires, not cryptocurrency.) Meanwhile, she said, the regulatory clarity that legislation like the GENIUS Act provides could actually make the system safer by distinguishing between legitimate, well-backed stablecoins from more experimental or risky variants. In fact, as the stablecoin ecosystem continues to mature, Haun sees even bigger changes ahead. She envisions a future where all kinds of assets — from money market funds to real estate to private credit — get “tokenized” and made available 24/7 to global markets. “It’s just a digital representation of a physical asset,” she explains. “BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, they’ve already tokenized their money market funds. That’s already happened.” According to Haun, tokenized assets could democratize access to investments in ways similar to how Netflix democratized entertainment. Instead of having to be wealthy enough to meet minimum investment thresholds, someone with $25 and a smartphone could buy fractional ownership in a share of Apple or Amazon, for example. “Just because something’s inevitable doesn’t mean it’s imminent,” Haun said on Wednesday. But she’s confident the transformation is coming, driven by the same forces that made stablecoins successful: They’re faster, cheaper, and, she insists, more accessible than traditional alternatives. Looking back at that 2018 debate with Krugman, Haun’s persistence seems to have paid off. A major question now isn’t whether digital dollars will reshape the financial system but perhaps more importantly, whether regulators can keep pace with the technology while addressing legitimate concerns about corruption, consumer protection, and financial stability. Haun doesn’t seem concerned. While critics point to the fact that stablecoins represent just 2% of global payments, questioning their product-market fit, Haun bats away that concern, too. Instead, she sees this as a familiar tech adoption story — one that has played out repeatedly and often takes longer than people initially imagine. “We think it’s really early days,” she told the crowd.

More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

Title: ELV FRAUD ALERT: Elevance Health, Inc. Investors are Reminded of Ongoing Securities Fraud Class Action -- Contact BFA Law by July 11 Legal Deadline (NYSE:ELV)

June 22, 2025 09:33 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members.

Bengaluru: Raymond Realty, which is scheduled to list on the stock exchanges on 1 July, is looking at faster growth through higher home sales and several project launches in 2025-26, said a top company executive. The real estate firm was demerged from Raymond Ltd on 1 May and will list as a standalone entity. Mumbai-based Raymond Realty clocked around ₹2,300 crore of sales in FY25, and is targeting at least 20% growth this year. It also expects a 20% return on capital employed. Also read: Gautam Singhania meets European royal Prince Albert II: Here's why they met, what they discussed & more By the end of FY26, it plans to launch six projects - two in suburban Thane, where Raymond owns about 100 acres, and four projects in different locations across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) - Wadala, Sion, Mahim and Bandra. The developer currently has six projects under execution. Raymond Realty's residential portfolio, combining projects under execution and the ones to be launched, has a gross development value (GDV) of ₹40,000 crore. Of this, projects worth ₹25,000 crore GDV would be in Thane alone. The remaining projects of ₹15,000 crore GDV are in MMR. “In the next 3-4 years, we will double our sales and portfolio size. As a company, we are trying to solve for two things in the industry - quality of projects and timely delivery. We also want to focus on post delivery service, and have started our own facilities management arm," Raymond Realty chief executive Harmohan Sahni said in an interview. Also read: Centre links part of state capex loans to new reforms in land, and digitization The demerger will consolidate the group's real estate business under a single entity, which, going forward, will further unlock the firm's potential as a pure-play property development vertical. The company will sell at a broad price range of ₹20,000-65,000 per sq ft, and is not looking to sell below that, or in the uber luxury category. “We can't go lower than ₹20,000-22,000 per sq ft. We will not dilute the brand, and it is not a price-sensitive market," he added. MMR, India's most valuable property market, stands as one of the leading contributors to pan-India launches and sales. Most of the projects Raymond Realty has signed are redevelopment projects. The newly signed projects, in Mahim and Wadala, are a Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) redevelopment and a slum redevelopment project respectively. Also read: Centre weighs easing conditions for interest-free capex loans to states “We will continue to pursue an asset-light model by signing projects through the joint development route as it is capital efficient. We are a net debt-free company," Sahni said. Beyond Mumbai, the company is exploring project opportunities to enter the Pune property market. “We are choosy about the deals we want to sign," he added. MMR among all the top cities witnessed the highest sales of around 155,335 units in 2024, almost the same as 2023. Pune followed with around 81,090 units sold. The two western markets together led residential sales last year, said Anarock Property Consultants. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity’s complexity

By Claire Sibonney, KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the co-payments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — “Star Wars,” “American Ninja Warrior” and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” ©2025 KFF Health News. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: What Analysts Think of Micron Stock Ahead of Earnings

Micron Technology (MU) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker's profits to more than double from a year ago. Analysts on average expect Micron to report revenue of $8.86 billion, up 30% year-over-year. It's projected to post adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or $1.61 per share, up from $702 million, or $0.62 per share, a year earlier. In March, the Nvidia (NVDA) partner posted quarterly revenue that topped analysts' expectations, thanks in part to data center sales tripling on growing AI demand. Of the 11 analysts covering Micron tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have a “buy” rating for the stock, alongside two “hold” ratings, though their consensus price target near $121 would suggest a slight decline from Friday’s close at $123.60. Shares of Micron have been on a tear in recent weeks, and have added nearly half of their value in 2025 so far. The results also come after Micron earlier this month announced plans to boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development. The chipmaker said most of the money would be used for "two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia," and advanced its high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities.

Title: The Sources of Global Economic Uncertainty
URL: https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/478633/
Time Published: 2025-06-22T04:45:06Z
Full Content:
22 June 2025 Time taken to read : 5 Minute The recent surge in government bond yields has forced business leaders and investors around the world to confront a critical question: Should corporations lock in debt at current interest rates before they rise further? At the same time, higher capital costs and persistent market volatility are compelling investors to reassess their portfolios. The question has become increasingly urgent as the yield on ten-year US Treasuries has climbed 50 basis points to 4.5% in less than a month. The yield on 30-year Treasuries is approaching 5% after rising 30 basis points in May alone. Beyond short-term market swings, at least five structural shifts could reshape the global economic landscape, with the potential to upend corporate strategies, erode investment returns, and further undermine growth prospects. First, there is the United States’ deteriorating fiscal position. The Congressional Budget Office’s latest forecast assumes a ten-year Treasury yield of 4.1% in 2025, falling to 3.8% by 2035. But given that the ten-year yield is already hovering around 4.5% and interest rates are expected to stay elevated, the federal deficit could expand far more quickly than previously anticipated. America’s fiscal trajectory is already unsustainable, with the CBO projecting that the federal budget deficit will increase from 6.2% of GDP in 2025 to 7.3% by 2055. Even more alarming, the debt-to-GDP ratio – currently 124.3% of GDP – could reach 156% by 2055 if current trends persist. The second source of uncertainty involves credit default swaps (CDS), which helped fuel the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Since Moody’s downgraded America’s sovereign credit rating from triple-A to Aa1 in May, the cost of insuring against a US default has risen sharply, as markets increasingly treat US government debt as a higher-risk asset. In fact, US CDS spreads now exceed those of countries with a similar credit rating, such as the United Kingdom, and are trading at levels comparable to those of Greece and Italy, both of which are rated BBB. Similarly, insuring US government debt now costs more than insuring Chinese government bonds, despite China’s lower A1 rating. A third issue is the opacity of private credit markets, which represents a long-term structural vulnerability. BlackRock predicts that private credit assets under management will more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. As more capital flows into private markets – both equity and debt – pricing becomes less transparent, making it harder for investors to value assets. The continued expansion of opaque private markets also increases the risk of leverage building up unnoticed. Much of this debt lies beyond the reach of regulatory oversight, leaving analysts and policymakers without the data needed to assess or model the true extent of systemic risk. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes. Unregulated credit markets may be especially vulnerable to cascading failures, while persistently elevated interest rates heighten the risk of default. If left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could result in widespread financial distress and job losses, ultimately triggering an economic downturn. Fourth, the relationship between the US dollar and interest rates appears to be changing. Historically, rising bond yields have supported a stronger dollar, while falling yields tended to weaken it. Since late March, however, bond yields have climbed even as the dollar has declined by 6% against the euro. This divergence suggests that global markets are repricing the premium on holding dollars and are now demanding higher returns. US stocks have also been volatile, suggesting that the repricing of risk premiums on dollar-denominated assets extends to equity markets. Rising yields reduce the value of existing bonds, signaling that Treasuries are no longer viewed as a reliable hedge against stock-market turbulence. Lastly, many Americans remain heavily exposed to equities. According to one estimate, stocks account for more than 70% of US households’ financial assets. This makes the recent surge in bond yields and the rise in economic uncertainty particularly concerning, as both developments point to fundamental shifts in market dynamics. The business leaders and investors most likely to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape will be those who grasp the far-reaching implications of economic and geopolitical trends. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes.

Title: Between the sheets glamour: Helen McAlinden on how to make your bed summer ready

Belfast native Helen McAlinden is a fan of natural fabrics, particularly in the bedroom. As a designer of the home range for Irish heritage brand Foxford for almost 20 years, she uses its new linen bedding in her own home, a sea-facing terrace in Blackrock. It comes in three stonewashed colours: a soft sunrise pink; an aqua green that is the colour of the Irish Sea; and a gentle glare-free white. It gives a look of casual ease, she says. “It’s not trying too hard but yet it looks really sophisticated. It’s light to sleep under, cool in summer and warm in winter, and you don’t need to iron it. I don’t want to iron or pay someone to iron for me.” It uses Irish flax that is woven in Guimarães, northeast of Porto in Portugal – a region known for its weaving – and dries faster than cotton. Its long fibres make it smooth to the touch and give it tensile strength, she says. “It’s also low maintenance. You just wash it and hang it out on the line.” Now you can see and touch this bedding range in the new Foxford shop in Dundrum Town Centre, as well as other outlets such as Arnotts, where Mags Fitzgibbon is the brand manager. “One thing Foxford has always had is distribution in the tourist industry, but it is more than that, it is a lifestyle brand,” says McAlinden. Indeed, its throws drape beds in ultra-luxe hotels such as Ballynahinch Castle and Ashford Castle and have found their way on to overseas hotel beds, including the Cornwall-based Hotel Tresanton, part of the Polizzi Collection. In addition to bed linen and throws, Foxford can supply almost all bedding needs, except the mattress, she says. For that she opts for a King Koil design, made in Ireland. She then layers her bed, starting with a mattress cover, made in Co Mayo for Foxford. A fitted bottom sheet is her foundation garment. Foxford’s new linen range has a generous depth of 40cm so it will fit any mattress height and stops you having to wrestle with the base to try to get the bedding over the mattress corners. She also insists on luxuriating under a top sheet, a touch that works in summer, on hot nights. Then it’s a featherlight duvet. Her main bedroom is bedecked in the aqua colourway, for it works with the warm grey of the walls, painted in Athena 858 by Benjamin Moore, and the seascapes of Dublin Bay that she can see from her home in Blackrock. The colours work with the animated greys and greens of the water breaking below. Her down duvet is Danish band Danica. “I spent €300 on it when I didn’t have €300, bought it in Copenhagen airport and carried it home as hand luggage. It’s the only thing I can sleep under.” On the nights when there’s a chill in the air, she adds a honeycomb waffle 100 per cent cotton throw, €139, also Foxford. The feather and down pillows are part of Foxford’s bedding range, made in Mayo. She opts for the empire-size, two of which will fit across her super-king bed. “It is an Irish-designed bed.” The new collection, launching in the autumn, will feature additional colours, including a denim blue, a deep inky green, a mauve and nacre, a pearlescent colour. There will also be stripes, fresh takes on toile de jouy, and contemporary checks for the Christmas market. The brand also offers a 400-thread count boxed cotton bedding set that can be customised with monogrammed embroidery or another such message, a great wedding gift to give. Easy ways to ensure your bed is well dressed, according to Mags Fitzgibbon, brand manager for Foxford at Arnotts Pillows should fit the width of the bed. If you sleep on a king-size bed buy king size pillows, which measure 50cm by 90cm instead of the standard 50cm by 75cm. This will fill in the gap in the centre of the bed. Continental pillows, 65cm squares, can be used to dress the bed. They also prop you up if you like to read or watch TV in bed. Mattress depths vary. There are about 10 different depths available. Before buying new fitted sheets, measure the depth of your mattress, to include any other layers; toppers, covers or electric blankets that will add to its height. Sales staff can then direct you to the brands that do those sizes. A flat sheet or top sheet has two purposes. It cuts down on how often you have to launder your duvet cover, and it adds a layer that feels silky to sleep under. When choosing a duvet, pick a size up from the size of the bed it will cover. Lay a king-size duvet on a double bed, for example, and so on. It gives a better look to the bed and hides part or all of the divan sides. It also gives enough cover to accommodate two people. The standard pillowcase with an inside flap, also known as the housewife, is so-called as it was developed in the 1880s by the Housewives Co-operative in Bolton to keep the pillowcase in place. Before that pillowcases were simple sleeves. Oxford pillowcases have the same internal dimensions as the housewife, but have an external edging. The pocket-springs in the Vesteroy mattress have been designed to respond independently to each other, meaning you can have a great night’s sleep regardless of whether your partner tosses and turns. The springs also allow air to circulate whilst you sleep. From €318 at ikea.ie. Rimel is a lacquered metal bedside table that comes in two colour options, the teal, pictured and a bone white. It stands 61.5cm high and has a circumference of 48cm, with a rattan top covered with tempered glass and a secret storage. €234.99 from laredoute.com. Joules Thornton king-size bedframe, €1,625, exclusive to DFS, comes in a blue stripe, floral or pink, to order. dfs.ie This velvet feather filled cushion, Fia, 40cm by 60cm, €58, also comes in 58cm squares, €75. The print will add a taste of the tropics to summer nights. harveynorman.ie This Birdie pistachio and petal coloured, frill-edged duvet cover and matching pillowcases set is a frivolous way to bring the trend for stripes into the boudoir.

However, that faulty but repairable Australian Commodore 128DCR I got last Christmas came with a big box of software and in there was a complete copy of Jane 128 along with the data disk the previous owners' family had used. They were delighted when I said I wanted to take a whack at converting their files as a thank you — and along the way we'll take a look at Jane's oddball history, the original Apple II version, the Commodore 128 version and its all-but-unknown port to the French Thomson MO5, plus those other attempts at productivity applications Commodore tried in the mid-1980s. PETs, of course, had many productivity software options and even the VIC-20, if suitably upgraded, could manage basic tasks. Some small businesses reportedly even used them for simple finances. The 64 itself was hardly an ideal productivity machine when introduced in 1982, but it was certainly far more up to the task than the VIC-20 was and many such software packages were naturally available later on. Initially, however, dealers and customers openly groused about the absence of a spreadsheet or even a word processor, much to Commodore chief Jack Tramiel's profound displeasure. The task of rectifying this situation was handed to executive Sigmund Hartmann and his recently consolidated Commodore Software division, formed in April 1983 from the prior two separate software units handling system software (under Paul Goheen) and games (under Bill Wade). At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team. C1541 is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions. c1541 #8> dir 0 "data#000 " 01 2a 39 "c.TESTCALC" prg 3 "l.TESTLIST" prg 4 "w.nOTE.2" prg 4 "w.TESTCONV" prg 1278 blocks free. c1541 #8> read "w.TESTCONV" ERR = 62, FILE NOT FOUND, 00, 00 cannot read `w.TESTCONV' on unit 8 invalid filename As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them.

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

'{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Fortunately it doesn't look like the bad sector was in any of the files they cared about. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Cardfiles are stored much more efficiently. Here's the entirety of our two cards. The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting.

For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent.

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that.

With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete.

Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway.

The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well.

RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later.

It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market.

Good read as always. I didn't have any fancy software like Jane, I used (a pirated copy of) Bank Street Writer. I used Bank Street Writer on the Apple IIe in school, and we did have a (legal :-D ) copy for the Commodore 64, but I rapidly outgrew it. It did its job teaching me how to use one, though, so I remember it fondly. Comments are subject to moderation. Be nice. Comments are subject to moderation. Be nice.

Title: Narwal Freo Z10 Robot Vacuum — Australian Review
URL: https://ausdroid.net/news/review/2025/06/22/narwal-freo-z10-robot-vacuum-australian-review/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T23:41:12Z
Full Content:
I’m lazy. I quite like doing as little as possible that resembles a “chore”, and yet, I enjoy living in a nice, clean, tidy space. You might think these two attributes are at odds with each other, and in a way, they are … however not entirely. Even a lazy person can have a moderately clean space with a little bit of help, and that’s precisely what Narwal’s Freo Z10 robot vacuum offers me. A little bit of help… and it goes a long way. In a nutshell, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a robot vacuum and mop system. Superficially, it presents the same aesthetic that robot vacuums have since their inception – little round discs that float around your house, vacuuming up dust, hair, crumbs and whatever else. However, there are some marked differences between the Freo Z10 and most other robot vacuums I’ve seen, and they really set it apart. For starters: This last point is one I’d like to dwell on. Anyone – and I do mean anyone – who’s had a robot vac or a Dyson stick vac or anything similar, anything with a roller, knows what an absolutely disgusting job it is to remove hair from the roller brush. Even if there are no people with long hair in your house, somehow, your vacuum will get gummed up with long hair within a few days and removing it is gross. Sometimes it comes away easily, other times you need a knife or scissors to pry it off. With Freo Z10’s DualFlow Tangle Free System, you can literally forget about this. Its three-step system will remove the long hair from your place every time, and you’ll never have to cut it out of your vacuum. Its clever sweeper arms can fold into different shapes when it detects a hair tangle, and it spins them down to the roller which effortlessly sucks the hair off and into the dustbin. I think the thing that I like the most is that, for the most part, I don’t have to think about or see the Freo Z10, whether it’s working or resting. When its resting, it’s quiet and out of the way.. yes it takes up a bit of space in my laundry, but I can close the door, and that’s done. I just have to make sure the door’s open before I leave for work in the morning, and Freo Z10 can get to work. When its working, it’s quiet, deftly avoids most obstacles (though it can get caught up on mobile phone charger cables) and works quickly. It can mop and vacuum my entire apartment in an hour or two, and it’s so quiet that I don’t usually hear it should I happen to be working from home… unless of course it decides to vacuum under my feet. Yes, I don’t let it go into the kids bedroom, because they’re pathologically incapable of picking up socks, cables, toys, and whatnot, and I don’t really want my house clean to be interrupted by the Freo Z10 getting trapped in there before it’s finished everything else. It’s great in the kitchen, too – it vacuums first, then comes back to mop after on its usual program (which you can customise as you see fit), but it’s good for cleaning up ad-hoc messes too. The other day I spilled a coffee in the kitchen, and while I picked up the big bits of the broken cup, there were little shards of ceramic everywhere, as well as most of the contents. Freo Z10 went to work, and while it vacuumed first – and cleaned up all the shards – it did mean it drove through the coffee and I was a little concerned it might wheel coffee tracks over the carpet to get back to its base station. I’m not exactly sure how, but it this didn’t eventuate – the mop pads definitely were a bit brown, but it lifted them out of the way to drive over the carpet, cleaned itself, came back and finished the job. With no intervention whatsoever – besides picking up the larger ceramic pieces that you’d never vacuum anyway – my kitchen was returned to a sparkling clean state within ten minutes. So, too, were Freo Z10’s mop pads – the base station has a deep wash cycle after each mopping exercise, which rinses, washes, and then dries the mop pads. The downside is that it gets through a bit of water to do this, and the grey water tank needs emptying after three or four cycles, but the plus side is a functional mop every time, no stinky wet-mop smell, and a clean house. Can’t complain. Not a great deal. The elephant in the room is the price – Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 at the time of writing, down from its launch price of $1,999. It remains quite expensive, though, and there are definitely more affordable options on the market. However, it is a case of getting what you pay for, and with the Freo Z10, you get all the bells and whistles. It’s a top class vacuum. When I say you get all the bells and whistles, though, there are a couple missing. Yes, Freo Z10 integrates with your choice of voice assistant from Google, Amazon or Apple .. but the integration isn’t amazing. I had a few goes with Alexa and found that it generally didn’t work all that well – after pairing, it seemed reluctant to actually work, though this might’ve been more Alexa’s shortcoming than anything else. It pairs to Google Home, too, but it seems that when its paired with Alexa, you can’t pair it with anything else, which is a bit limiting if you happen to use both. It doesn’t integrate with Home Assistant, and Narwal’s developers have (according to discussion on Reddit) declined to make that possible in future, which smart home aficionados might be a little upset about. As much as I’d love this feature, it’s easy enough to run Freo Z10 on a schedule, and the phone app makes it easy to schedule ad-hoc tasks. The obstacle detection is really good – probably among the best in class – but even still, Freo Z10 manages to get caught up. Twice I’ve found it with a mouthful of my USB-C phone charger, once it ate my daughter’s swimming bag, and it chowed down on a hairbrush (??) one day. However, these were minor things and easily adjusted to avoid future problems, and in the last week, there’s been no jams or anything. Yes.. you do have to clean up a bit for your cleaner, the cliche holds true. Yes. Probably the only reasons you’d think otherwise is the cost, if you don’t have room for what isn’t the smallest base station around, or if you’ve already got a decent robot vacuum. Otherwise, for the lazy homekeeper, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a welcome addition and will reduce your household chores significantly. Yes, it can’t clean your toilets or scrub your shower down, but it can vacuum, mop and sweep, freeing you up for those less pleasant jobs. Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 and you can buy it online from Narwal Australia, Amazon (with delivery in a couple of days), or you can find it in-store at Costco nationwide, Good Guys, and JB HiFi (though not all retailers have actual stock, it might be more a delivery thing). However you get one, we recommend that you do, and you won’t be sorry.

Title: What to expect when (or if) Elon Musk launches a Tesla robotaxi service

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising self-driving cars for a decade, and the moment of truth may finally be here. Musk, who’s mostly back in the private sector after his chain saw-wielding turn in the Trump administration, has said that Tesla plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on Sunday. Though he said the exact day could still shift, Tesla appears to be getting close to making an attempt, with videos spreading online of road tests where no human is in the driver’s seat. But Tesla is also starting from behind. Waymo, a spinoff of Google, is already running a robotaxi service in several cities including Austin, and the service has a growing following. Safety remains a key question. Musk has rejected the idea of using radar and lidar sensors on Tesla vehicles, instead relying on cameras in a departure from some rivals. He has said the Tesla robotaxis are using a “new version of software” that’s relatively untested. Federal regulators have been raising concerns about Tesla’s driver-assistance software for more than a year, saying it contributed to hundreds of avoidable crashes, including some fatal crashes. Waymo’s service has not reported any fatalities. Here’s what to expect from Tesla’s planned service. Musk said this month that the robotaxi launch would be, “Tentatively, June 22.” Musk has predicted for years that autonomous Tesla vehicles were just around the corner, to the point where it’s become a meme. Musk told Fortune magazine in 2015 that autonomy was two years away, and he said in 2019 that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the roads in 2020. Texas Democrats on Wednesday asked Tesla to delay its launch until September, when a new state law could take effect and require robotaxi operators to obtain a state permit. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Very few people, at least to start. Musk has said that the service will begin very small, with as few as 10 vehicles the first week. They’ll operate in Austin, but Tesla hasn’t said how large its service area will be. There is no public waitlist, although Musk has said he wants to grow the service within a few months to catch up to Waymo. On Friday, some people on Musk’s social media app X posted screenshots of what appeared to be invitations to “early access of Tesla Robotaxi.” Robotaxi services work like a Lyft or Uber ride-hail service: A user orders a ride on a phone app by entering their starting point and destination. The key difference is that there’s no one in the driver’s seat, although it’s not clear whether Tesla will have someone in the front passenger seat, as it has during test drives, or how much remote control of the car Tesla will have. Waymo says its service covers 37 square miles in Austin, and customers there can order rides through the Uber app, in a partnership between the two tech companies. Waymo is also available in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco and Atlanta, with plans to expand to Miami and elsewhere. Nationwide, Waymo says it has 1,500 vehicles on the road, plus parking lots, electric charging stations, maintenance staff and engineers to support the vehicles. “Waymo is far and away the leader of the development of the technology here, and over the last 15 years has been evolving both the technology and related infrastructure to support what they’re doing,” said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Transportation and Logistics. Tesla is calling its service Robotaxi, but so far the company has not succeeded in getting a trademark for the term. Experts say that no one knows how safe Tesla’s service will be. “I’m glad they’re starting small,” said Greg Stevens, the research director of Mcity, a testing lab for autonomous technology at the University of Michigan. “As an engineer, I’m a real fan of small launches. Keep it simple in the beginning: launch a small number of vehicles and watch them very, very closely,” he said. Phil Koopman, an associate professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said that only a driving record over tens of millions of miles will determine Tesla’s safety. “Success is no crashes and no serious mishaps for the rest of the year, at least,” he said. “Safety is not something where you can go look at the car and see that it’s safe.” Tesla has a different approach to safety than its chief competitor. While Waymo uses a combination of cameras, radar and lidar to keep its bearings, Tesla relies on cameras only. It’s an approach that Musk says is less expensive and “superior” to using lidar, while federal regulators have said that Tesla’s cameras may have trouble seeing in certain conditions such as fog and glaring sun. Musk has said that Tesla is “being super paranoid about safety.” He has also said a more advanced version of Tesla’s autonomy software “still requires a lot of polishing.” Texas has had relatively permissive laws about autonomous vehicles: Unlike in California, there’s no state regulator in Texas that needs to sign off on the service. That may change in September, when a proposed Texas law requiring robotaxi operators to get authorization from the Department of Motor Vehicles is set to take effect. The bill has passed the state House and Senate and is awaiting action by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. If Tesla launches Sunday and Abbott signs the bill into law, it’s not clear what would happen under the new law this fall. A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles said Friday that the department would need time to put the law into effect and begin enforcement, a process that would most likely stretch into next year. Austin city officials also say they’re prohibited under state law from regulating autonomous vehicles, but they have been documenting examples of safety concerns. In the first five months of this year, the city said it collected data on 35 safety incidents, such as blocking traffic, involving various companies. Austin officials said that as of Friday, they had not documented any safety incidents involving Tesla autonomous vehicles. “The City treats each AV company that expresses interest in Austin the same, offering training opportunities and providing information about City right-of-way and procedure,” Jack Flagler, a spokesperson for the Austin transportation department, said in an email. He said the city had provided Tesla and others with maps, special event information and information about fire and police procedures. Tesla has sought to block the city of Austin from releasing government records about its planned service, according to Reuters. Tesla has not publicly outlined any contingency plans, but if rival companies are a guide, Tesla will have staff ready to assist either in person or remotely. Test vehicles spotted in Austin have been followed close behind by what some people speculate to be “trailing” vehicles driven by humans. Companies such as Waymo and the now-defunct Cruise say they can and do intervene remotely with vehicles if there’s a problem — which for Cruise meant every 4 to 5 miles, according to CNBC. Cruise later shut down following a highly publicized crash involving a pedestrian. Tesla posted a job related to teleoperations and told Wall Street analysts to expect telesupport, according to Wired magazine and auto site Electrek, but the company hasn’t provided details. The stakes are high for the whole robotaxi industry. “That’s my big worry: that all the progress we’ve made gets halted by some sort of major safety incident,” Stevens said. Musk has said that safety and regulations will guide how quickly Tesla tries to expand the number of vehicles in the service. He told CNBC in an interview last month: “I think we’ll probably be at a thousand within a few months.” He also mentioned expanding to California, though Tesla does not have the permit required to operate there. Musk has also hyped a new vehicle, called Cybercab, that Tesla could potentially use for its robotaxi service, though for now the company is using existing model vehicles. And eventually, Musk has said that individual Tesla owners would be able to offer their vehicles for hire in the robotaxi service, but he has not set a date for when that might happen. “How long did it take Waymo to scale up? Years and years and years. And there’s no reason to believe it will be different for Tesla,” Koopman said. The scheduled launch of the robotaxi service has helped to buoy Tesla’s stock price in recent months, after the company’s sales and profits cratered during Musk’s time in the Trump administration and the resulting “Tesla Takedown” protests against him and the company. Some investors think Tesla will be able to scale up its service quickly to dozens of cities over the next year, creating a new source of revenue while possibly also boosting vehicle sales. Some experts think that is the main point of the robotaxi launch. “I think the objective that is paramount is stabilizing Tesla’s stock price,” said MIT’s Reimer. “This is as much of a media stunt as anything else.” David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN paid to a 15-year-old boy from Dundalk who died by drowning after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. The boy has been named locally as Kofi Owusu, from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said that the school is heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He told RTÉ News Kofi was a “fine young man, very kind, a very caring and a very diligent student.” Sharkey added that supports will be put in place for students and staff within the school community at this difficult time. The school posted a statement to social media which said that Kofi was a “very caring young man with a wide circle of friends” and an “accomplished sportsman”. Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He had finished his Junior Cert exams just ten days ago. Advertisement Junior Minister Thomas Byrne has said he was devastated to hear of Kofi’s death. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss. “Thank you to the Coast Guard teams, emergency services, and local volunteers who responded. “Please respect the family’s privacy and Gardai have asked to avoid sharing any images or details online,” he said. Local councillor in Laytown Carol Lennon told The Journal that the community is in shock following the tragic incident. “Kids jump off that bridge every year, and I suppose no group thinks the worst is going to happen, and yesterday it did. Someone had actually raised safety concerns about jumping off the bridge during the week in the town, and now this has happened three days later, it is just awful. “Everyone is thinking about the boy’s friends and family at this terrible time. “We need more affordable access to swimming lessons, and better water safety education through schools so children know what to do when it comes to public waterways, and also what the best thing to do is if someone you are with gets into difficulty, or if you yourself get into difficulty. There is basic knowledge there that we need to share, because it saves lives. “Unfortunately in this case it’s too late. This was a tragic, awful accident and support will be needed for the other boys who were there and witnessed this, who have lost their friend and been through something traumatic,” she said.

Tributes have been paid to a teenage boy who died while swimming near a Co Meath beach yesterday afternoon. The teen has been named locally as Kofi Owusu (15) from Blackrock, outside Dundalk in Co Louth. The teenager tragically died after he got into difficulty swimming in the water under the footbridge in the River Nanny near Laytown beach. It is understood that Kofi, who was with a group of friends at the time of the incident, was visiting Laytown on Friday for a day out at the beach. His body was recovered from the water by the coastguard and his remains were taken to Our Lady's Hospital in Navan where a post mortem will take place. He was a student of Coláiste Chú Chulainn and a talented soccer player, he played for Redeemer Celtic FC in Dundalk. Gardaí say they are aware of videos of this incident that are currently in circulation and are requesting footage and imagery not to be shared. In a tribute, the school said: “This is a terrible tragedy for Kofi’s family and friends, the Coláiste Chú Chulainn community and the local community of Dundalk and the surrounding areas, who are deeply saddened by this event. “Kofi Owusu completed his Junior Certificate in Coláiste Chú Chulainn in June 2025. “Kofi was a very caring young man with a wide circle of friends. He was a diligent student and a regular awardee for excellent attendance. Kofi was also an accomplished sportsman. He was a member of the school’s under 15 soccer team and represented the school in the recent Leinster Shield final on the 19th May 2025. "Kofi was also a member of the school’s under 16 basketball team and represented the school in the All Ireland final on the 23rd January 2025. "Our sympathy and thoughts are with Kofi’s family and friends at this time.” The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department of Education and Youth have been in contact with the school and will be supporting and advising staff iin their efforts to assist our students. Redeemer Celtic shared a touching tribute to Kofi on social media, showing two of his number 6 jerseys laid down on a soccer pitch alongside a bouquet of flowers, with the caption: “We are heartbroken. Closed until further notice.” An outpouring of tributes from members of the Dundalk community was shared underneath the post. As a mark of respect, local soccer club Laytown United FC announced it had postponed a planned end of season presentation day scheduled for Saturday. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this heartbreaking incident,” the club said in a statement on Facebook. “We appreciate your understanding. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.” Meanwhile, this is the second teenager that has been confirmed dead in two separate swimming tragedies as temperatures remain high across the country. Peter Byrne (17) tragically died after getting into difficulty while swimming in the River Barrow in Co Carlow on Tuesday. The late Peter Byrne. Photo: RIP.ie Separately in Co Dublin, four teenagers were injured after getting into difficulty in the water in two separate incidents in Howth. The Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. Kofi Owusu, aged 15, from Dundalk died after getting into difficulty while swimming at Laytown on Friday evening Today's News in 90 seconds - 21st June 2025 Condolences have been offered to the family of Kofi Owusu for their “devastating loss”, local representatives said. Minister of State and Meath East TD Thomas Byrne said it was “devastating to hear of the tragic death of a teenage boy” in Laytown. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving,” he said on X. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss.” Cathaoirleach of Meath County Council Wayne Harding said: "A young boy has lost his life tragically off our coast this weekend. My thoughts are with his devastated family at this time. "I want to thank all those who responded to the tragedy both in a professional and voluntary capacity. I ask that we be extremely vigilant to the dangers all our water courses pose during these good weather spells." Local East Meath Cllr Carol Lennon said: "The loss of life in tragic circumstances is devastating and we, as a community want to offer our sincere condolences to the families of the boys involved in the tragedy that occurred in the River Nanny on Friday night. “What started as a great summer's day ended with the loss of a young life, a teen, enjoying the first tasters of Summer of 2025. "I would personally like to thank the emergency services who attended so fast and showed great compassion to the friends and families at the scene”. Councillor Sharon Tolan said “a dark cloud” was hanging over the community on Friday night. “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the tragic accident in Laytown,” she said on Facebook. “Please think long and hard before posting any commentary on any social media pages.” Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. In a statement shared on social media, the Coast Guard urged the public to take precautions and said rip currents “are the leading surf hazard for all beachgoers". Rips are described as strong currents “that start near the shore and rush out seaward, quickly taking you out of your comfort zone, from the shallows to deeper water.” If caught in a rip current, the advice from the Coast Guard is to remain calm and swim out of the current in a direction following the shoreline. According to the Coast Guard, rip currents “typically form at low sports or breaks in sandbars, and also near structures such as groynes, jetties and piers.” Meanwhile, the funeral of teenager Peter Byrne (17) who died swimming in Milford, Co Carlow will take place on Monday. Mr Byrne was swimming with two of his friends when he got into difficulty. The young man's body was recovered at 11.30pm Tuesday night by divers from the Garda Water Unit within a 10 metre radius of where he was last seen. "It is with a very heavy and broken heart that we share the devastating news of the passing of our much beloved youths player Peter Byrne who tragically passed away this week,” read a statement from New Oak F.C. "Peter was a pocket rocket in the team over the last number of years. Small in stature but big in personality. He was a huge character with a touch of Roy Keane about him, not afraid of anything or anyone. "Peter was the life and soul of the dressing room and training and will be sadly missed by his coaches Ernie, Danny and all his teammates who have not only lost a fellow player but a friend. "On behalf of everyone at New Oak F.C we would like to offer our deepest condolences to Peter’s family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with all who loved him. May Peter’s gentle soul rest in peace.” In Dublin, the Howth RNLI volunteer crew were involved in a multi-agency response to two cliff rescues off the coast of Howth, North Co Dublin, on Thursday afternoon. They received reports of three children cut off by the tide near Lion's Head, which is a popular swimming spot on the south side of the Howth peninsula, close to the Bailey Lighthouse. The injured teenager is winched to safety by Rescue Helicopter 116. Photo: Howth RNLI Shortly before 4.30pm, the inshore lifeboat was launched by the RNLI, with three crew on board, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard Unit and Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116, who quickly made their way to the scene amid moderate sea conditions. Two teenagers, who were stranded on the cliff, were located by the Howth Coast Guard cliff team. As the team tried to recover one of the injured teenagers, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin, which coordinated the rescue, asked the lifeboat crew to remain on standby. While on scene, the lifeboat was diverted to a separate emergency nearby where a teenager had fallen from cliffs at White Water Brook, a remote beach below cliffs on the eastern side of the peninsula. Howth RNLI crew member climbs onto rocks at the base of cliffs in Howth. Photo: Howth RNLI The lifeboat crew were directed by beachgoers to a teenager, who had fallen approximately six metres onto rocks at the water’s edge, sustaining multiple lacerations and suspected fractures. A second teenager had swum to assist him and was holding him steady on a rock when the lifeboat arrived at the scene. The lifeboat crew made their way across rocks to assess the injured teen, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard and Howth All-Weather lifeboat. However, due to the swiftly rising tide, the injured teen needed to be immediately evacuated by a helicopter. The Rescue 116 deployed its winchman, who assessed the teen’s injuries and secured him in a rescue harness, winching them both to safety. The second teenager was showing the signs of hypothermia and was assisted across the rocks and brought aboard the inshore life boat. He was later transferred to the lifeboat and taken to Howth Lifeboat Station, where he was handed into the care of an ambulance crew and transported to the hospital. Helm of the inshore lifeboat, Killian O’Reilly, said: “This was a challenging afternoon with two serious incidents in quick succession, both in difficult, rocky locations.” "On a sunny summer’s day, it’s easy to underestimate the risks around the coastline – but the sea and cliffs can be unforgiving. "The teamwork shown between the RNLI, Coast Guard units, and Rescue 116 was exceptional and ensured the best possible outcome in tough circumstances,” he added. He urged the public to be aware of the dangers and know what to do where they might find themselves in difficulty in the water, especially during this spell of hot weather. “Air temperatures may feel warm, but water temperatures are cold enough year-round to trigger cold-water shock. If you get into difficulty, remember float to live: tilt your head back, with your ears submerged. Relax and try to breathe normally. "Move your hands and legs to help you stay afloat. Once you've regained control of your breathing, you can call for help or swim to safety,” he added. The members of the public are advised to call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coast Guard if they or someone else gets into difficulty near the coast.

Artificial intelligence is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The job of the future might already be past its prime. For years, young people seeking a lucrative career were urged to go all in on computer science. From 2005 to 2023, the number of comp-sci majors in the United States quadrupled. All of which makes the latest batch of numbers so startling. This year, enrollment grew by only 0.2 percent nationally, and at many programs, it appears to already be in decline, according to interviews with professors and department chairs. At Stanford, widely considered one of the country’s top programs, the number of comp-sci majors has stalled after years of blistering growth. Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the chair of Princeton’s computer-science department, told me that, if current trends hold, the cohort of graduating comp-sci majors at Princeton is set to be 25 percent smaller in two years than it is today. The number of Duke students enrolled in introductory computer-science courses has dropped about 20 percent over the past year. But if the decline is surprising, the reason for it is fairly straightforward: Young people are responding to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders. In recent years, the tech industry has been roiled by layoffs and hiring freezes. The leading culprit for the slowdown is technology itself. Artificial intelligence has proved to be even more valuable as a writer of computer code than as a writer of words. This means it is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. A recent Pew study found that Americans think software engineers will be most affected by generative AI. Many young people aren’t waiting to find out whether that’s true. “It’s so counterintuitive,” Molly Kinder, a Brookings Institution fellow who studies AI’s effect on the economy, told me. “This was supposed to be the job of the future. The way to stay ahead of technology was to go to college and get coding skills.” But the days of “Learn to code” might be coming to an end. If the numbers are any indication, we might have passed peak computer science. Chris Gropp, a doctoral student at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, has spent eight months searching for a job. He triple-majored in computer science, math, and computational science at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and has completed the coursework for a computer-science Ph.D. He would prefer to work instead of finishing his degree, but he has found it almost impossible to secure a job. He knows of only two people who recently pulled it off. One sent personalized cover letters for 40 different roles and set up meetings with people at the companies. The other submitted 600 applications. “We’re in an AI revolution, and I am a specialist in the kind of AI that we’re doing the revolution with, and I can’t find anything,” Gropp told me. “I found myself a month or two ago considering, Do I just take a break from this thing that I’ve been training for for most of my life and go be an apprentice electrician?” Gropp is contending with a weak job market for recent college graduates in general and the tech sector in particular. Although employment for 22-to-27-year-olds in other fields has grown slightly over the past three years, employment for computer-science and math jobs in that age group has fallen by 8 percent. Not long ago, graduates from top comp-sci programs—such as those at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon—would have been fending off recruiters from Google and Amazon. Now, professors at those schools told me, their graduates are having to try much harder to find work. Gropp’s dad, William Gropp, runs the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “I can say, as the father of a computer-science master’s degree holder with expertise in machine learning who is still looking for a job, that the industry is not what it used to be,” he told me. In the ultimate irony, candidates like Gropp might be unable to get jobs working on AI because AI itself is taking the jobs. “We know AI is affecting jobs,” Rusinkiewicz, from Princeton, told me. “It’s making people more efficient at some or many aspects of their jobs, and therefore, perhaps companies feel they can get away with doing a bit less hiring.” Derek Thompson: Something alarming is happening to the job market The best evidence that artificial intelligence is displacing tech workers comes from the fact that the industry that has most thoroughly integrated AI is the one with such unusually high unemployment. Tech leaders have said publicly that they no longer need as many entry-level coders. Executives at Alphabet and Microsoft have said that AI writes or assists with writing upwards of 25 percent of their code. (Microsoft recently laid off 6,000 workers.) Anthropic’s chief product officer recently told The New York Times that senior engineers are giving work to the company’s chatbot instead of a low-level human employee. The company’s CEO has warned that AI could replace half of all entry-level workers in the next five years. Kinder, the Brookings fellow, said she worries that companies soon will simply eliminate the entire bottom rung of the career ladder. The plight of the tech grads, she told me, could be a warning for all entry-level white-collar workers. Not everyone agrees that AI is causing the turbulence in the job market. The tech industry frequently goes through booms and busts. The biggest companies exploded in size when the economy was good. Now, with high interest rates and the specter of new tariffs, executives are likely holding off on expanding, and workers are reluctant to leave their job, says Zack Mabel, director of research at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Companies have an incentive to blame layoffs on AI instead of forces within their control, David Deming, an economics professor at Harvard, told me. “Before we see big changes from AI in the labor market, companies have to internalize this new capability and change what they ask for. And that’s the thing that I have not seen very much of,” he said. “It could be AI, but we just don’t know.” Enrollment in the computer-science major has historically fluctuated with the job market. When jobs are scarce, people choose to study something else. Eventually, there aren’t enough computer-science graduates, salaries go up, and more people are drawn in. Prior declines have always rebounded to enrollment levels higher than where they started. (And some universities, such as the University of Chicago, still haven’t seen any enrollment drops.) Sam Madden, a computer-science professor at MIT, told me that even if companies are employing generative AI, that will likely create more demand for software engineers, not less. Read: Silicon Valley braces for chaos Whether the past few years augur a temporary lull or an abrupt reordering of working life, economists suggest the same response for college students: Major in a subject that offers enduring, transferable skills. Believe it or not, that could be the liberal arts. Deming’s research shows that male history and social-science majors end up out-earning their engineering and comp-sci counterparts in the long term, as they develop the soft skills that employers consistently seek out. “It’s actually quite risky to go to school to learn a trade or a particular skill, because you don’t know what the future holds,” Deming told me. “You need to try to think about acquiring a skill set that’s going to be future-proof and last you for 45 years of working life.” Of course, when faced with enormous uncertainty, many young people take the opposite approach and pursue something with a sure path to immediate employment. The question of the day is how many of those paths AI will soon foreclose.

Title: Weekend reading: A content-rich resource for investors, and a call for TA 2.0

What caught my eye this week. With AI chatbots and search overviews now vigorously putting the boot into an online media that was already on its knees, quality independent websites covering investing and money are shrinking faster than violets at an OnlyFans convention. Good news then that the curation site Snippet Finance has started maintaining a content hub for investors, with links to all kinds of resources. You’ll find a few Weekend Reading favourites in its listings. But there’s plenty of other lesser-seen websites, tools, and other useful stuff to explore, especially if you’re a professional or dedicated amateur finance nerd. Be sure to check out Snippet Finance itself. Creator Yuri is the Hemmingway of investment editorial. This introduction is twice as long as a typical Snippet post. Incidentally, I just dived into the Monevator vaults to find a similar listing I ran early in the life of this website. Of the blogs I tracked, only us, Mr Money Mustache, Financial Samurai, and Simple Living in Somerset (renamed) are still standing. Talking of the bonfire of the blogosphere, any investing maniac starting today who wants to talk about their favourite subject online – doubtless having been banned from doing so by exhausted family and friends – would probably have to gurn into an iPhone to create videos for YouTube or TikTok. Maybe that’s you – but then again maybe you’re more a great one for a witty adverb, rather than the next Mr Beast? If so then Monevator would benefit from a new and brilliant regular writer. We’ve had several over the years, but somehow they never last. Often they discover they haven’t got as much to say about FIRE, personal finance, or index funds as they thought they did after the third article. Most just can’t write the Monevator way. (It’s not so hard. Take the day off and yet still be at it at midnight. Never use two words when three will do. Add some obscure references to 1980s music and 1990s video games and you’re all set!) Honestly it probably won’t work out with you either. But I’d still love to hear from you if you’ve got a lot to share. Ideally you’ll be more towards the start of your journey than we are. Not phobic about smartphones and investing apps. Maybe you even bought an NFT of a cartoon gorilla during the 2021 crypto mania before repenting your foolish ways. But mainly you’ll be on-message with sensible investing. A bit of personal finance hackery – stoozing, credit card rewards, current account bonus chasing – wouldn’t hurt either. (It all adds up in your 20s.) We’d want a bit of personality in the mix. Judicious. Tasteful. Nothing too influencer-y. Can you point me to a bit of writing you did earlier? Brilliant. Get in touch via the Contact form if you’re the person all your friends go to about investing. Just so long as you write better than ChatGPT, and without it too.

Mashing up Gibson’s Necromancer (introducing Chatsubo’s bartender), in a world of affordable manufactured niche fintwit and financial micro franchises on X, Reddit and Substack, there’s something almost heraldic about sticking your neck out (and opening your wallet) to run a defiantly indie full service Website (remember those 😉 ) covering the gambit of UK related PF, FIRE and investing. Very 1990s/Gen X 🙂 Luv it. Long may you continue. Good luck finding a new contributing author. The root problem surely remains that FIRE, or pursuit of FI, for the vast majority of people boils down to earning more, spending less and stashing (MMM influence?) the surplus. How to string that out week after week is a challenge. As you wrote yourself we can all manage an article or three, probably based on our own habits, but to have the curiosity to keep seeking new opportunities is rare. I am always in awe of how people like Ermine find the inspiration to both keep going and maintain the quality. In my office I am the boring bloke that people approach every September when asked to submit their choices for the flexible part of our total compensation for the year ahead. That might make an interesting paragraph or three for those at my firm, but after that the well dries up.

On a minor point, and I’m not grouching about compounding – > It all adds up in your 20s [stoozing et al. Is that really still a thing?] What really adds up in your 20s IMO is the muppetry you don’t do that your peers do. Primum non nocere. And this Good luck with the search! Hi I’ve been receiving your newsletter for many years, always looking forward to the interesting content and links. But since you’ve tried to monetise the site, the free content has become very week. Probably best to scrap it and concentrate on subscription. Interesting pieces by Swedroe/Alpha Architect and AQR. Problem is neither of AA nor AQR actually offer up any ISA/SIPP friendly, non-exorbitatant products to tap their research. Loved these from Snippet Finance “1984.. energy..made up 27% of S&P 500 earnings, today…1%”, cost of urban 1km tunnel in NY $4 bn, Paris $230 mn, and S. Korea $100 mn. Perhaps these explain why energy/commodities so underowned as a diversifier (despite mean reversion potential of being the worst performing asset class from 2011) and why UK/US infra ITs’/CEFs’ woes seem worse than you’d expect even given high rates. Nice set of links – thanks. Blanchett paper chimes with observations I have made @M (& elsewhere) over the last year or so. Interesting! I think it’s hard to get a younger contributor with the confidence to blog to an audience such as Monevator. There are lots of commenters who are deep into technicalities, strategies and picking of individual funds etc which can be somewhat intimidating, nevermind the suspicion that people are playing with a lot more capital than most 20-30 somethings will have amassed (notwithstanding City bonuses and tech stock options). Plus I suspect the audience may have a certain scepticism around those who have never been burnt by their own past poor decisions or inertia/inaction. However the FIREside chat format works well so having more volunteers in that space would be more than possible.

Title: Digital Asset Revolution – How Blockchain Is Turning Real-World Assets Digital
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/20/digital-asset-revolution-how-blockchain-is-turning-real-world-assets-digital/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T03:40:59Z
Full Content:
The combination of established finance and blockchain technology opens up different opportunities for asset ownership, liquidity and worldwide access. The economic environment is experiencing a paradigm shift as the migration of RWAs (real-world assets) onto blockchain networks is exemplified by creating digital representations of real, tangible value, including the ability to be traded, fractioned and accessed worldwide. This transition is not a mere case of technological innovation. Still, it can be considered a recasting of our worldview of ownership, liquidity and financial inclusion in this digital era. The tokenization revolution gains momentum Real estate asset tokenization has progressed from a speculative idea to a multi-billion-dollar global capability. Among the over $250 billion of tokenized assets, Ethereum holds about 55% of the market share and settles itself as the leading infrastructural platform of this digital transformation. That will include US Treasuries, real estate, commodities and intellectual property. The gains in this movement are charging at a fast pace. Assets such as real estate, treasuries and others are now being converted to liquid on the blockchain, which has over 18 billion in market value, and the prospects of it growing huge in the future. In the industry, it is anticipated that even greater growth will be evident in the future, considering that the market of tokenized assets, such as stablecoins, is currently forecasted to increase to 18.9 trillion in the year 2033, as suggested by a study by Ripple and BCG. Busting the conventional boundaries The idea of tokenizing assets is so popular because it helps to address the essential inefficiencies of conventional financial markets. Traditional asset ownership usually involves large down payment requirements, complicated intermediaries and statement periods. Tokenization resolves these concerns since this technology generates digital tokens reflecting fractional ownership of physical, real-world assets. Think of real estate – one of the most illiquid asset classes. With tokenization, commercial real estate valued in millions of dollars may be separated into thousands of digital tokens, each reflecting a minute share of ownership. Shareholders can buy these tokens at a much smaller financial outlay, sell them off on the secondary market, earn an equivalent fractional rent of the underlying property and have exposure to genuine property appreciation. This partial ownership is in no way limited to real estate. Art collections, vintage wines, precious metals (such as gold) and even income streams around intellectual property can be tokenized, enabling access to these investments to a broader pool than ever before. Thus, the investment process previously open only to institutional investors and the super-rich can be democratized. The technology foundation Asset tokenization is based on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts whose terms are encoded directly into code. Such digital contracts automate several processes that have been handled by intermediaries up until now, such as the distribution of dividends or compliance checks. Embedding coded rules in digital tokens and the ability to observe and be linked to RWAs may result in financial tools enabling automatic compliance, capital calls and distributions, making more efficient end-to-end fund products. The blockchain platform on which such tokens run offers several essential benefits. Growth is institutionally adopted The tokenization sector gained considerable credibility with the arrival of large financial companies. BlackRock announced its tokenized fund in March 2024, and asset giants like Franklin Templeton have launched their tokenization plans. This institutional legitimization has fueled the adoption and made the space legitimate in the eyes of traditional investors. The use of tokenization in financial assets should continue expanding in 2025 as a concept and an implementation, as adoption among large banks and asset managers is already bearing fruit. These institutions’ participation contributes capital, regulatory know-how and operational infrastructure that needs to be adopted to get mainstream. The development of regulation and local dominance The global regulatory environment regarding tokenized assets is changing quickly, and various jurisdictions are approaching oversight and compliance differently. Increased regulatory sandboxes and similar programs will enable the permissible growth of tokenization use cases among financial institutions, with more nations in APAC remaining at the forefront. These sandbox regulatory places offer a controlled platform for financial companies to experiment with tokenization solutions. They closely collaborate with regulators to establish documented frameworks. This joint plan aids in balancing innovativeness, investor protection and financial stability. Nevertheless, there are still issues like regulation. The regulation of asset tokenization involves a serious debate between the necessity of data privacy and the transparency of blockchain technology. Moreover, in most jurisdictions, the legal maturity of smart contracts is unassured, putting tokenization ventures into question. Conquering challenges of implementation Although asset tokenization has excellent potential, it also has various practical challenges that should be overcome to be readily adopted. Success stories and acquisitions Asset tokenization is gaining ground in various sectors in the following areas. The way to the future In 2025, tokenized assets will coexist with traditional instruments, and combining innovations with tradition will generate specific hybrid models to ensure that the world of financial markets is faster, more transparent and accessible to more people. This hybrid scheme can be gradually adopted with enough consideration for traditional investors and regulators. Coupling the sale of tokenized assets with existing financial infrastructure opens up a massive opportunity for market players. Banks can implement new products and services, asset managers reach a wider audience of investors and portfolio diversification becomes feasible using access to new assets previously unattainable to an individual investor. Yet, it will be successful, provided it can overcome some of the present issues regarding the integration of technologies, clarity of regulations and market development. Companies that can afford to implement adequate infrastructure, maintain a proper compliance framework, and concentrate on the user experience will be in the best place to utilize the transformation. Conclusion RWA tokenization is a monumental change in conceptualizing ownership and value transfer in the digital economy. This innovation uses blockchain technology to provide digital versions of physical and financial assets, enabling the democratization of investment opportunities, increased market efficiency and new opportunities for institutional and retail investors. Although there are still hurdles regarding regulation, technology and market maturation, the trend is unmistakable because the industry is becoming increasingly institutional and the regulation less experimental. The companies that learn and respond to this change will be in a good position to take advantage of the future of the tokenization of assets market, which will be worth 18.9 trillion in the next decade. Not all aspects of the digital asset revolution involve technology. They include redefining the very structures of finance to be inclusive, efficient and accessible worldwide. In the future, we expect that the seamless connection of RWAs into blockchain networks will require constant interaction between technologists, regulators and financial institutions to create a more interconnected and globalized financial process.

Title: Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/20/report-apple-held-internal-discussions-acquiring-perplexity/

UPDATED 19:42 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 by Maria Deutscher Apple Inc. executives have held discussions about buying Perplexity AI Inc., Bloomberg reported today. The publication cited sources as saying that the talks are in an early stage and may not lead to an acquisition. Perplexity reportedly received a $14 billion valuation in a recent funding round. To be accepted, any takeout offer made by Apple would likely have to be higher. San Francisco-based Perplexity operates a consumer-focused search engine powered by artificial intelligence models. Rather than returning a list of webpages in response to queries, the service generates a natural language response. It can also visualize stock price changes, analyze user-uploaded files and perform other tasks. Perplexity had more than 15 million monthly users last April, a number that has likely increased significantly since then. The company recently disclosed that it processed 780 million user requests in May. Moreover, the volume of queries that it receives is growing by 20% every month. Perplexity generates revenue by offering two paid editions of its search engine. The first, Perplexity Pro, gives users access to reasoning models from providers such as OpenAI. There’s also an Enterprise Pro plan geared towards large organizations. Perplexity’s other revenue source is its Sonar suite of application programming interfaces for developers. Using the APIs, software teams can embed the core features of the company’s search engine into their custom applications. Adrian Perica, Apple’s vice president of corporate development, has reportedly discussed the idea of buying Perplexity with a number of other executives. It’s believed the search provider wasn’t involved in the talks. However, Apple representatives did meet with Perplexity executives multiple times recently to discuss its technology. Today’s report follows an unsuccessful attempt by Meta Platforms Inc. to acquire Perplexity. According to Bloomberg, the Facebook parent walked away from the deal over disagreements about financial terms. Meta later made a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI Inc., a startup that supplies training datasets for AI development projects. It’s believed that Apple could eventually decide to partner with Perplexity instead of buying it. Such an arrangement would likely cost significantly less. Additionally, it would have a lower chance of drawing scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The acquisition discussions come against the backdrop of a high-profile antitrust trial over Google LLC’s search business. Currently, the Alphabet unit pays Apple billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default option on iOS. The lawsuit could potentially require the companies to end the payments. If that happens, Apple may be more inclined to partner with Google competitors such as Perplexity. Perplexity is not the only AI startup that has drawn takeover interest. According to CNBC, Meta recently tried to buy Safe Superintelligence Inc., a company co-founded by former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. After the offer was rebuffed, the Facebook parent reportedly shifted its focus to recruiting the startup’s top executives.

Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs are near-locks at 95% odds of approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025, the analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart of Bloomberg, wrote Friday. Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche spot ETF applications are also sitting quite pretty, according to the analysts, with 90% chance of approval by year end. If the above altcoin ETF applications receive an SEC green light in the coming months, then the development would mark a substantial milestone in the history of Wall Street. Thus far, the agency has approved only two categories of crypto spot ETFs: Bitcoin and Ethereum. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The success of those funds has spurred additional demand for crypto-focused ETFs and other related investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage well over $100 billion in assets, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reaching $70 billion in AUM faster than any fund in history, based on company data. Crypto’s two top tokens have long been considered to belong to a league of their own in terms of legitimacy, stability, and staying power, and even their approval for mainstream trading was no easy feat. Among the current batch of contenders for spot ETF trading are tokens that have significantly smaller market values and less established reputations than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dogecoin, for instance, is the world’s first meme coin; Avalanche is the native token of a network that boasts less than 2% of the total value locked on Ethereum. DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain, boasts a market capitalization of just $5.2 billion, compared to $293 billion for ETH and $2.06 trillion for BTC, according to data provider CoinGecko. Should spot ETFs of such altcoins begin trading on Wall Street, that would mean that traditional financial institutions and retail investors would be able to gain direct exposure to the tokens, which have historically been volatile. Issuers of spot ETFs actually buy and store the cryptocurrencies represented by the financial products on behalf of clients. Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Decrypt it was a foregone conclusion that crypto ETFs would explode as soon as President Donald Trump, who campaigned avidly as a pro-crypto candidate, was reelected last fall. “It is regarded as inevitable that we’ll see many other single-asset and multi-asset ETFs of digital coins and tokens,” Edelman said. “The Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will prove to have been merely the first." “And all that’s just the start,” he continued. “Tokenization is underway and once all assets are tokenized, there will be thousands of ETFs, or their tokenized equivalents, launched. It’ll be the biggest explosion of investment opportunities ever." The Bloomberg analysts’ confidence that the SEC may soon approve so many crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH stems in part from the agency’s openness to engage with requests to list them in recent months—requesting updated details and public comments on numerous applications. The applications have been filed by several Wall Street firms, ranging from crypto-centric investment managers like Grayscale to TradFi stalwarts including Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. “Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion,” Bloomberg’s Seyffart said. Another factor that has likely increased the odds of imminent spot ETF approvals for the altcoins in question is the fact that, in recent months, the CFTC has approved futures markets for all of them. Futures ETFs track the prices of derivatives contracts for assets, but do not involve the actual buying or selling of the underlying asset. While the Bloomberg analysts are confident that altcoin spot ETFs will garner approvals before the end of the year, the exact timing remains uncertain. Seyffart said they could come in the next month, or perhaps not until the late fall—but that at this point, the question is a “matter of when not if.” Brian Rudick, chief strategy office at Upexi, a publicly traded Solana-focused treasury company, told Decrypt that while ETF approvals for certain altcoins with lower trading volume may not necessarily result in immediately higher demand for those tokens, Wall Street debuts could have a dramatic price impact on more popular tokens like Solana. “While demand for ETFs on long-tail alts may not materialize, ETFs based on top assets like Solana will likely see strong inflows and may act as a large positive catalyst for the price of the underlying token,” Rudick said. “Indeed, the spot ETFs were the main reason the price of Bitcoin more than doubled from when BlackRock applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 through the exceptional inflows over the first six months after launch.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Ramp Raises $200 Million for Expense and Biz Travel Management: Startup Funding Roundup

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Credit: Ramp offers corporate cards as part of its tech service for managing business travel and expenses. Ramp Startups for business travel management and flying taxis are still raising a lot of money. Select a question above or ask something else There’s a lot of money going into tech platforms to manage business travel and expenses. The most recent is Ramp, which raised $200 million this week. It comes months after TravelPerk raised $200 million, with multiple other companies raising smaller rounds. Also this week: Navan, a corporate travel agency, has taken a step toward becoming a public company. And flying taxi companies — most recently Archer Aviation — have been raising billions of dollars in their race to operate commercially. Between Ramp, Archer Aviation, and a small startup, travel companies raised over $1 billion in the past week. Ramp, an expense management platform with travel booking capabilities, has raised $200 million in series E funding. The latest funding values the company at $16 billion, a jump from $13 billion since its previous fundraise in March and $7.65 billion since its series D extension in 2024. Founders Fund led the round for the fifth time. Other investors included Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, General Catalyst, GIC, ICONIQ Growth, Khosla Ventures, Sands Capital, 8VC, Lux Capital, Stripes, 137 Ventures, Avenir Growth, and Definition Capital. Ramp said it has now raised a total of $1.4 billion in equity financing. The New York City-based company started with a focus on corporate cards and helping clients manage receipts, but it’s been building out tech since 2022 to help client companies book and manage travel. The company’s Ramp Travel product allows clients’ employees to book travel with inventory from Priceline. The platform also has integrations with TravelPerk, Lyft and Uber for Business. Ramp automatically collects receipts from any bookings with partners, removing the need to submit expenses. Client companies can set travel policies and manage approvals through the platform. Ramp last month released a feature that automatically rebooks a hotel if the price drops. It’s one of 270 features that the company has released this year, which the company said were all developed with the help of AI. Ramp said it has more than 40,000 companies, including CBRE, Shopify, Anduril, Notion, Cursor, Vercel, and Barry's. The company said its platform handles $80 billion in purchases annually. Ramp said the funding will go toward improving the AI-powered product and expanding business, particularly in the U.S. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for urban use, has raised $850 million. The funding comes from a direct offering of 85 million shares of stock for $10 per share. The company had previously raised nearly $2 billion, including $430 million last year. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines. The company is also developing aircraft for the U.S. military. Archer said in May that it plans to provide air taxi services for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and for Team USA. The company last year unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. Travlounge, which designs roadside rest stops with sleeping pods, has raised $2.9 million (250 million Indian rupees). The funding comes from Gokulam Group. India-based Travlounge says its facilities include tech-enabled sleeping pods, washrooms, cafes, travel-focused markets, and charging stations for electric vehicles. The company has also released an app for trip planning. The funding will go toward expanding beyond its first two locations in India.

Title: All the reasons why Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in Q3!

A $750 million bet, whale surge, and momentum – ETH vs BTC heats up! Q2 is nearly on the books, and Ethereum [ETH] has delivered a comeback quarter in every sense. With nearly 40% quarterly gains so far, ETH has outpaced Bitcoin’s [BTC] 28.81% ROI, marking a sharp reversal from its bruising Q1. At the time, ETH bled nearly 50% from its $3,334 opening. That drawdown left a big chunk of holders underwater. And, despite Q2’s rally, many still haven’t fully resurfaced. Could Q3 be the inflection point where Ethereum finally delivers for the holders who sat through the pain? Q1 pushed Ethereum to the edge, and early Q2 didn’t offer much relief. Structurally though, the tide began to shift. ETH has steadily reclaimed market dominance, climbing back towards its 10% share – A sharp reversal from the record low of 6.95% on 22 April. At the same time, the ETH/BTC ratio hit a five-year low, lining up with ETH’s own multi-year bottom at $1,441 in mid-April. That moment felt like rock bottom. However, it also set the stage for a serious bounce. By early May, the ratio had ripped over 25% off the lows, right as ETH smashed through the $2k resistance and sprinted to a quarterly high of $2,878 on 11 June. And yet, the move doesn’t feel like it’s run its course just yet. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Since mid-May, the ratio has moved sideways. However, it’s been printing higher lows with every dip – A classic sign of accumulation. Buyers are stepping in faster, the pullbacks are shallower, and rotational flows into ETH remain steady. If this pattern resolves higher, ETH could carry its Q2 breakout into Q3 with serious follow-through. This could set the stage for a potential trend reversal in the ETH/BTC macro structure. Smart money isn’t backing off Ethereum. In fact, BlackRock has deployed $750 million into ETH in June so far, and hasn’t sold a single coin. That kind of conviction doesn’t show up unless the upside looks meaningful. According to AMBCrypto, with a 40% quarterly rally already in the books, Ethereum has been drawing in serious capital chasing asymmetric returns. Case in point – Lookonchain flagged a sharp move where a whale borrowed 10 million USDT to buy 3,983 ETH at $2,510.64. Clearly, it’s not just institutional flows doing the heavy lifting. The whale address count (1k–10k ETH) surged to a two-year high of 4,970 too, signaling that deep-pocketed players may be stepping back in with size. Source: Glassnode And when that kind of capital rotates in, it’s usually not by accident. Given Ethereum’s clear technical and statistical edge over Bitcoin throughout Q2, this shift feels more like a calculated reallocation than a short-term trade. Zooming out, the signals might be aligning too. With rising whale activity, institutional flows, and a strong ETH/BTC base, ETH could be set to carry its Q2 dominance into Q3, finally giving LTHs the upside they’ve been waiting on.

The past seven days in Waymo’s world illustrates just how dynamic the burgeoning robotaxi business can be. The company limited service nationwide on June 13 ahead of scheduled “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump and his policies. Days later, Waymo announced it was expanding its robotaxi service area by another 80 square miles in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Silicon Valley. And now Waymo is eyeing the biggest city in the United States: New York City. One note on NYC: This will be a marathon for Waymo. The company is applying for a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in the city, but even if it gets approved, it won’t mean driverless testing. A truly driverless (no human behind the wheel) vehicle will require a change in state law. Expect lobbying activity to ramp up in the state. Let’s get into the rest of the news. Got a tip for us?

Applied Intuition keeps attracting investors, and it has an eye-popping valuation to show for it. The buzzy startup, which makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions such as simulation software and managing data, closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer. That round, which was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and Kleiner Perkins, pushed its valuation up to $15 billion. Yes, $15 billion.Other investors included Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Greycroft, and more. Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated. Reminder: The round comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. Archer Aviation raised an additional $850 million through a registered direct offering of 85 million shares at $10 per share. The company noted in its announcement that this followed President Trump’s executive order to implement an eVTOL Integration Pilot Program in the United States. Senra Systems, a Southern California-based startup developing wire harnesses for aerospace, raised $25 million in a round co-led by Dylan Field, the co-founder and CEO of design software company Figma; VC firm CIV; General Catalyst; Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund; Sequoia Capital; Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC; and Andreessen Horowitz. This newsletter used to have a dedicated section for micromobility, a reflection of its popularity at the time. Micromobility went through a period of consolidation and tightening capital, which forced the industry to grow up. But it hasn’t disappeared, and that’s why I’m bringing it back this week (and occasionally in the future).Reporter Rebecca Bellan hosted a roundtable with Voi CEO Fredrik Hjelm, Bird co-CEO Michael Washinushi, and Dott/Tier CEO Henri Moissinac at the Micromobility Europe event in Brussels. Here are some of her insights from the panel and from the broader event: Honda launched an all-electric last-mile delivery vehicle called the Fastport eQuad. The eQuad comes in two sizes built on the same basic platform, small and large. Both are smaller than the smallest Mini Cooper but can carry between 320 and 650 pounds. They have pedals, and their top speed is limited to 12 mph (20 kph), both requirements to keep them bike-lane legal. VanMoof is back and has launched its first e-bike since bankruptcy. Reporter Rebecca Bellan digs into what is the same and what has changed at VanMoof. Bellan also provided a list of startups rolling out of Europe’s early-stage micromobility scene. Zoox has opened its first full-fledged production facility, where it expects to one day build 10,000 robotaxis per year. Tesla has partnered with Electrify Expo to launch full-weekend EV test drives. This is an interesting move by Tesla, which has historically used other methods besides third-party events like auto shows or expos to attract new customers. It also could make Electrify Expo a target of protestors who are behind the Tesla Takedown movement. Zoomcar, the Indian car-sharing marketplace, said a hacker accessed the personal data of at least 8.4 million customers, including their names, phone numbers, and car registration numbers. The company became aware of the incident after some of its employees received external communications from a threat actor who claimed to have gained access to the company’s data. The Paris Air Show included lots of news under the ever-evolving category I call “Future of flight.” Too much to cover everything here, but there were a few highlights: an announcement from U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy that the Federal Aviation Administration and four other regulators will collaborate on an advanced air mobility (AAM) roadmap; Archer Aviation showcased its Midnight aircraft and hosted delegations from more than 20 countries; and Beta Technologies’ Alia became the first electric aircraft to fly at the show.

Share this article Just a few years ago, the idea of using digital currency to book a flight or pay for a service seemed unreal. Today, it happens in real time, and businesses of every size now accept Bitcoin. As of 2024, Crypto.com estimates that more than 650 million people worldwide now hold some form of crypto. Major financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and PayPal have incorporated crypto into their offerings, which signals widespread crypto adoption. Consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, invest in crypto and actively look for ways to spend it. In this regard, businesses that adapt to these changing payment behaviors can gain a meaningful competitive edge. Let’s talk about practical benefits. When businesses accept Bitcoin payments, they often pay lower transaction fees. With Bitcoin, fees are often about $1-2, especially when using crypto payment gateways. Another key benefit? No chargebacks. Unlike credit card payments, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. It means fewer fraud claims and less back-office overhead dealing with disputes. Also, cross-border payments have become much easier. If your business serves international customers, Bitcoin can eliminate the headaches of currency exchange and high wire transfer fees. All this adds up to smoother, faster, and often cheaper transactions. Businesses of all sizes already accept Bitcoin. Shopify merchants have access to crypto payment integrations, which allow thousands of e-commerce stores to accept Bitcoin easily. In the restaurant world, spots like The Pink Cow in Tokyo and Crypto Street Restaurant in Florida made headlines for being early adopters. Even big corporations like Microsoft and AT&T have accepted Bitcoin in various forms. But it’s not just the giants benefiting. Independent cafes, freelance creatives, and small retailers report increased visibility and customer loyalty just by offering Bitcoin as a payment option. Consumers aren’t just curious, they’re ready to spend. A 2022 survey by Deloitte and PayPal found that 75% of retailers plan to accept crypto payments within the next two years, and 64% of surveyed consumers said they’d be more likely to shop with a business that accepts cryptocurrency. What’s driving this demand? Control, speed, and a sense of innovation. Consumers like to have choices, and they expect businesses to keep up with digital trends. Ignoring this shift could mean missing out on a fast-growing segment of tech-savvy customers. Let’s be honest, Bitcoin volatility is a valid concern. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods, which makes some business owners hesitate. The good news is that you don’t need to hold onto Bitcoin to accept it. Special platforms serve to convert Bitcoin into local currency instantly, which reduces your exposure to price fluctuations. Security is another common worry, but modern solutions make crypto safer than ever. Using a trusted crypto wallet for business adds a layer of protection, and payment processors handle much of the heavy lifting when it comes to compliance and fraud prevention. Getting started with Bitcoin payments is easier than you might think: Choose a payment processor. These services can integrate with your online store or point-of-sale system. Set up your wallet. Whether you use a custodial service or manage your own, having a secure crypto wallet is important to store your assets securely. Let customers know. Display online badges that show you accept Bitcoin. Promote it in your email campaigns or on social media. No deep technical knowledge is required, and setup costs are often minimal. In fact, many services are free to start with and only charge a small percentage per transaction. Accepting Bitcoin is easier than you might think. You don’t need to change how your business runs. Bitcoin payment just adds more payment flexibility for your customers. It’s affordable to set up, demand is growing, and the tools to start are easy to use. The benefits are big: you can reach new customers, save on transaction fees, speed up payments, and show that your business is forward-thinking. So why wait? The future of payments is here.

Mondelez International (MDLZ) stock was one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 Friday after Wells Fargo upgraded its rating and lifted its price target on the snacks and candy giant. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their rating to "overweight" from "equal weight" and raised their price target to $78 from $68, saying the "bull case feels more tangible" for the Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, and Sour Patch Kids parent. "While the company is confronting historical inflation in 2025, 1) pricing execution has been strong, 2) inflation looks likely to temper in 2026, and we see a recovery of earnings ahead," the analysts wrote. Mondelez International shares were up more than 3% in recent trading to about $68.50. They have gained roughly 15% this year.

Title: CEOs Using AI to Terrorize Their Employees

Time Published: 2025-06-20T17:09:36Z

As artificial intelligence becomes the corporate buzzword du jour, executives are finding more and more ways to shoehorn the trendy tech into their everyday business operations. That has a lot of workers anxious about automation, income inequality, and increased workloads — something c-suite bigwigs are all too happy to take advantage of. Though AI — really just a fun name for large language models (LLMs), or predictive chatbots — in its current state isn't likely to bring a labor revolution anytime soon, CEOs find that the threat of AI automation works just as well. As Axios highlighted this week, CEOs are increasingly using AI adoption as a cudgel to justify layoffs, or to manufacture consent for layoffs in the future. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, recently said AI is likely to "reduce our total corporate workforce," while JPMorgan executives told investors that AI will allow for a "10 percent headcount reduction." Others, like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, are threatening workers directly, saying that AI is now the "baseline expectation." Per Axios, Shopify managers hiring human workers now have to explain to top brass why AI wouldn't be a better choice for any given job. This kind of doomsday messaging goes hand in hand with increased expectations for workers' productivity. A recent survey found that 77 percent of workers reported that AI adds to their workload. Of that, a staggering proportion — 39 percent — involves fixing the buggy tech's sloppy mistakes. While AI is a pretty recent phenomenon, these kinds of scare tactics aren't new. "Disciplining labor" is a concept that occasionally gets thrown around discussions of supply side economics. It's a term used to describe broad economic measures that keep workers in line, in order to keep corporate profits high — suppressing unions, keeping wage growth low, and dangling the threat of unemployment over their heads. In this sense, AI in its current form is simply a new whip for CEOs to use on their employees. It's having what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, calls an "inculcation effect" on workers. It's a "warning with an anticipatory alert that preempts later trauma going viral," he told Axios. Plus, now that the job market has been devastated by AI spambots, finding a new gig is harder than ever. With AI, workers are forced onto their back foot as their corporate overlords demand more productivity for less pay. If the choice is to either work harder or clear out their desk, employees are then less likely to ask for quality of life improvements, or to organize for unions that could win them. And that, of course, means corporate honchos get an even bigger piece of the pie.

Visa (V) shares slid this week after the Senate on Tuesday passed the GENIUS Act, providing a regulatory framework for companies issuing stablecoins. The crypto-friendly legislation could open the door for merchants to bypass card-based payment systems offed by Visa and other payments providers. Reports surfaced last week that Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) were looking into launching their own stablecoins, a move that could potentially eat away at the billions of dollars the retail titans pay in credit transaction fees. Shares of Visa were little changed in Friday afternoon trading, just above $338, leaving them down about 4% for the week. Still, they've gained roughly 7% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500, which added less than 2% over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at Visa’s chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Earlier this month, the stock climbed above its prominent March and May peaks, before staging a sharp reversal to form a bull trap, a trading event that lures investors to buy upon a breach of major resistance—the two peaks in this case—before the price makes a sudden move lower. As recent peaks on the chart made higher highs, the relative strength index (RSI) made comparatively shallower peaks to create a bearish divergence and indicate waning buying momentum. The stock closed decisively below the respected 50-day moving average (MA) in Wednesday’s trading session, possibly paving the way for further selling. The first support level to watch sits around $328. A retracement to this area may attract buying interest near the March swing low, which currently lies just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. A more significant drop could see the shares revisit lower support near $302. Investors may look for entry points in this region around the stock’s April sell-off low and last November’s breakaway gap. During upswings in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $350 level. The shares may face overhead selling pressure in this area near the rising 50-day MA, which currently sits alongside the late March peak and minor February trough. Buying above this level could fuel a move toward $367. Investors who have bought Visa shares at lower prices may look for exit points in this location near the March and May peaks. This level sits in the same neighborhood as a projected downside target that takes the stock’s move lower from March to April and repositions it from the May high, potentially providing clues as to how a new downtrend may play out.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization Hits $24 Billion As Wall Street Bets Big

ByAnastasia Chernikova ByAnastasia Chernikova, Contributor. Major financial institutions are racing to tokenize everything from U.S. Treasuries to real estate, but how long will it last? The tokenization revolution is accelerating at breakneck speed with the Senate just passing the GENIUS Act, providing the first federal framework for digital assets that Wall Street had been waiting for. Over 185 crypto tokens are classified as Real-World Assets (RWAs) with their market capitalization over $10.62 billion, a 61% increase from the previous month, according to Tangem. On top of that, the total market value of tokenized RWAs on public blockchains had surged to nearly $18 billion by early 2025, up from about $10 billion just a year before. This unprecedented growth has been driven by institutional adoption that's finally materializing. “The adoption curve we’re seeing from major institutions like JPMorgan marks the opening chapter of a multi‑trillion‑dollar transition that will accelerate, not reverse, as infrastructure and regulation mature,” Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization at Chainlink Labs, told me in a written response. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund now holds $2.9 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the world’s largest tokenized asset fund. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI follows at $776 million, while VanEck launched its tokenized RWA fund called VBILL, offering exposure to US Treasury bills across multiple blockchains in partnership with Securitize. “BlackRock tokenized a money market fund on Ethereum. Franklin Templeton is running US government bond funds on public blockchains. JPMorgan just ran a cross chain Delivery versus Payment pilot with Chainlink and Ondo. These are not retail projects. These are the most conservative institutions in finance validating a new model,” Mitchell DiRaimondo, founder at Steelwave Digital, told me in a written response. The current market shows $24 billion in total tokenized assets across 194 issuers, with over 205,000 asset holders, indicating steady growth despite market volatility. Tokenization strips away the friction that has plagued traditional asset management for decades. Settlement times drop from days to minutes, previously illiquid assets like real estate can be traded 24/7, and compliance becomes programmable rather than paper-based. “The biggest risk today is assuming that a legal wrapper and a blockchain alone create value,” Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, told me. "Without real composability, reliable secondary markets, and trusted custody, tokenized assets remain stuck in marketing decks rather than investment portfolios." Ethereum still dominates the tokenized asset landscape, hosting the majority of Real-World Asset value. But emerging Layer 2 solutions are gaining ground as institutions seek faster, cheaper transactions. The infrastructure buildout extends beyond blockchain networks. Zero-knowledge proofs are enabling privacy-preserving compliance, allowing banks to prove asset backing without revealing sensitive financial information. Cross-chain interoperability solutions are connecting fragmented tokenized asset markets. "The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs—which make it possible to securely verify that RWAs are backed by real world assets, without revealing sensitive information—has been a huge catalyst for RWAs," Maxim Legg, CEO of The Pangea Foundation, told me in a written response. "Banks are able to prove that their tokenized funds are backed by real assets, without disclosing sensitive financial information." “It’s a structural evolution in how private credit and fixed income funds operate,” David Robnett, Managing Director of Asset Token Ventures, told me in a written response. “Tokenization solves real-world inefficiencies, such as post-trade friction, tax drag, and illiquidity. That makes growth not just sustainable, but inevitable.” Unlike the speculative crypto cycles of previous years, RWA tokens offer something fundamentally different: real yield backed by real assets. Tokenized Treasury bills currently yield 4-5%, while private credit tokens can offer 8-10% returns—comparable to traditional alternatives but with blockchain’s added benefits. “Unlike the NFT bubble, where speculative JPEGs dominated and predictably lost value, NFT 2.0, AKA Tokenized RWAs, are grounded in utility,” Dan Silverman, CEO at Balcony Technology, told me in an interview. "The RWA is worth what the underlying asset is worth, eliminating the volatility of speculative hype." While stablecoins, tokenized fiat currencies representing over $240 billion of the RWA market, have paved the way, the focus is now shifting to higher-yielding tokenized assets. The GENIUS Act’s framework creates the regulatory foundation for the broader RWA expansion. Here is the sector breakdown: U.S. Treasuries: $6.2 billion (led by BlackRock’s BUIDL at $2.5 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI at $776 million) Private Credit: $12.9 billion (platforms like Centrifuge, Maple, and Apollo's new tokenized fund) Commodities: $1.4 billion (primarily tokenized gold through Tether Gold and Paxos Gold) Real Estate: Growing rapidly, with about $3.8 billion in tokenized properties "Real-World Asset is real and sustainable. It's likely to go in waves," Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at Ernst & Young, told me in an interview. "We are going to move towards a second wave of real-world assets like real estate, physical infrastructure, intellectual property, and more that exist off-chain but could benefit from the automation possible with smart contracts and in the efficiency of on-chain settlement." Regulatory clarity and guidelines for tokenized assets remain critical for their future development. Infrastructure scaling with cross-chain interoperability solutions and institutional-grade custody services are also maturing rapidly. “Interoperability, regulation, and compliance are the biggest gating factors. Assets must move seamlessly across public and private chains, reference tamper‑proof data, and fit within clear legal frameworks,” Colin Cunningham of Chainlink Labs told me. “We’re already seeing some efforts from regulators to clarify the rules for digital assets, and institutions are adopting Chainlink’s cross‑chain messaging to avoid the ‘walled‑garden’ problem. I expect the tokenized market to expand materially over the next twelve months, both in the volume of assets onchain and the breadth of traditional finance players participating.” The RWA market is projected to hit a $50 billion market cap by the end of this year. For investors, this represents both opportunity and risk, but the institutional validation is real—BlackRock doesn't deploy billions into experimental technologies. "The promise of RWAs is to deliver the efficiency and immediacy of crypto markets to a wider investor pool," Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena, wrote to me in a response. "We’re not trying to tear down the financial system. We’re upgrading it." The smart money is actively participating, with careful due diligence and risk management. Whether this marks the dawn of a new financial era will depend on execution.

Title: Banks that fuelled Ireland’s finance rebound face tariff angst

When the United States launched sweeping tariffs against trade partners in April, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink found himself in Ireland, one of the countries with most to lose if US multinationals were forced to curtail their operations overseas. Fink, whose company was in the running for a big contract with the Irish government at the time, toed a careful line, claiming to “understand the logic” of Donald Trump’s move while not agreeing with it, and insisting there “does not need to be a true trade war”. Almost three months on, the Wall Street giants that created thousands of Dublin jobs since Brexit are in a similarly awkward position. They’re trying to balance the challenges created by their own government with the opportunities in a country that depends on US multinationals for more than 10 per cent of its jobs and a big chunk of tax receipts. For now, the banks are hopeful their multinational clients will adapt to the trade uncertainty. “It’s not obvious to me that that falls off a cliff” under the threat of tariffs, says Marc Hussey, the Irish-born JPMorgan Chase & Co executive who returned home to run the bank’s 1,500-strong Dublin business in 2022. Assuming multinationals will “shrink overnight” would be an “extreme view”, Hussey added, and he is “not sensing that from any of our clients”. He continues to see growth in the range of businesses he oversees including a global funds administration centre, a workplace solutions business that runs employment share programmes across the world and the EMEA hub for Chase payments technology. Ireland remains popular in JPMorgan’s head office too – chief executive Jamie Dimon will travel to Dublin next month to speak at an event, his fourth such trip in six years. Almost a decade on from the Brexit vote that cut off London’s banks from several markets inside the European Union, Ireland has become a big draw for foreign lenders. They now employ close to 15,000 people, according to a report from the Federation of International Banks in Ireland (FIBI) last month, with firms including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America leading the way to set up big EU businesses in the State. That choice puts them at the eye of the tariffs storm in a market that has long been heavily exposed to US multinationals, prompting recent warnings about the outlook for the economy and the risk to financial stability. As part of the EU, Ireland’s fate is tied to negotiations with Trump in advance of a July 9th deadline, after which nearly all of the bloc’s imports to the US might be hit with a 50 per cent levy. Across the river Liffey from JPMorgan’s offices, Citi’s 2,900 staff are working across an innovation hub, the group’s EU bank headquarters and an international corporate banking businesses. Citi chief executive Jane Fraser was in town a few weeks ago to mark the bank’s 60th anniversary in the State, and hailed Ireland as “a hub for innovation, a magnet for multinationals and a vital part of the world’s economic landscape”. The bank’s new Dublin office, to be opened next year with space for an extra 400 staff, is “a symbol of our long-term investment in Ireland and in Europe”, she added in a LinkedIn post. Hussey is hoping the move increases the chances of a long-promised footbridge that would link JPMorgan on Dublin’s southside to the northside of the Liffey, where Citi’s new office will join the Central Bank’s headquarters. Davinia Conlan, Citi’s Ireland head and chairwoman of FIBI, argues that there is “a lot to be positive about from an Ireland domestic economy perspective” and she is hopeful that Citi will ultimately fill its 3,300 capacity in the new site, though she’s not putting any timeline on that. “We’re still expecting the economy to grow albeit at a slower pace than we would’ve seen previously,” she said. Ireland also offers companies the benefit of “ease of access” to Government, Conlan said. The Department of Finance will soon launch an industry consultation on its next international financial services strategy, a successor to the Ireland for Finance strategy launched in 2020 which covers banks, insurers, funds and other firms that, combined, employ about 60,000. Regulatory simplification will be high on the industry’s wish list, Conlan and her peers say, with firms set to call on Ireland to remove some “gold-plating” of EU rules and to push the bloc to be more competitive around regulation. The international banks’ federation, FIBI, is preparing a proposal on simplification which will offer examples of areas where regulation can be “more efficient”, Conlan said, declining to offer gold-plating examples before that. Investments in infrastructure and housing, including a long-promised airport metro, will also be on the list. Fernando Vicario, who heads Bank of America’s Dublin-based EU head office, is hopeful that imminent reform of the EU’s securitisation market will offer a further boost for his 1,300-strong team, which has been retaining its earnings to support future growth. “Ireland can be a place where these securitisation deals can be packaged out of Ireland into the rest of Europe,” he said, adding that the State already commands a big presence in this market. Vicario does not expect the Irish Government to pivot to protectionist sentiment, which has cropped up in some countries in response to Trump’s trade approach. “I learned in Boston that America is Irish,” says Vicario. “In business, people stick to their positions and do business. And we do business with Irish-headquartered companies and with Irish branches and subsidiaries of US companies, all day long. I have quite frankly no problem whatsoever with our passport referring to our US origin.” Ireland has shown it has no problems with US companies either: following Fink’s careful diplomacy, BlackRock was last month named a preferred bidder to help manage the State’s upcoming multibillion-euro auto-enrolment workplace pension programme. – Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto stocks soar after Senate passes stablecoin bill, Circle up over 50%

Catherine McGrath is a crypto fellow at Fortune. Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week. Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday. The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions. Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night. “History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote. The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry. Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies. With support from the U.S. president and increasing regulatory clarity, mainstream corporations are considering implementing them into their payment structures, including Meta, Google, AirBnB and X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Andy Jassy says AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce but at least he’s honest about it

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the quiet part out loud this week, predicting AI will reduce its workforce. At least he’s honest about it, even if he trotted out the “free up workers for higher-value work” cliche. Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its staff too, no doubt for partly the same reason. Can Mark Zuckerberg vault Meta into the top tier of AI providers via acquihire? He sure seems to be trying. Meantime, Google kept up its recent stream of new models coming with an entry-level edition, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite. Continuing a recent series of Silicon Valley tech companies chasing the opportunity in government technology, OpenAI won a hefty defense contract. Speaking of big money in AI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab reportedly raised $2 billion on a $10 billion valuation. And in late-breaking news, Apple reportedly has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity. Two enterprise tech stalwarts attempted to position themselves to take advantage of customers’ focus on AI and data and the evolving mix of public and private cloud services needed for that. For one, Broadcom announced the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the latest iteration of its private cloud platform. Pure Storage also introduced its Enterprise Data Cloud, a rethink of enterprise storage aimed at recasting itself not just as a storage vendor but as a platform for autonomous data operations. At its re:Inforce conference this week, Amazon Web Services issued a raft of new features all aimed at making cybersecurity simpler, led by a preview release of a new version of AWS Security Hub. Texas Instruments joined the pack of chipmakers promising to build much more domestic factory capacity, saying it will invest $60 billion in U.S. fabs, though the time frame is not clear. Meanwhile, the Intel shakeup continued with several new executives … and several thousand fewer factory workers. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Must-read for anyone wondering what’s next for data and data platforms: Ali Ghodsi’s data intelligence playbook: Turning data into agentic advantage The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims joins others on cautioning against assuming AGI is around the corner: Why superintelligent AI isn’t taking over anytime soon Maybe a good thing given the dangers even OpenAI admits: OpenAI exec warns of growing risk that AI could aid in biological weapons development Moreover, it appears that ChatGPT isn’t so great for learning, at least initially: Study finds that LLM use leads to ‘likely decrease’ in learning skills Meanwhile, on the job front: Andy Jassy says generative AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years He even used the canonical argument that these agents will free up human staff to take on more creative roles. But since Jassy is saying Amazon will have fewer employees as a result of AI, it appears that some will have to find those creative roles somewhere else. Of course, AI, like many new technologies, will also create new jobs, but it’s not yet clear how many. Amazon partner Anthropic predicts even more sweeping layoffs coming. Agentic AI is the disruption du jour at this year’s TM Forum DTW Ignite conference Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab valued at $10B after $2B fundraising (per Financial Times) Google updates Gemini 2.5 LLM series with new entry-level model, pricing changes Midjourney debuts new V1 video generation model Domino Data Lab introduces new AI governance, data management features Nurix AI launches enterprise-grade human-like voice AI agents with NuPlay Vehicle intelligence startup Applied Intuition raises $600M at $15B valuation OpenAI bags $200M Pentagon contract to explore defense industry AI applications Healthcare technology startup Commure raises $200M ahead of IPO AI startup Tennr raises $101M to revolutionize patient referrals Clay reportedly raises new funding led by CapitalG on a $3B valuation Maven AGI, which aims to unify the full “customer journey,” raised $50M in Series B funding Traversal launches with $48M to tackle site reliability and observability with AI Wildfire detection startup Pano AI raises $44M (per WSJ) Browserbase reels in $40M for its browser automation tools Sedai raises $20M to optimize cloud environments with AI agents Tadaweb raises $20M to scale open-source intelligence platform enhanced with AI Extend gets $17M in funding to boost the speed and accuracy of document processing with AI models Diskover gets $7.5M from Snowflake, NetApp and others to facilitate unstructured data discovery for AI Startup Typedef gets $5.5M seed funding to build customized data pipelines for AI model workloads There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Broadcom says VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 recognizes the ascendancy of private cloud And our analysis: VCF 9 goes live: Recapping the execution roadmap for Broadcom’s AI and cloud infrastructure vision Pure Storage launches unified data management cloud and new flash arrays AWS to introduce updated server CPU, new AI training chip Vibe coding, platform power and the new face of AppDev – theCUBE Research analysis Mixpanel expands analytics platform with metric trees, AI insights and experimentation tools Trend Micro debuts data center appliances with built-in cybersecurity software Key takeaways from Cisco Live 2025 Texas Instruments to invest $60B+ in US fab network Amazon to invest nearly $13B in data centers in Australia Coralogix gets $115M in funding to pioneer agentic AI-powered observability Defense technology startup Mach Industries raises $100M PostHog raises $70M to simplify software development projects Clinical AI startup Nabla to focus on agentic automation after raising $70M in funding With $27M in funding, Fleet wants to bring more freedom to enterprise device management Onebrief, a platform for operational planning and military staff workflows, reaches $1.1B valuation with $20M Series C extension, nearly doubling in 3 months Tensec to deliver real-time, cross-border payments to smaller businesses after raising $10M in funding We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Security researchers find 16B stolen credentials from malware in open cloud storage UBS confirms employee data leak after ransomware attack on supplier INKY warns of new QR code phishing tactic using embedded JavaScript AWS focuses on simplifying cloud security at re:Inforce 2025 conference CrowdStrike launches Falcon for AWS Security Incident Response at re:Inforce 2025 Operant AI expands Gatekeeper platform with MCP Gateway for AI runtime security New Commvault and Kyndryl partnership focuses on hybrid cloud recovery and regulatory compliance Apiiro report reveals industry differences are shaping generative AI risk profiles Kusari debuts AI-powered pull request security tool for software supply chain protection Cyolo updates privileged access platform with tools to monitor unmanaged vendor connections Dashlane adds AI phishing alerts to Omnix platform to bolster credential protection Base44 joins Wix in $80M deal to support natural language software development Bitdefender to acquire Mesh Security to bolster email protection for managed service providers Neovera acquires Greenway Solutions to expand fraud testing capabilities More cybersecurity news here Waymo’s robotaxis will soon hit the streets of New York City Trump will push TikTok deadline another 90 days SpaceX competitor Eutelsat raising €1.35B in new funding And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Amar Subramanya, head of engineering for Google’s Gemini chatbot, is leaving the company, employees were told in a reorganization announced last week.

Title: Top takeaways from BI's conversations with real-estate investors
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-tips-how-to-start-investing-property-homeowner-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-20T13:16:34Z

Happy Friday! It's not goodbye. It's see you later. I start the second half of my paternity leave next week. I'll be out for the summer, but you're in good hands with my UK colleague Hallam Bullock. Just try not to give him too much grief on July 4. In today's big story, some advice for people looking to get their real-estate empire off the ground. What's on deck Markets: Why understanding Goldman Sachs' "coffee culture" is so important for interns. Tech: How Gen Z is getting around the brutal market for entry-level jobs in the tech industry. Business: It turns out that Target's loss is Walmart's gain when it comes to wealthier customers. But first, location, location, location. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. On the path to financial freedom, real-estate investing is typically a key stop. The stock market or e-commerce side hustles can be popular options, but collecting investment properties is often viewed as the Holy Grail of setting yourself up financially. But real-estate investing doesn't come easy … or cheap. There's also plenty of risk when taking on so much debt. Lucky for you, BI's Kathleen Elkins has written extensively about people who have set up real-estate empires. That includes a couple who built a portfolio of over 100 units and now work part time and travel half the year. It might sound a world away from someone just starting out, but it didn't happen overnight. When they started scooping up investment properties, Letizia Alto and Kenji Asakura didn't even own a primary residence. They shared six main pieces of advice they always follow when trying to make money in real estate. Here are some more takeaways from Kathleen's conversations with real-estate investors: It's not just for people with deep pockets: High upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, potential renovations) can be a big deterrent for hopeful real-estate investors. But a little can sometimes go a long way. A former firefighter went from earning $1,600 a month to owning over 30 properties. He spoke to Kathleen about how he got creative to land a $3 million deal with just $30,000 in savings. Do your homework: Real estate's biggest challenge can be figuring out where you want to buy something. A 32-year-old who retired early thanks to his real-estate investments shared the two software tools he swears by to find markets to buy in and price rentals appropriately. Another investor said this business book helped shape his investing strategy. The beauty of being stuck in the middle: When you think of real estate, you might immediately gravitate to vacation-style properties or long-term rentals. However, some investors see the most value in mid-term rentals. Don't forget about taxes: Generating income from multiple properties complicates how you file your taxes. But as the aforementioned Asakura put it to Kathleen, "The tax code is essentially a series of incentives to encourage certain behavior that the government wants." Here's how they get the most out of their investments from a tax perspective. 1. An intern's guide to succeeding on Wall Street. If you're one of the lucky interns in Goldman Sachs' summer class, take full advantage of the company's coffee culture to build connections. And if you're over at Blackstone, CEO Steve Schwarzman thinks you should embrace the change. 2. Citi gets an AI level-up. The bank's trio of AI strategy leaders gave an inkling of what's to come in a memo seen by BI. It's scaling AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with its tools. Read more about the strategy. 3. Don't overpay for your Aperol spritzes this summer. The value of the US dollar has dropped amid trade war and deficit concerns. That means unfavorable exchange rates and transaction fees can jack up costs when traveling abroad. Here are some ways to avoid excess charges overseas. 1. Is AI rejecting your job application? As companies turn to AI to boost productivity, BI has spoken to many frustrated job seekers who wonder if humans are even reviewing their applications. BI reached out to seven companies, from Kraft Heinz to Google, to find out what role AI plays in their hiring process. Spoiler: their answers varied. 2. Harvey and LexisNexis hard-launched. AI legal-tech darling Harvey is partnering with LexisNexis to let users access the vast legal database within Harvey's app. The move strengthens Harvey's claim as the go-to legal software provider as its rivals make gains. 3. How young techies cope with the industry's hiring downturn. Gen Z is staying optimistic about tech jobs, though many have had to lower their expectations and take what they can get. Layoffs, getting ghosted by potential employers, and dealing with the threat of AI are just part of the process. 1. Wait, is Walmart cool now? Clothing sales are up 23% at the retail giant this year, and shoppers are sharing "haul" videos online, impressed by its surprisingly trendy finds. BI's Katie Notopoulos found Walmart is attracting wealthier customers overall and picking up some Target defectors. 2. Efficiency secrets of the Wall Street elite. Leaders in the hot, high-growth secondaries industry are busier than ever. Fourteen industry power players told BI their top efficiency tips, from fake calendar blocks to just saying "no." 3. Peyton Manning goes from signal caller to shot-caller. Manning's Omaha Productions is looking to move its content off the field. He recently spoke with BI about his production company's success and said there's no one-size-fits-all definition of an Omaha show. Not every pro athlete reaches Manning's roaring financial success, though. Kroger reports earnings. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Jump to

June 20, 2025 09:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Why Elon Musk’s US$34 billion loss wasn’t really that – and what it tells us about the philanthropy of the ultra-wealthy

University of St Andrews provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Following a sharp drop in Tesla’s share price, outlets reported that the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, had “lost” US$34 billion (£25 billion) in a single day. That figure exceeds the annual GDP of countries like Iceland, Jamaica or Mauritius. Gaining or losing even 0.001% of that wealth would be life-changing for most people. But, this “loss” is entirely nominal. A decline in share prices means Musk is technically worth less. If prices rebound, so does his net worth. While such volatility can devastate smaller investors reliant on their portfolios, it is a recurring feature of ultra-wealth. Consider the US$100 billion decline in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune during his Metaverse pivot, or the US$18 billion drop Microsoft founder Bill Gates experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. These share price shifts may reduce billionaires’ net worth on paper, but they rarely affect their lifestyle. Where they do matter however is in philanthropy. Here, timing is everything. The higher the share price at the point of donation, the greater the tax benefit, and the more reputational capital to be locked in. This raises deeper questions about how philanthropic incentives are structured, and who ultimately benefits. Get your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences. Although philanthropy is often associated with generosity, legacy or moral responsibility, these are only part of the picture. This is particularly true when it comes to major giving by the ultra-wealthy. Instead, from a wealth advisory perspective, one of the most strategically valuable (yet less publicly discussed) motivations is tax management. And, while many assume that philanthropy means donating money, tax systems often encourage the donation of appreciated assets, particularly shares, instead. As a worked example by the Bank of America illustrates, a US$50,000 donation in appreciated stock might easily present a tax benefit of almost US$10,000 over and above the tax benefits of donating the same amount in cash. Why is that? First of all, there is the potential of a tax deduction equal to the fair market value at the point of donation. The value of the asset at the point of donation is important for your tax deduction, not what you actually paid for it or whether its value is going to plunge in future. On top of that, there are opportunities to reduce other taxes too. This includes capital gains or inheritance taxes, the latter illustrated in the establishment of one of the world’s largest foundations, the Ford Foundation and its use as a vehicle to manage both inheritance tax and maintain corporate control. But the benefits of donating shares and other appreciated assets are not just financial. For high-profile donors, philanthropy also serves as a powerful tool for shaping public perceptions, projecting images of civic virtue, moral leadership, and social responsibility. It allows them to convert one form of capital, such as financial wealth, into others – social status, cultural influence or symbolic legitimacy. Volatile, appreciated and often bound-up assets can be unlocked and transformed into something far more enduring – a philanthropic legacy. Even if share prices plunge after the donation, the donor has already secured both a substantial tax benefit and a lasting philanthropic image. Tax management is a longstanding concern in philanthropy, particularly in relation to philanthropic foundations. But it really is donor advised funds (DAFs) that now warrant closer scrutiny as the real “warehouses of wealth”. Constituting one of the fastest-growing vehicles for philanthropy, DAFs act as “giving accounts”. They allow donors to claim charitable contributions and receive immediate tax deductions but without actually making an immediate charitable contribution to society. While donors technically give up ownership of these assets, they retain advisory privileges over whether and when resources are granted, to whom, and in what amounts. DAFs have no legal requirement to disburse funds within a specific timeframe. That means that any charitable spending can be delayed, potentially indefinitely, despite the upfront public subsidy via tax relief. All of these issues raise serious questions as to whether philanthropic architecture is ripe for reform. When donors can receive substantial tax and social benefits by donating volatile assets, regardless of whether or when they benefit the public, it seems that both society and the philanthropy field are shortchanged. First, significant resources are diverted from the public purse into privately controlled channels, often with limited oversight. Second, charitable giving is decoupled from charitable action or impact. Third, influence is consolidated – decisions about how public-subsidised funds are used are made not through democratic processes, but through private choice. The most corrosive effect, however, may be on philanthropy itself. As financial incentives and personal benefits are recast and presented as altruistic, the perception, purposes and potential of philanthropy for the public good risk being eroded and replaced by cynicism. This brings us back to Musk’s US$34 billion “loss”. While headlines framed it as a dramatic reversal of fortune, the real story lies not in the number but in the system behind it. For those whose wealth is held in stock, market volatility presents a tool for tax planning, image-making, strategic giving and long-term influence. What looks like loss may in fact be leverage.

The NY Times has been a major promoter of US “regime change” operations for decades. Today, while President Trump considers directly involving a US attack on Iran, the NYT is again performing this role despite many readers being skeptical or opposed. A June 19 NYT news/analysis is titled “An Islamic Republic With Its Back Against the Wall” by Roger Cohen. It seems written to pave the way for yet another US-backed or -directed “regime change”. The first sentence asserts without providing evidence that the Tehran government is “an unpopular and repressive regime”. An “Iran expert” is quoted saying, “The Islamic Republic is a rotten tooth waiting to be plucked, like the Soviet Union in its latter years.” . Screenshot from NYT . When Israel bombed the Iranian TV broadcast station as a female news anchor was reading the news, Cohen writes that “Some Iranians were overjoyed”. Cohen uses Netanyahu’s description that Israel’s attacks on Iran are “pre-emptive” and designed to “stop Iran using its enriched uranium to race for a bomb.” He does not mention that even the US intelligence agencies agree that Iran does NOT have a nuclear weapon program. Cohen goes on to quote former BlackRock executive and now German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz: “This mullah regime has brought death and destruction to the world.” Iran has invaded no countries while the US has invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria while Israel has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and now Iran. After suggesting some causes for caution, Cohen closes with his core message: the Tehran government may fall like the Berlin Wall. He quotes the “Iran expert” again: “The Islamic Republic is a zombie regime.” Roger Cohen has been an influential participant in NYT distortions and lies. In 2002, he became NYT foreign editor during the crucial run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As stated at his Wikipedia page, “He supported the invasion.” The deceit about the non-existent “weapons of mass destruction” was under Cohen’s direction. In early March, 2011, Roger Cohen said he was against Western intervention in Libya. Two weeks later, he urged the West to be “ruthless” and to kill the Libyan leader. This has turned out to be yet another disaster. The Libyan people are still paying the price while Roger Cohen has forgotten about it. Roger Cohen, representative of the Times, consistently finds a few voices of opposition, claims without evidence they represent a large group or the civilian majority, then promotes intervention, violence and “regime change”. He did this with Iraq, then Libya, now Iran. Judging from the most popular reader comments, many NYT readers are critical of this “news analysis”. The most popular comment has 1,600 endorsements. Dr. Finn Majlergaard from France says, “What right do you (Americans) think you have to decide who should be in power in sovereign countries when you can’t even deal with your own domestic dictator and the US regime’s gestapo methods against foreigners?” The second most popular comment is from Florence Massachussetts. The reader asks, “Will it be okay if a truly democratic nation bombs the United States in order to encourage regime change away from our current authoritarian rulers?” The vast majority of reader comments are critical of the drive to attack and possibly overthrow yet another government. Apparently they have learned from past foreign policy failures while the NY Times and foreign policy establishment have not. Another disaster based on false assumptions and arrogance lays ahead. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: S&P To Crash 50%? Trump Calls Jerome Powell “Dumbest”

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government [sic]". This is new territory. President Trump had mostly resisted from hurling direct insults against Fed Chair Powell in his second term. Not any more. Could this escalate into Trump firing Chair Powell over the next few months? The comment on social media followed the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, with the Federal Open Market Committee maintaining its target range at 4.25% to 4.5% - unchanged since December. Trump has been calling for lower rates, noting that the Fed was costing the country billions in interest payments. Facade of the Marriner S Eccles building of the United States Federal Reserve, on a bright and sunny ... More day in Washington, DC, United States, July 24, 2017. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Trump’s rhetoric sure does make headlines, but the real danger for investors is the Fed buckling under political pressure and cutting rates too soon. That could unleash a second wave of inflation, which might be more entrenched than the post-Covid surge. If that happens, expect a sharp reset in valuations, a spike in bond yields, and a steep correction in the S&P 500. Cutting interest rates before inflation is fully tamed risks igniting a more persistent cycle of price increases, forcing the Fed to respond later with even more aggressive hikes, just as it did in the 1970s, when inflation spiraled out of control. Is 50% drop in S&P possible? Consider this. Back then, the Fed’s delayed tightening led to stagflation and a severe equity downturn: the S&P 500 fell nearly 50% between 1972 and 1974. What’s more, higher valuations today, coupled with policy uncertainty, might actually make things worse. For investors seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative. This portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered cumulative returns of over 91% since inception. Trump's Policies Create The Perfect Storm? This time around, there is a risk of persistent supply-side inflation driven by policy. Trump’s policy agenda, which includes 3 things [1] tariffs, [2] mass deportations, and [3] tax cuts, could create a perfect storm of sorts. First, tariffs are a supply shock. They raise input costs and consumer prices by removing cheaper imports from the market. Second, mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except that it will make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. This could be a big factor driving inflation higher. Third, there are the tax cuts under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, under which most taxpayers are expected to see a tax cut, with all income groups reportedly likely to benefit. Now, while tariffs and deportations constrain the supply of goods and services to increase prices, reduction in taxes makes more cash available to consumers. So people can spend more while prices are higher. The result would be spiking inflation, and this would make the Fed’s job a lot harder. A Replay of the 1970s? The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now, if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings - risk-free investments - won’t you demand higher earnings and returns from stocks as well? There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) had lost more than 50% in the 2022 rate cycle alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?). Smaller companies, with less cash on their balance sheets, fared even worse. That said, in 2022, inflation was largely transitory, and the Fed was able to bring it under control. This time, it could be entrenched. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time, tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together, are likely to prove a stronger and perhaps much more persistent force. A replaying of the 1970s crisis is very much possible, taking the S&P 500 down. Higher rates don’t just hurt stocks - they make U.S. debt less sustainable. Annual interest payments now already exceed $1 trillion, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a red flag. If bond markets start to question the government’s fiscal path, yields could spike, deepening the equity selloff. On top of that, loan defaults are rising both in the commercial real estate sector and across consumer debt, like credit cards and auto loans. Big lenders like JPMorgan, BofA, and Citigroup are especially exposed. So, how much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $47 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $23 trillion in value. And you thought the $5 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first few days of April 2025 was bad! How Low Can JPMorgan Stock Go In A Market Crash? A Question When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) With a 15% rise year-to-date (YTD), Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has fared much better than the broader S&P 500 index, which has gained just 2%. This outperformance is partly attributed to rising demand for Azure amid the AI boom. Microsoft’s substantial AI investments, especially its partnership with OpenAI, have made Azure a highly appealing cloud platform for businesses looking to integrate AI into their operations. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, MSFT stock has doubled since early 2023, supported by three major factors: We’ll examine these drivers in more detail. While MSFT stock has delivered strong returns, those seeking growth with less volatility than individual stocks might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see Archer Aviation: What’s Happening With ACHR Stock? Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% rise in revenue, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $270 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Microsoft's stock has experienced a significant increase in valuation multiples, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio jumping 48% from 9x in 2022 to 13.3x currently. Several key factors are driving this sustained growth: Currently trading around $480, MSFT stock’s P/S multiple of 13.3x is slightly higher than its four-year average of 12.4x. Refer to Microsoft’s Valuation Ratios for additional context. We believe that Microsoft’s valuation is poised for further growth driven by strategic AI initiatives. Azure will benefit from rising enterprise AI adoption, increasing demand for cloud infrastructure, and AI platform services. Additionally, AI integration across Microsoft 365 will boost productivity, enhance user workflows and collaboration, leading to higher subscription retention and premium tier adoption. These AI features are also expected to strengthen Teams engagement, drive enterprise software licensing growth, and accelerate the shift to higher-value cloud services as businesses increasingly rely on Microsoft's comprehensive AI-powered ecosystem. Despite the strong outlook, there are notable risks. In the inflation-led 2022 downturn, MSFT stock dropped 38%, declining from a high of $343 in November 2021 to $214 in November 2022. In contrast, the S&P 500 saw a smaller decline of 25%. Although MSFT rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by June 2023, a similar sell-off occurred earlier this year amid trade war concerns, where MSFT fell nearly 20%, aligning with a 19% drawdown for the S&P 500. More on this is available in our Buy or Sell Microsoft Stock dashboard. Apart from macro and geopolitical risks, Microsoft faces internal challenges, especially regarding its significant capital expenditures. Since 2022, the company’s capital expenditures bill has crossed $144 billion. A pressing question remains: What if these large-scale investments don’t yield the expected returns? Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The tech job market is rough for entry-level workers right now. Here's how Gen Z is dodging the downtrend.

Recent years of rolling layoffs in tech have some Gen Z tech workers stressed — but not deterred. "I feel like everyone feels a bit stressed that there are layoffs," said Merc Heredia-Ferran, a 26-year-old brand marketer at Google who joined the company last year. "I get sent articles that Google laid off people that I didn't even know about, like I'm reading that in the news." The job market has hit Gen Z hard. While older millennials faced higher unemployment rates following the Great Recession compared to Gen Z now, Gen Z experiences unique challenges such as increased Big Tech cost-cutting and AI upending the workplace. BI spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z tech workers and job seekers about their experiences as they hustle to start their careers and as artificial intelligence and changing corporate and immigration policies transform early-career workers' introduction to the workplace. A SignalFire report found that entry-level hiring in Big Tech is down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels; at startups, it's down more than 30%. The percentage of graduates from top computer science programs employed at Big Tech companies has halved since 2022, the report found. As tech companies pull back hiring across the industry, it's become a tighter job market for Gen Z. The New York Fed reported that unemployment for recent college graduates who majored in computer science was 6.1%, compared to 5.8% for recent college graduates overall. Layoff concerns also weigh heavily in the tech field. Over 28% of job seekers age 18 to 24 and over 21% of those age 25 to 34 say they were laid off in their last job, a ZipRecruiter survey from the first quarter of this year found. Tech still remains a popular career choice for Gen Z in part because of its schedule flexibility, which is prioritized by 90% of graduates, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. Tech jobs often pay more compared to many other careers. "Agencies, you can be cut at any time," Heredia-Ferran said. "You don't even see it coming. Here I feel like, with the high salary, if it happens, I have a cushion now, and the Google name, I can maybe land something if it happens." A software engineer at Amazon says he "got lucky" in landing his full-time job at Amazon. When the 26-year-old India native interned at the e-commerce giant in 2023, the timing was anything but ideal: Their offer coincided with a hiring freeze. "After September 2022, Amazon just stopped hiring interns for that year," the engineer told BI. They completed their internship and received an "inclined to hire" evaluation in August 2023. Due to the freeze, they didn't start their full-time role until June 2024. Compared to the thousands of laid-off employees across tech and at Amazon, among them, peers still looking for work, they're grateful. "I can't give much advice to someone who is looking for a job. I myself can't crack exactly how I landed the job. I just got lucky in that," the engineer said. Expectations don't always match reality. Nearly 40% of rising graduates believe an internship will help them land a job, yet 9% of recent grads said their internships helped them do that, ZipRecruiter found in a 2025 survey of 3,000 recent and rising undergraduate students ZipRecruiter found that rising graduates believe they'll earn a salary of $101,500; recent grads earned an average of $68,400. "The expectation versus reality gap is quite high," said DeMase. If young workers do get the tech job they seek, a complicating factor is the growth of AI. A Hult International Business School survey found 37% of HR leaders say they'd rather use AI than hire a recent graduate. Young workers say AI has helped them and left them feeling uncertain. "In terms of work, it's gotten to a very interesting place because a lot of things that used to take me a day to do, I can now do them in one hour, but that hasn't translated into my work decreasing. It's just more work," the Amazon engineer said. "I don't know if we'll reach the point when AI is doing everything I'm doing and finally replace me," they continued with a nervous laugh. Upon graduation in 2022, Jonathan, a now 26-year-old software engineer, set about applying for tech jobs. He applied to about 300 roles and received 12 responses, some of which were coding tests, before finally landing a full-time job after three months. Nine months later, he was laid off when his tech company closed the office where he was based, meaning he was once again on the job hunt. This time, he applied to about 600 roles, and he heard back from five. "I was talking with some other former classmates and people graduating in the same year," said Jonathan, who asked to withhold his last name due to company policies on speaking with the press. "Most of us were in the same boat. We just graduated, never found anything, and had just gotten laid off from another position. We were all weighing our options. Should we go back and get our master's? It didn't seem like anyone was hiring early-level positions." Tyler Creach, a 26-year-old senior business development manager at software company Freshworks, also said she found the job market difficult before landing her role, which took about four to five months. The tech industry can be "hard to predict" for young people, and it's tough to "see yourself in it for a long time, she said. "Young people are struggling to find stable, relatively well-paying jobs," Creach said. "That's creating a lot of resentment or frustration, possibly from young people. Instead of getting a start right away, they're punting it down the line." The ZipRecruiter survey found that over half of tech job seekers age 25 to 34 and nearly 44% of those age 18 to 24 say they received zero job offers in the past month. ZipRecruiter found that a majority of job seekers in these age demographics say they've been ghosted by an employer during their job search, an experience that has become more common for Gen Z. Over 30% of them say their job search is going "poor" and over half say it's just going "fair." Creach found she had to compromise her job expectations, particularly in location. She previously had all-remote roles and ended up taking a job that required going to an office. She hopes to eventually do something more creative in her career or move into management. "Now it is super difficult to get a job for those remote roles," Creach said. "I had to think about how I could start getting more interviews. Once I started looking at more jobs based in my area, whether hybrid or fully in-office, I started to get more responses and make more progress." Jonathan landed his current job after three to four months. It did require moving states, and he now works in defense tech and not his preferred industry, video games. He says he's trying to get any experience he can. "My dad said when he graduated, it was difficult for him to find a job," Jonathan said. "In the early 90s, there was a mini-recession. To some degree, it has gotten harder over the years to land anything. Everyone tells you to get into computer science. That's where all the money is at, that's where the jobs are at. It's a lot harder than they make it out to be." Despite the job market slowdown, many Gen Z tech workers are still optimistic about working in tech. Justin Dobey, 27, pursued a master's degree in 2020 as the COVID pandemic began. After graduation, his job search just took about a month since there's a "deep lack of electrical engineers" where he lives in South Carolina. He works in a federal government engineering job that has rolled back hiring, though he hasn't been affected by cuts. Dobey said his friends with non-engineering degrees are struggling more to find work than his peers in engineering. "We might not all be in our dream jobs, but they are doing all right, last time I checked." Dobey said he's optimistic about the future of STEM jobs. "If you want to live comfortably and not want to work your whole life like, be a doctor or lawyer, get a STEM degree in computer systems, cybersecurity, AI," he said. DeMase, the ZipRecruiter career expert, said it's important for tech job seekers to learn more about AI and use it ethically. She also advises using their network, getting to know more people in the industry, and tailoring résumés to better align with target roles, which can even include skills from volunteering or part-time work "When folks think about the roles they'll apply for, it's important to lean into their strengths and target roles that are hyperaligned with their superpowers," DeMase said. She also said it's important to speak clearly about the impact they've made in their work or in their projects. "Gen Z approaches the interview as an interrogation rather than a conversation," DeMase said. "It's a conversation, not an interrogation. Come prepared to have an organic chat. Don't be afraid to remember you're interviewing as well." Jump to

He explains key philosophies, highlights pivotal moments like the "Simple Made Easy" talk, and showcases the vibrant Clojure community and its innovative tools. In this podcast, Michael Stiefel spoke with Rashmi Venugopal about two topics. The first is how the middle-tier creates the application from the raw materials in the back-end, and how the front-end uses the middle-tier to present a meaningful workflow to the user. The second is how to manage the usually inevitable software migration that results from a successful software product. AI-powered search tools often hallucinate and make up facts, misquote sources, and recycle outdated information. The real cause of this is tied to the architecture of most AI models: Transformer. In this article, author Albert Lie explains why transformers struggle with hallucinations, how State Space Models (SSMs) offer a solution, and what this shift could mean for the future of AI search.

InfoQ Homepage Articles Analyzing Apache Kafka Stretch Clusters: WAN Disruptions, Failure Scenarios, and DR Strategies Jun 20, 2025 31 min read by Srikanth Daggumalli Nishchai Jayanna Manjula reviewed by Steef-Jan Wiggers Apache Kafka is a well-known publish-subscribe distributed system widely used across industries for use cases such as log analytics, observability, event-driven architectures, and real-time streaming. Its distribution allows it to become the critical piece or backbone of modern streaming architecture, offering many integrations and supporting near-real-time or real-time latency requirements. Today, Kafka has been offered by major companies as a service, including Confluent Kafka as well as cloud offerings such as Confluent Cloud, AWS Managed Streaming Kafka , Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hub for Apache Kafka, etc. Additionally, Kafka has been deployed across over one-hundred-thousand companies, including Fortune 100 across various industry segments such as enterprise, financials, healthcare, automobile, startups, independent software vendors, and retail sectors. The value of the data diminishes over time. Many businesses these days compete in time and demand real-time data processing with millisecond responses to power mission-critical applications. Financial services, e-commerce, IoT, and other latency-sensitive industries require highly available and resilient architectures that can withstand infrastructure failures without impacting business continuity. Companies operating across multiple geographic locations need solutions that provide seamless failover, data consistency, and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities while minimizing operational complexity and cost. One of the common architectural patterns that companies often consider using is a single Kafka cluster spanning multiple data center locations on WAN (Wide Area Network). It is called Stretch Cluster. This pattern is commonly considered by companies for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA). Stretch Cluster can theoretically provide data redundancy across regions and minimize data loss in the event of a region-wide failure. However, this approach comes with several challenges and trade-offs due to the inherent nature of Kafka and its dependency on network latency, consistency, and partition tolerance in a multi-region setup. In this article, we are going to focus on the stretch cluster architectural pattern for DR or HA-related implications and considerations. The following testing has been conducted, and the cluster behavior has been documented. Below is the high-level view of a single stretch cluster setup that spans across the London and Frankfurt regions with In this use case, we have used a producer written in Java that consistently produces defined (K) Transactions Per Second (aka TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Sample snippets using Kafka performance test api. In this use case, we have used consumers written in Java that consistently consume defined (K) transactions per second (TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Before diving into further discussions and scenario executions, it's crucial to understand the fundamental algorithms of distributed systems. This foundational knowledge will help you better correlate WAN disruptions with their impact on system behavior. CAP Theorem (i.e., Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance) applies to all the distributed systems like Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, and many others, where data is being distributed across nodes to: Consistency (C) Every read gets the latest write or an error. Availability (A) Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail. Partition Tolerance (P) The system keeps working despite network issues. Kafka is an AP system; it prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, while consistency is eventual and tunable via settings. Now, let's get into the scenarios. Before going in-depth into scenarios, let's understand the key components and terminology of Kafka internals. As discussed in earlier sections, in a distributed network setup across geographic locations, network service interruptions can occur because no service guarantees 100% availability. This scenario focuses on WAN disruption between two regions, causing Kafka service unavailability, leaving the cluster with zero active controllers and no self-recovery, even after hours of waiting. Kafka is unavailable and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and reestablishment and shows active controllers as '0' It's a "brain-dead" scenario. Upon WAN disruption, a single 4-node cluster becomes 2 independent clusters, each with 2 nodes. WAN disruption can be done by deleting or modifying route tables. Warning: Deleting a route table may disrupt all traffic in the associated subnets. Instead, consider modifying or detaching the route table. You may need to shut down firewalls Firewall status: systemctl status firewalld Firewall stop: service firewalld stop ZK Server start: bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties ZK Server stop: zookeeper-server-stop ZK Shell commands: bin/zookeeper-shell.sh <zookeeper host>:2181 Active controllers check: get /controller or ls /controller Brokers list: /home/opc/kafka/bin/zookeeper-shell kafkabrokeraddress:2181 <<<"ls /brokers/ids" Alternative to check controllers and brokers in a cluster. Available from kafka 3.7.x bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh --bootstrap-server <KAFKA_BROKER>:9092 --describe-cluster Kafka is not available and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and re-establishment and shows active controllers as '2' Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own upon and showed active controllers as '0' From the logs, observed disk-related errors and exceptions Logs show that the controller moved the exception from one broker to another broker, but no exit or hang was reported in the logs Controllers '0' behavior is equal to the brain-dead scenario explained in scenario 2. Killing broker and ZK processes (an uncontrolled shutdown can be comparable with machine abrupt reboot) and restarting brokers lead to corrupted indices, rebuilding indices doesn't work even after hours of waiting. This scenario is comparable to an ungraceful shutdown during an environment upgrade or to a poor security posture, where an unauthorized person could terminate the service. Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own. From the logs, 'index corrupted' logs for partitions are shown, and also 'rebuilding indices logs'. Rebuilding indices didn't work and doesn't show any related logs on progress. The resulting cluster is in unavailable status even after 1 hour. Also, it is recommended to do graceful shutdowns instead of using the kill switch or doing abrupt shutdowns so the data in the Kafka local cache will be flushed to the disks by maintaining meta data information and also committing offsets. Deploying on-premise stretch clusters requires a deep understanding of failure scenarios, particularly during network disruptions. Unlike cloud environments, on-premises setups may lack highly available network infrastructure, fault tolerance mechanisms, or dedicated fiber lines, making them more susceptible to outages. In such cases, a Kafka cluster may experience downtime if network connectivity is disrupted. Cloud providers, on the other hand, offer high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber connections between regions and data centers. Their managed Kafka services are designed for high availability, typically recommending deployment across multiple zones or regions to withstand zonal failures. Additionally, these services incorporate zone-awareness features, ensuring Kafka data replication occurs across multiple zones, rather than being confined to a single one. It is also important to understand and emphasize the latency impact on a stretch cluster deployed in two different Geo locations with a WAN connection. We can not escape physics; in our case, as per WonderNetwork, the average latency between London and Frankfurt is 14.88 milliseconds for a distance of 636km. So, for mission-critical applications, the setup of a stretch cluster driven by latencies, through testing, is needed to determine how the data is being replicated and consumed across. By understanding these differences, organizations can make informed decisions about whether an on-premise stretch cluster aligns with their availability and resilience requirements or if a cloud-native Kafka deployment is a more suitable alternative. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is essential for any business to maintain its brand and reputation. Almost all the companies think of High Availability (HA) and Disaster recovery (DR) strategies to meet their BCP. Below are the popular DR Strategies for Kafka. Before we dive deep into DR strategies further, let's understand that the Kafka Mirror Maker 2.0 we are using in the following architectural patterns. There are other components like Kafka Connect, Replicator, etc., offered by Confluent and other cloud services, but they are out of scope for this article. DNS Redirection in Apache Kafka is a cross-cluster replication tool that uses the Kafka Connect framework to replicate topics between clusters, supporting active-active and active-passive setups. It provides automatic consumer group synchronization, offset translation, and failover support for disaster recovery and multi-region architectures. This is a popular DR strategy pattern where there will be two different Kafka clusters, which are of identical size & configuration, deployed in two different Geo regions or Data centers. In this case, it's the London and Frankfurt regions. Usually, Geo location choice depends upon Earth's different tectonic plates, company or country compliance and regulations requirements, and other factors. Out of which only one cluster is active at a given point of time, which receives and serves the clients. As shown in the following picture, Kafka cluster one (KC1) is located in the London region and Kafka cluster two (KC2) is located in the Frankfurt region with the same size and configuration. All the producers are producing data to KC1 (London region cluster), and all consumers are consuming the data from the same cluster. KC2 (Frankfurt region cluster) receives the data from the KC1 cluster through Mirror Maker as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Kafka Active Standby (aka Active Passive) cluster setup with Mirror role In simple terms, we can treat the mirror maker as a combination of producer and consumer, where it consumes the topics from the source cluster KC1 (London region) and produces the data to the destination cluster KC2 (Frankfurt region). During the disaster to the primary/active cluster KC1 (London region), the standby cluster (Frankfurt region) will become active, and all the producers and consumers' traffic redirected to the standby cluster. This can be achieved through DNS redirection via a load balancer in front of Kafka clusters. Fig 2 shows this scenario. Figure 2: Kafka Active Standby setup - Standby cluster becomes active When the London Region KC1 cluster becomes active, we need to set up a mirror maker instance to consume the data from the Frankfurt region cluster and produce back to it to the London region KC1 cluster. This scenario is shown in Fig. 3. It's up to the business to keep the Frankfurt region (KC2) active or promote the London region cluster (KC1) back to primary once the data is fully synced/hydrated to the current state. In some cases, the standby cluster, i.e., the Frankfurt region cluster (KC2), continues to function like an active cluster and the London region cluster (KC1) becomes the standby as well. It is essential to note that RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) values are high compared to the Active-Active setup. Active-standby setup cost is medium to high as we need to maintain the same Kafka clusters in both regions. Figure 3: Kafka Active Standby setup – Standby cluster data sync happening to the KC1 Kafka Mirror Maker Replication Lag (Δ): Let's take a scenario, and it might happen very rarely, where we lose all the cluster completely, including nodes and disks, etc. Where the Active Kafka Cluster (London region - KC1) has 'm' messages, and the mirror maker is consuming and producing to the standby cluster. Due to network latency or consumers & producing process with acknowledgements, the standby cluster (i.e., Frankfurt region - KC2) lags behind and holds only 'n' messages. Which means the delta(\(\Delta\)) is m minus n. \(\Delta = m - n\) where: Due to this replication lag (\(\Delta\)), it will have the following impact on mission-critical applications Potential Message Loss: If a failover occurs before the Standby cluster catches up, some messages (\(\Delta\)) may be missing. Inconsistent Data: Consumers relying on the Standby cluster may process incomplete or outdated data. Delayed Processing: Applications depending on real-time replication may experience latency in data availability. The replication lag concern can be overcome with the Active-Active setup. Just like the Active standby setup, we will have the same Kafka clusters deployed in the London and Frankfurt regions. The producers of the ingestion pipeline will write the data to both clusters at any given point in time. Which is also known as Dual Writes. So, both clusters' data is in sync as shown in Fig. 4. Please note that the ingestion pipeline or producers should have the capability to support dual writes. It is also important to note that these write pipelines should be isolated so that any issue with one cluster should not impact other pipelines or create back pressure and producer latencies. For example, if your use case is log analytics or observability, considering Logstash in your ingestion and creating two separate pipelines within a single or more Logstash instances will act as an isolated pipeline. But only one cluster is active for the consumers at any given point of time. Figure 4: Active-Active setup or Dual writes. In case, as shown in Figure 5, any issues with the one cluster the consumers need to be redirected with DNS redirect and RTO and RPO or SLAs are near zero. Figure 5: Active-Active setup, one cluster is unavailable Once the London cluster is available and becomes active, data can sync back to the London cluster from the Frankfurt cluster using Mirror Maker. As shown in Fig. 6, consumers can be switched back to the London cluster using DNS redirect. Also, it is important to configure consumer groups to start where they left off. During this setup, during the failover, it is important to configure consumers' offset to read the messages from a particular point in time, like reply messages from the last current time minus 15 mins, or set up a mirror maker between active clusters to read 'only' consumer offset topics from the London region cluster and replicate to the Frankfurt region cluster. And during the failure, you can use source.auto.offset.reset=latest to read the data from the latest offsets in the Frankfurt region cluster. If the consumer groups are not properly configured, you may see duplicate messages in your downstream system. So, it's essential to design the downstream to handle duplicate records. For example, if it's an observability use case and if the downstream is OpenSearch, it's good practice to design a unique ID depending on the message timestamp and other parameters like session IDs, etc. So, that duplicate message will overwrite the existing duplicate record and maintain only one record. Figure 6: Active-Active setup cluster syncing data with MirrorMaker Message ordering challenges occur when writing to two clusters simultaneously, messages may arrive in different orders due to network delays between regions. This can be particularly problematic for applications that require strict message ordering. So, it needs to be handled in the data processing time or downstream systems. For example, defining a primary key within the message body timestamp field would order the messages based on timestamps. Data Consistency Issues can occur while establishing dual writes to two different clusters. It requires robust monitoring and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity across clusters. Because there might be conditions where data might successfully write to one cluster but fail in another, resulting in data inconsistency. Producer complexity is an issue in this active-active setup. Producers need to handle writing to two clusters and manage failures independently for each cluster, so isolation of each pipeline is important. This setup might increase the complexity of the producer applications and require more resources to manage dual writes effectively. There are some agents or tools in the market also as open-source offerings that will provide dual pipeline options such as Elastic Logstash. Consumer group management is complex. Managing consumer offsets across multiple clusters could be challenging, especially during failover scenarios, and can lead to message duplication. Consumer applications or downstream systems need to be designed to handle duplicate messages or implement deduplication logic. Operational Overhead - Running active-active clusters requires sophisticated monitoring tools and increases operational costs significantly. Teams need to maintain detailed runbooks and conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure smooth failover processes. Network Latency Considerations- Cross-region network latency and bandwidth costs become critical factors in active-active setups. Reliable network connectivity between regions is essential for maintaining data consistency and managing replication effectively. Backup and restore is a cost-effective architectural pattern compared to Active Standby(AP) or Active Active(AA) DR architectural patterns. It is suitable for non-critical applications with higher RTO and RPO values compared to AA or AP patterns. Backup and restore is a cost-effective option because we need only one Kafka cluster. In case the Kafka cluster is unavailable, the data from the centralized repository can be replayed/restored to the Kafka cluster once it becomes available. In this architectural pattern, shown in Figure 7, all the data will be saved to a persistent location like Amazon S3 or another data lake, where the data can be restored/replayed to the Kafka cluster when the Kafka cluster is available. It is also common to see a new environment of Kafka clusters built together using terraform templates and build a new Kafka cluster and replay data. Figure 7: Backup and restore architectural pattern Recovery time impact is a major consideration; Restoring (aka replaying) large volumes of data to Kafka can take significant time, resulting in a higher RTO. This makes it suitable only for applications that can tolerate longer downtimes. Data consistency challenges are also an issue. When restoring data from backup storage like Amazon S3, maintaining the exact message ordering and partitioning as the original cluster can be challenging. Special attention is needed to ensure data consistency during restoration. Backup performance overhead is a further consideration. Regular backups to external storage can impact the performance of the production cluster. The backup process needs careful scheduling and resource management to minimize impact on production workloads. Storage is key. Managing large volumes of backup data requires effective storage lifecycle policies and controlling costs. Regular cleanup of old backups and efficient storage utilization strategies are essential. Coordination during recovery is mandatory. The recovery process requires careful coordination between backing up offset information and actual messages. Missing either can lead to message loss or duplication during restoration. As we explored earlier, choosing a DR strategy isn't one-size-fits-all, it comes with trade-offs. It often boils down to finding the right balance between what the business needs and what it can afford. The decision usually depends on several factors. SLAs (e.g., 99.99%+ uptime) are pre-defined commitments to uptime and availability. An SLA requiring 99.99% uptime allows only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year. The RTO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a failure before it causes unacceptable business harm. Knowledge/content/training systems, for example, can expect one hour or more downtime because they are not mission critical. For banking applications, on the other hand, downtime acceptance could be none or a couple of minutes. The RPO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disruptive event, measured in time from the most recent backup. For example, an observability/monitoring application can have the acceptability for losing the past hour whereas a financial application can not tolerate losing a single record of transaction data. Associated costs vary. Higher availability and faster recovery typically come at a higher price. Organizations must weigh their need for uptime and data protection against the financial investment required. References: A round-up of last week’s content on InfoQ sent out every Tuesday.

Posted by Bob Dunn There’s a myth in the tech industry that success is a straight line: get the degree, land the job, climb the ladder, maybe start a startup, and everything falls into place. But as shared by Mendel Kurland on an episode of the series DevPulse: Expanding the Stack,” the truth is anything but linear. Mendel’s story starts with a refreshingly humble admission. He failed out of college, earning what he calls a “0.52 GPA.” Instead of this being the end, it marked an unconventional new beginning. Mendel launched his first startup while scraping by, sleeping in his car with his cats, and building websites for local businesses. The drive to bounce back, hustle through uncertainty, and learn along the way became his greatest assets. Thanks to our sponsor Woo: As a shop owner or site builder, whether you’re just starting or scaling up, WooCommerce makes it simple to build and grow an online store, your way. The podcast episode revisits Mendel’s journey through major players like GoDaddy, Amazon, and DigitalOcean. But what stands out is his advice for anyone feeling stuck: “People unfortunately need resilience right now. They need hustle, and they need to reinvent themselves.” In today’s climate of restructuring and layoffs, Mendel stresses that the key to thriving is not to cling to past successes, but to be willing to try something new, even if it means starting from scratch. Mendel and the hosts emphasize an often-overlooked skill in tech: self-awareness. Whether shifting from coding to consulting, product management to community building, or even just taking a new route to an old job, regularly stepping outside routine and asking, “Does this still fit who I am?” is what separates those who thrive from those who stagnate. For Mendel, reinvention isn’t just about career pivots. It’s about re-examining what brings you fulfillment and finding ways to be useful sometimes in roles you’d never anticipated. As tech rapidly evolves, he advocates exploring adjacent paths, embracing discomfort, and connecting with community. “Progress is always forward and progress is always new,” Mendel says. The people who succeed aren’t guaranteed a path, they’re just better at finding the next one. The episode is a candid conversation about the realities of tech careers, but it’s just as much a call to action for anyone in the WordPress, WooCommerce, or broader tech ecosystem. Reinvention and resilience aren’t reserved for the rare. There are common skills we can all practice: active listening, self-analysis, and genuine curiosity. So, for anyone feeling uncertain about what’s next, remember Mendel’s story: sometimes the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and have the courage to build the future you want, even if it means starting over.

By Bob Unruh June 19, 2025 Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon, recently warned that technology, specifically artificial intelligence, will cost thousands of Americans their jobs in coming months and years. Intel, the faltering legacy tech company, confirmed that. It announced, in an email sent to employees, that it could lay off as many as one-fifth of its staff. “These are difficult actions but essential to meet our affordability challenges and current financial position of the company,” explained Naga Chandrasekaran, an executive at the Oregon-based company. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! His comments were confirmed in a report at Oregon Live. Chandrasekaran said the company is expecting cut up to 20% of its factory workers. Intel has reportedly told employees it plans to lay off 15 percent to 20 percent of workers from its chip manufacturing division, with job cuts expected in other divisions. https://t.co/xSp1oPaQFQ — Semiconductor News by Dylan Martin (@DylanOnChips) June 17, 2025 A report at the Daily Mail noted the company has about 109,000 workers globally, so the cuts could mean up to 21,800 being laid off. “It is not clear how many work in US-based factories, and how many American jobs will go,” the report said. Microsoft had confirmed only days ago it was preparing to cut thousands of jobs, and Amazon also said it was making plans for “brutal” workforce cuts, all because of AI. The Mail noted this was the second round of layoffs at Intel in just a year, after last winter’s 15% cutback. The report said the company troubles are because of upstart competitors, compounding financial losses, and a declining stock price. Chipmakers IBM, AMD, TSMC and NVIDIA have gained ground by investing in AI, the report said. Intel’s stock price was $68 in 2021, but only about $21 now. It reported a loss of $821 million during the first quarter of the year, the report said. It was Jassy who said, “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Title: Microsoft to lay off thousands in July, but don't worry, AI's getting $80 billion

In context: There's been plenty of talk about machines displacing human workers in the AI Age, mainly focusing on direct replacements – computers taking over tasks like design and programming. Meanwhile, spending on AI infrastructure soars as investment in human skills steadily declines. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft is preparing to lay off thousands of workers next month, with most of the cuts expected to hit the company's sales and customer service divisions. It's a jarring move but not an unfamiliar one in tech. What stands out this time is what Microsoft is doing with the money it's saving: pumping an estimated $80 billion into AI infrastructure over the next fiscal year. That number isn't a typo. As Microsoft reshapes its workforce, it's reshaping its balance sheet, too. It's laying off human employees while building new homes for silicon-based replacements – in hyperscale data centers, GPUs, and power-hungry server farms. Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to AI, but the connection is increasingly difficult to ignore. The company is investing heavily in machine learning capabilities across its entire product line, from Azure to Office. Its partnership with OpenAI and the widespread deployment of Copilot reflect a strategic pivot away from labor-intensive workflows and toward automated solutions. Despite the scale of this shift, Microsoft has offered little public indication that large-scale retraining or internal upskilling efforts are part of its AI strategy. The company clearly has the resources to help employees adapt to an AI-centric future, yet such initiatives are largely absent from its announcements and disclosures. The emphasis so far has been on infrastructure, partnerships, and AI product rollouts – not on preparing its broader workforce for the changes those investments will bring. This approach reflects a broader trend across the tech sector. Companies including Amazon, Duolingo, and Dropbox have all cited AI-driven efficiency gains when announcing workforce reductions. These moves often emphasize shareholder value and operational agility, even as they diminish opportunities for employees to transition into new roles within the organization. Microsoft plans to lay off thousands globally in the coming weeks. While the company has not disclosed exact figures, reports suggest a significant impact on customer-facing teams. These cuts underscore the shift away from labor-intensive roles as Microsoft pivots toward automation and AI-driven services. The contrast is stark: AI receives billions in dedicated capital, while workers get severance packages and uncertain futures. Microsoft isn't just betting on artificial intelligence – it's actively reorganizing its operations around it. This strategy may pay off in the long term, but it highlights a widening gap between investment in automation and support for displaced employees.

Title: Amazon To Cut 1,000 Jobs Due To AI. Now What?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2025/06/19/amazon-to-cut-1000-jobs-due-to-ai-now-what/

ByEli Amdur ByEli Amdur, Contributor. Giant robot flicking tiny man. Ai technologies and unemployment problem concept. Vector ... More illustration. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it would cut 1,000 jobs due to AI. Is anyone surprised? The monster created by Big Tech has begun rising up to consume its creator. Well, perhaps not totally consume, but the damage done could likely be (a) measurable, (b) a harbinger of things to come at Amazon, and (c) a phenomenon we will see far and wide, not just at Amazon. It’s inescapable for a few reasons. First, according to data from layoffs.fyi, which monitors tech worker layoffs, already this year 141 companies have laid off 62,832 employees. In 2024, it was 152,922 employees from 551 companies and in 2023, it was 264,220 employees from 1,193 companies. Layoffs, we see, are inevitable – especially in tech. At the onset of new technologies or the introduction of new products, hiring takes place with kid-in-a-candy-store concern for consequences. A year later, things look quite different – and that kid is now an obese diabetic. Now, however, we see a direct cause and effect, unmistakenly traceable to AI, because AI has advanced so quickly that it is now capable of doing many of those lower, entry-level jobs we’ve long feared it could do. I am reminded of the classic line from the 1960s comic strip Pogo: “We have met the enemy and it is us.” Make no mistake, though, this is not limited to tech jobs. In May, I posted a column here, “How AI Affects The Socioeconomic Order Of The Workplace” (5/27) and here’s what we saw: Beginner programmers and coders, data analysts, junior paralegals, retail sales associates, content writers, copy editors, graphic artists, and grant writers are among the many who will deal with this reality. There’s more, but space and time have limits here. This phenomenon of jobs being eaten by AI will undoubtedly be seen at all tech companies, as they are the creators of this to begin with. But it will spread elsewhere. Picture lava streaming down an erupting volcano. But there’s a big upside to this. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will create 78 million jobs, even after job losses are factored in. So, working the math and going with aggregated and widely-accepted estimations that for every job killed by AI three or four will be created, we come to this: 78 million is the WEF’s net number, bringing us to 100 million or more, gross. Thise jobs will just not be the vulnerable entry-level jobs we’ve been discussing here. It’s complicated, no? If I were running a large company, I’d ask for a meeting. In the same room, I’d have the president of the local university or community college, my senator or congressperson, and me. I’d have one item on the agenda: those AI skills we’ve been teaching for our graduates to find their first jobs need to be relegated to high school and forever be seen as obsolete. AI will forever do them. Next, define the next level of AI jobs and teach them as the new entry level, while teaching other skills – communication, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. – that our new employees would have been developing on he way up. We are past throwing our hands in the air. This is no longer something new or mysterious. “Success delayed is success denied,” said Ben Franklin. We just simply must take the first step.

Title: The Big Picture: Streaming and Social Media Climb Amid Traditional Media’s Slow-Motion Breakdown
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/streaming-social-media-impact-on-traditional-news/
Time Published: 2025-06-19T17:00:00Z

The headlines all point toward the decline of linear and traditional models, with the nagging question of whether new means of distribution can pick up the slack Traditional media is experiencing what often feels like a slow-motion nervous breakdown, which would hardly come as news to anyone operating in the thick of that. Yet occasionally a week comes along with ostensibly distinct stories that help crystallize the larger picture, almost like the cop finally piecing things together at the end of “The Usual Suspects.” In just the last few days, a handful of reports speak to trends that coalesce into a single clarifying moment: Old media is limping along on wobbly legs, if not its death bed yet, and efforts to save it are merely prolonging the inevitable. A shift in consumption patterns for entertainment, news and information has hamstrung many long-established means of disseminating content, while pushing newer forms to the forefront. Clocking each of these developments as they fly by — sometimes while on the move ourselves, increasingly via our phones — the connections aren’t always obvious. So let’s pause for a breath and take inventory of this week’s media news, and the changing of the guard that it reveals. Part of that shift has been driven by YouTube, and as if on cue: Shorter version: Teens and young adults (especially) are spending less time watching movies and TV shows, while allocating more to snippets of video and getting their news from TikTok, not those stodgy cable networks watched by their parents and grandparents. But wait, there’s more. Netflix unveiled a groundbreaking deal Wednesday to carry the output from French broadcaster TF1, an agreement TF1 Group CEO Rodolphe Belmer described in its announcement as becoming necessary “as viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases” — a trend that has crossed international borders. Finally, Amazon issued a memo that served as a not-so-subtle warning to its employees about the impact of artificial intelligence, noting there will be layoffs associated with AI picking up tasks performed by actual humans, while offering the only modestly reassuring aside that some new jobs will be created as a byproduct of that shift. So basically, “Get on board, or get out of the way.” Although frankly, a host of recent headlines have made clear AI’s impact remains unpredictable enough that it won’t necessarily spare early adopters either, in the same way monsters in old movies frequently kill the mad scientist that unleashes them first. The main problem, grappled with since the transition from print to online and more recently the great migration to streaming that began with the launch of multiple services (including Disney+ and Apple TV+) in 2019, is the uncertainty about when these lines will intersect — whether newer revenue streams can supplant old ones, such as linear TV, before those models slide off a cliff. The newspaper industry dealt with that game of digital chicken first, as the web gobbled up its classified advertising business and distribution of print editions, falling victim to those forces despite the alarm bells sounded about trading in “print dollars for digital dimes.” Although most legacy publications have managed to survive, with a few notable exceptions like the New York Times, it’s generally in dramatically scaled-down form, both in terms of the size of their staffs and the scope of their ambitions. Step back a little further, and it’s easy to weave more pixels into the picture, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal’s spinoffs of their declining cable assets, and whether the economies of scale associated with mergers and acquisitions can be enough to justify anteing up for an entity whose trend lines point in the wrong direction. In “The Usual Suspects,” the messy cop defends his scattered work area by telling a colleague, “It all makes sense when you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.” In the daily scramble of these jobs, including the race to cover these stories, it can be difficult to take the time to seek perspective or try connecting the dots, making things appear messier, even chaotic. Whether the view is from up close or gains clarity from far away, though, the prospects for traditional media don’t paint a comforting picture.

Title: How Online Businesses Are Winning Customers With AI Agents In 2025

ByAytekin Tank ByAytekin Tank, Contributor. Photo by Christopher Gower on Unsplash If you scroll through Instagram stories these days, you might notice something: photos of vacations, engagements, and kids’ birthdays are giving way to targeted ads. They’re not there just to spam you—they actually work. The old shopping journey looked like this: need → search → buy. Today, that flow has flipped. People often make purchases without ever intending to shop in the first place. Using the latest technologies, brands match products to individuals, and customers end up buying things they didn’t even know they needed, like a lightweight enamel mug for that camping trip you just booked. Now, AI agents are pushing the next big shift in e-commerce. These tools promise to transform the customer journey yet again. Brands that don’t get on board risk losing valuable opportunities (and sales). The fact is: consumer expectations are evolving. By 2030, over 55% of purchases will be influenced by AI-friendly buyers, according to research from Cognizant. As CEO of a company that builds AI agents—and uses them internally—I’ve seen how powerful they can be. Here’s how your business can tap into them to boost sales and level up the customer experience. Many years ago, when I built my first website, adding e-commerce functionality was a Byzantine process. I needed an experienced web developer to help hammer out the details. Today, platforms like Shopify make it easy and affordable for businesses of any size to sell online. And now, AI agents are making customizable storefronts even more accessible. When you install an agent like Juphy, Smartbot, or Shopify Sidekick, it will train itself using your business’s data. You can decide what the agent does and how it interacts with customers. If you want it to handle customer service, you can assign it a support phone number and instruct it to answer calls. If your business serves multiple countries, your agent can translate webpages and offer support in different languages. You can also choose which pop-ups to display to guide users as they browse and shop. What’s more, you can set it all up without writing a single line of code. A growing number of startups are taking the guesswork out of visual design as well. Phot.AI, for example, is an agent platform that independently handles tasks like image editing and design for e-commerce brands. Its agents learn which designs perform best for different product categories and marketplaces, reducing manual effort and costs for business owners by up to 80%. AI agents are like designing the brick-and-mortar store of your dreams, but without needing an architect or interior designer. AI agents make it easier than ever to design and customize your e-commerce site. But what about the experience on the other side of the screen? Research shows that 75% of buyers find online shopping frustrating. If you’ve ever sworn off e-commerce after a botched return or an endless gift search, you’re not alone. Maybe the shoes you ordered for a wedding arrived two sizes too big, and the return process was cumbersome. Or perhaps you set out to buy your nephew a birthday present and got lost down the rabbit hole of Nintendo Switch options. This is where AI-powered assistants come in. Agents can guide shoppers step-by-step, smoothing over the snags that often jam up the purchase journey. They answer questions, like what to buy, when it will arrive, and whether it fits the budget. And over time, they learn a buyer’s preferences: goals, timing, history, and price sensitivity. For instance, if you need that present for your 12-year-old nephew by Friday, an agent will intuit that a digital gift card to his favorite gaming store, delivered instantly, is the best option. Even if the product search has gone off without a snag, one glitch in the process, like a question or concern that pops up and doesn’t receive immediate attention, can mar the entire experience. As Scott Hendrickson, chief revenue officer of the agentic AI merchant network firmly, recently noted, “What consumers really want is for commerce to happen immediately. People’s time has never been more valuable, and they expect things to be frictionless.” Integrating AI agents into your e-commerce site can help transactions become frictionless. Agents are ready to answer questions around the clock, 24/7. An agent can engage in natural, responsive, human-sounding conversations, ensuring potential customers never slip through the cracks due to unanswered calls. And because they are linked directly to the back-end of your business—data, inventory, and more—you can rest assured that the information it provides will be up-to-date. It won’t offer unrealistic shipping timelines, only to frustrate disappointed customers. It won’t suggest products that aren’t in stock. But if a product is out of stock, it will suggest alternatives based on the buyer’s preferences and history. And as your business grows, agents are a cost-effective solution to help manage all of the business parts that grow in tandem, like more products, more customers, and a higher volume of transactions. In short, AI agents help scale your business, ensuring every customer interaction is fast, informed, and friction-free.

Title: Microsoft Plans Layoffs Targeting Sales Teams

Microsoft is gearing up for another round of layoffs, with plans to cut thousands of jobs with a specific focus on its sales workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg reports that technology giant Microsoft is preparing to trim its workforce once again, with the latest round of job cuts expected to be announced in early July, following the close of the company’s fiscal year. Sources close to the situation revealed that the layoffs will predominantly impact sales positions, although other teams may also be affected. The exact timing of the announcement could still change. This news comes on the heels of a previous wave of layoffs in May, which involved 6,000 employees losing their jobs, primarily in product and engineering roles. The customer-facing positions, such as sales and marketing, were largely spared during that round of cuts. In April, Microsoft informed employees of its intention to rely more heavily on third-party firms for the sale of software to small and medium-sized businesses, potentially foreshadowing the upcoming reductions in the sales force. As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, spending tens of billions of dollars on servers and data centers, executives have pledged to Wall Street and cautioned employees that the company will maintain a tight grip on spending in other areas. The company has stated that it regularly assesses its organizational structure to ensure it is allocating resources effectively for growth. At the end of June 2024, Microsoft had a total of 228,000 employees, with 45,000 of them working in sales and marketing positions. The company has a history of restructuring teams and announcing other organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. Breitbart News previously reported on a significant layoff in January that impacted the company’s security division: One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort.

Title: I'm a former Amazon developer. Jassy's memo doesn't surprise me, and I don't think engineers should worry about their jobs.

Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 30-year-old Shahad Ishraq, from Germany. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Reading Andy Jassy's new memo on generative AI, I'm not surprised by anything. I worked at Amazon for nearly 3 ½ years and left in late May because of the five-day return-to-office mandate. My commute took an hour and a half each way, so I wanted to move to another job where I could still see my career progressing and do interesting work. The memo feels consistent with what I'd been hearing from management and Jassy while working at Amazon. I think Jassy's comments are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. I initially worried about AI when I wasn't as familiar with the products. However, using AI will give you a better understanding of what it's capable of and what skills you can develop to differentiate yourself. I joined Amazon in 2022 as a systems development engineer, working in Leipzig, Germany. My day-to-day work involved designing and implementing software and performing operational tasks. When AI tools first came out a few years ago, we were told we could use them, but we should be very careful and follow the company's policies on their usage. Amazon is a huge company. Within it, I spotted and heard about different approaches to AI adoption. There seemed to be a bunch of excited early adopters who shared their findings with everyone. There were people like me who followed the first bunch and saw what went well. There were also some skeptics and a small number of engineers who were outright against using AI. For me, the dawn of AI was a bit scary at first. Everyone was saying it would put me out of a job. Unless you test the technology yourself and see what it can do, you'll fear the unknown. AI wasn't part of my job until sometime in 2024. There were also some barriers to using the technology. When I first joined Amazon, ChatGPT wasn't even available, but when it did come out in 2022, we couldn't use it that extensively because of data security issues that come with copying our code into those models. When Anthropic's Claude became available within Amazon Bedrock — the company's internal service for developing generative AI applications — we were able to make more use of AI. In my last few months at Amazon, I started experimenting a lot with approved AI tools, doing extensive tests with them. They don't do everything for me, but I've integrated these tools into my workflow, such as by asking it to create a plan for my tasks or spot differences between documents. I noticed it often fails, and I have to make changes, but overall, it has improved my speed and increased my throughput significantly. Andy Jassy's memo feels very consistent with what I've been told internally before I left Amazon and what the company has communicated publicly. News articles talking about the memo focus on Jassy saying that a lot of jobs will be taken by AI. However, in the same sentence, he also says jobs will be created. I've tried creating production-level applications using AI, and it takes a lot of effort to get these products ready. A company like Amazon can't roll out an application that breaks and causes havoc. They have to have firewalls, checks, and tests. I don't see people going out of jobs in huge numbers soon. Amazon went on a hiring spree during COVID. If we see more layoffs, I think it will be associated with cutting back after that spree, rather than the impacts of AI. AI agents are helping out software engineers a lot, and the amount of work agents do will probably increase gradually. I'm able to get agents working on three different things, while I look into other tasks. But AI hallucinates quite a lot. It does things it's not asked to do. I often have to correct an AI agent producing code. Humans will be required to build guardrails and act as guardrails themselves. Implementing these guardrails will take time, and I think this will slow down the AI agent hype. I think Jassy's comments about AI are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. Memos have to come out. Jassy has to place a lot of optimism around AI; otherwise, shareholders will think they're not doing anything with AI. My advice to Amazon employees is to start using AI as much as possible to overcome their fear of the unknown. I now work as a software engineer at a utilities company. The more I've been using AI, the more comfortable I feel about myself. I can see what skills I have that I can use to stay relevant. In tech, languages and developments come really fast. My guess is that people will need to use AI to write code and increase their throughput, and pure software engineers will gradually be replaced by people who have both software engineering and AI skills. I'm personally trying to learn these skills because I think they'll become more important. A spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider: "Amazon employees use internal generative AI tools every day to innovate on behalf of our customers. We have safeguards in place for employee use of these technologies, including restrictions on sharing confidential information with third-party generative AI services."

Title: Amazon is apparently forcing some workers to relocate to its main office hubs

Amazon workers are being reminded of the company's RTO mandate When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is requiring some corporate workers to relocate closer to their managers and teams, including boosting office occupancy across key sites like Seattle, Arlington and Washington DC (via Bloomberg). The report notes thousands of employees could be forced to move from across various teams, however the company's famously vocal workers are understandably frustrated with the decision. Amazon has been reassessing where employees work for several months, with the company's leader publicly advocating for office-based working. Although relocating isn't always a problem for new starters, many mid-career workers are hesitant to move due to personal and financial challenges – a move would mean uprooting families, children switching schools and partners seeking other jobs. The report suggests that workers have 30 days to decide, followed by a 60-day period to relocate or resign. It also claims that those who refuse to relocate will not be receiving severance packages. Amazon contested this, adding that teammates will receive relocation support, and that timelines for relocations could vary by case. Amazon's relocation trend has already been ongoing for more than a year, with CEO Andy Jassy previously claiming that in-person working boost ad-hoc interactions and, therefore, productivity. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! "We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," Jassy said. Amazon now requires workers to come to the office five days per week, but that policy got delayed at the end of 2024 due to a lack of readiness – there simply weren't enough desks. "We hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances," a company spokesperson stated. Some workers worry that the policy shift could be an effort to push workers away from the company – although thousands lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023, Amazon's layoffs in the years that followed have been relatively small (compared with other giants in the industry). An Amazon spokesperson stressed that the policy is not new, but that it's taking a team-by-team approach to in-office working, and that relative to the number of workers the company has overall, the proportion affected is small.

Microsoft is set to cut thousands of jobs, mainly in sales, amid growing fears that AI advances are accelerating the replacement of human roles across the industry, Bloomberg reports. The cuts follow a previous round in May, which saw approximately 6,000 roles eliminated. Microsoft has been ramping up its AI investments to strengthen its position as enterprises across industries rush to integrate the technology into their operations. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend around $80 billion in fiscal 2025, largely on building data centers to support AI training and cloud-based applications. Adding to industry unease, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week that generative AI and AI agents are expected to shrink the company’s corporate workforce over time. AI is being used as an excuse for layoffs this year, but there may be more to it than what meets the eye. “One, we are still rebalancing employee counts from the over-hiring of the past decade,” said Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst of Amalgam Insights. “Tech companies were hiring with the assumption that they would grow at ridiculous rates that have not come to pass. Also, some tech companies think they can simply get rid of salespeople, especially in cash-cow industries where renewals seem to come in with little to no effort. Whether that is actually true or not, we are about to find out.”The job cuts may also signal concerns about the near-term revenue potential of AI, Park said. While Microsoft is under pressure to invest heavily in AI to sustain its stock valuation, it may be turning to short-term operating expense reductions to support its financial performance. “The planned $80 billion investment in AI infrastructure is especially interesting because those numbers assume a massive number of people will adopt Microsoft-related AI products,” Park said. “Are 50 million+ people willing to pay an additional amount on Microsoft products to support AI? That is a massive bet that has been completely unjustified by the current AI market today.”Others point out that the company is betting on a long-term inflection in enterprise workload patterns driven by GenAI, but current adoption patterns remain volatile. “Reports of Microsoft pausing or renegotiating data center leases reflect a prudent but necessary response to these uncertainties,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “If workloads fail to scale or regulatory barriers increase, Microsoft, and by extension, other hyperscalers, could face underutilized infrastructure, prompting pricing recalibrations or service tier stratification.” The focus on sales roles in the planned cuts is notable, with analysts saying it reflects a broader shift in how enterprise sales functions are evolving. “The rise of AI copilots, telemetry-rich self-service portals, and data-driven journey mapping is reducing the need for large in-region sales teams,” Gogia said. “Microsoft’s realignment is part of a broader pattern also visible in Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.” However, while AI can personalize interactions at scale, it lacks the relational depth required in strategic deal-making, compliance negotiation, and multi-stakeholder orchestration, Gogia added.

Title: Microsoft Reportedly Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs Next Month

Microsoft is planning to cut thousands of jobs in the next few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the plans. Details about the layoffs are scarce, but Bloomberg says it will be announced early next month once Microsoft’s fiscal year ends. The cuts will impact multiple departments, but Microsoft's sales team is expected to take the biggest hit. The report arrives just a month after Microsoft removed 6,000 jobs across various departments and seniority levels. It was done to reduce management layers and “best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft said at the time. As of June 2024, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, and 45,000 of them were in sales and marketing. According to Bloomberg, the previous round of layoffs had largely left the sales and marketing teams untouched. In April, however, the company informed employees that it plans to use third-party firms for the marketing of software to small and mid-size customers. This strategy could help Microsoft reduce operational costs by relying on gig workers for short-term campaigns instead of full-time staff. Microsoft has also vowed to invest over $80 billion in data centers for AI development, but it’s unclear if that has anything to do with the back-to-back layoffs. The months ahead may be tough for tech workers, with more layoffs looming across major firms. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just announced that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer. Intel is also planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2025/06/19/the-2025-forbes-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio. Over the past year, and as the category continues to shift and respond to forces ranging from changing consumption behaviors amongst younger generations to tariffs, Diezhandino has reorganized her global team into agile brand communities built for experimentation and speed. Over the past year, to accelerate brand and volume growth in the premium sector, Diezhandino has launched the Diageo Luxury Group to unify its high-end spirits portfolio and drive brand and strategic consistency globally. She has also introduced a virtual studio to better scale content and creative production, while also leading Diageo’s largest-ever consumer data initiative and establishing a global partnerships lab to unlock untapped growth through cultural collaborations. Guided by a mindset of possibility and a belief in progress over perfection, Diezhandino is reshaping how her teams understand and influence the future of socializing, long a category reference point, placing celebrations and cultural relevance at the center of every brand experience. Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories. While Nike continues to face headwinds, recent campaigns have fueled renewed consumer engagement and helped slow its stock’s decline following years of erosion under previous leadership. In Q2 FY25, the company beat earnings expectations and maintained strong margins, signaling early momentum in its turnaround strategy.

Focused on driving increased brand strength and creative innovation, the company now delivers personalized, real-time content, powering global efforts like the 2025 return of “Share a Coke,” refreshed for Gen Z, and large-scale activations across Asia-Pacific for Lunar New Year. Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally.

Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces.

She is also helping shape how LVMH’s maisons respond to macroeconomic turbulence, empowering each brand to lean into creating desirability and distinction and never discounting. Her work is less about uniformity and more about cultivating excellence through shared creative intelligence, enabling legacy brands like Dior and established acquisitions like Tiffany & Co. to evolve without losing their identity. Esi Eggleston Bracey Eggleston Bracey oversees marketing for a global portfolio of more than 400 brands—including icons like Dove, Hellmann’s, and Magnum—for the world’s fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company. With a remit spanning marketing, innovation and category growth, Eggleston Bracey’s influence is central to Unilever’s shift toward building brands that sit at the intersection of personal care, wellness and sustainability. Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon.

A new global brand platform, and the work of bringing it to life, emphasize the Indian multinational’s commitment to trustworthy, responsible innovation. This is an especially pointed stance as generative AI continues to shake industries, practices and, in some instances, confidence across sectors. Beyond positioning the enterprise for growth, Virmani is scaling the company’s presence in cultural arenas that intersect with its tech-forward ethos.

Announced last year as the official business and technology partner of the NFL, Kramer and Accenture highlighted the intersection of human potential and cutting-edge technology, helping reinforce the company’s position as a transformation partner to some of the world’s most ambitious organizations. For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Körber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Körber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Körber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Körber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6th, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion.

Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY.

Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index.

Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories.

Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally.

Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces.

With a remit spanning marketing, innovation and category growth, Eggleston Bracey’s influence is central to Unilever’s shift toward building brands that sit at the intersection of personal care, wellness and sustainability. Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon.

She’s expanded Stubios—Tubi’s incubator for underrepresented creators—with new mentorship tracks and original short-form content, and led genre experimentation across the platform, tapping into niche communities through data-driven programming and culturally specific campaigns that speak directly to underserved audiences. In the past year, her team also activated high-impact tentpole moments around everything from horror drops to Black cinema, amplifying Tubi’s brand voice through partnerships, audience-resonant stunts, and social-first storytelling. Under her marketing leadership, Tubi’s monthly active users grew from 50 million (2022) to 100 million (as of June 2025), and the streamer now commands a greater percentage of total U.S. TV viewing time than Max, Peacock and Pluto TV. As the audience has grown, so have ad revenues, up 10% YoY for FY24. Jill Kramer With a remit spanning brand, advertising, content, media, sponsorships and performance marketing, Kramer leads a global team of more than 2,000 marketers for the world’s largest consulting firm by revenue and one of the largest and most influential operations in professional services. In an era defined by disruption, Kramer’s influence cuts across the firm and its clients. Over the past year, she has continued evolving the firm’s “Let There Be Change” platform and introducing AI-powered creative tools that deliver dynamic storytelling tailored to industries, clients and cultures worldwide. She’s also elevated Accenture’s cultural visibility with strategic media integrations and high-profile partnerships—like its World Economic Forum activations, featuring immersive demonstrations of responsible AI and sustainability at work. Announced last year as the official business and technology partner of the NFL, Kramer and Accenture highlighted the intersection of human potential and cutting-edge technology, helping reinforce the company’s position as a transformation partner to some of the world’s most ambitious organizations. For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Körber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Körber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Körber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Körber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6th, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors.

Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion.

Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are.

His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio.

Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories.

In Q2 FY25, the company beat earnings expectations and maintained strong margins, signaling early momentum in its turnaround strategy.

Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally.

Over the past year, Delhoume-Debreu played a pivotal role in activating the Group’s unexpected and pioneering Paris 2024 Olympics sponsorship, transforming the Olympics into a global luxury showcase and bringing its “Art of Crafting Dreams” ethos to life through headline-making moments like Dior-designed performance outfits, Louis Vuitton-crafted medal trays, and Moët Hennessy activations across hospitality spaces. Just as influential is her commitment to innovation and sustainability, and her leadership of the LVMH Innovation Award. She is also helping shape how LVMH’s maisons respond to macroeconomic turbulence, empowering each brand to lean into creating desirability and distinction and never discounting. Her work is less about uniformity and more about cultivating excellence through shared creative intelligence, enabling legacy brands like Dior and established acquisitions like Tiffany & Co. to evolve without losing their identity.

Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon.

Ulrich-Klenke Klenke oversees global brand strategy, marketing communications and media, and is shaping one of the world’s most valuable telecommunications brands into a cultural force grounded in purpose, clarity and emotion. Under his marketing leadership and company influence, the German company has taken bold stances on social issues, most recently with the 2025 “Against Hate on the Net” campaign featuring Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer, which reaffirmed the company’s human-centered approach to brand-building. He’s also sharpened Telekom’s presence at the intersection of media, sport, and technology: MagentaTV has secured exclusive rights to all matches in the 2026 Men’s and 2027 Women’s FIFA World Cups, backed by German household-name presenters Johannes B. Kerner and Wolff Fuss. Klenke has prioritized storytelling that resonates across Europe while maintaining a unified global identity, enabling the brand to stand for something greater than connectivity. Deutsche Telekom’s brand value surged 44% year-over-year in the 2025 Kantar BrandZ ranking, making it not only the most valuable German brand, but the top-ranked telco brand worldwide. Nicole Parlapiano Parlapiano’s influence has helped transform Tubi, part of FOX, into the most-watched free streaming service in the U.S. With creative courage and a viewer-first mindset, Parlapiano is creating new standards in the streaming space, redefining how and where a modern media brand engages its audiences. Over the past year, she’s amplified Tubi’s disruptive brand identity through risk-taking campaigns that treat marketing as entertainment, not interruption. She’s expanded Stubios—Tubi’s incubator for underrepresented creators—with new mentorship tracks and original short-form content, and led genre experimentation across the platform, tapping into niche communities through data-driven programming and culturally specific campaigns that speak directly to underserved audiences. In the past year, her team also activated high-impact tentpole moments around everything from horror drops to Black cinema, amplifying Tubi’s brand voice through partnerships, audience-resonant stunts, and social-first storytelling. Under her marketing leadership, Tubi’s monthly active users grew from 50 million (2022) to 100 million (as of June 2025), and the streamer now commands a greater percentage of total U.S. TV viewing time than Max, Peacock and Pluto TV. As the audience has grown, so have ad revenues, up 10% YoY for FY24. Jill Kramer With a remit spanning brand, advertising, content, media, sponsorships and performance marketing, Kramer leads a global team of more than 2,000 marketers for the world’s largest consulting firm by revenue and one of the largest and most influential operations in professional services. In an era defined by disruption, Kramer’s influence cuts across the firm and its clients. Over the past year, she has continued evolving the firm’s “Let There Be Change” platform and introducing AI-powered creative tools that deliver dynamic storytelling tailored to industries, clients and cultures worldwide. She’s also elevated Accenture’s cultural visibility with strategic media integrations and high-profile partnerships—like its World Economic Forum activations, featuring immersive demonstrations of responsible AI and sustainability at work. Announced last year as the official business and technology partner of the NFL, Kramer and Accenture highlighted the intersection of human potential and cutting-edge technology, helping reinforce the company’s position as a transformation partner to some of the world’s most ambitious organizations. For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Körber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Körber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Körber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Körber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6th, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round.

Title: Microsoft reportedly set to cut thousands of jobs, with sales roles particularly at risk

Microsoft is warming up for more redundancies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is preparing to cut thousands of jobs as part of its ongoing cost-cutting shakeup as the company continues to spend big on AI. A new Bloomberg report says if confirmed, the layoffs could be announced in early July after the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year end on June 30, 2025. Sales teams could be the worst affected, but the redundancies could span other departments as Microsoft looks to reduce employment-related expenses. The company has already cut thousands of workers off in these post-pandemic years. In May 2025, it cut 6,000 of its workers, equating to around 3% of its roughly 228,000 headcount, in an effort to reduce inefficiencies by removing middle management tiers. A further 305 workers lost their jobs this month, with 14,000 roles affected in 2023 and 2024. In April 2025, Microsoft said it would outsource sales to small and mid-sized customers to third-party firms – an indication of the changes believed to be coming as soon as next month. Despite widespread job losses, Microsoft continues to perform well financially. Last quarter, it reported a 13% increase in revenue to $70.1 billion. It currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.569 trillion. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! At the time, CFO Amy Hood stated that overall company headcount was 2% up year-over-year, but slightly down quarter-over-quarter, suggesting constant fluctuations. TechRadar Pro has asked Microsoft to confirm plans to lay off workers after the current quarter draws to a close, but we did not receive an immediate response. While highly disappointing for the company's workers, Microsoft employees aren't alone in facing job uncertainty. Key rivals like Amazon and Google have also been making regular adjustments to their headcounts to optimize costs and output.

Title: Report: Microsoft to Lay Off Thousand of Employees Early Next Month

Microsoft is reportedly planning to lay off thousands of employees early next month following the closure of its 2025 fiscal year. According to a report from Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter, the layoffs will mostly impact sales team, though the timing of the announcement could still change. In May, Microsoft already laid off 3 percent of its workforce, with the job cuts affecting approximately 6,000 people. In January, the company also laid off employees working on security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming.

"*" indicates required fields Δ It’s not uncommon for Microsoft to axe jobs or sunset unprofitable services at the beginning of a new fiscal year. Currently, the company is also investing heavily in developing its AI infrastructure, and it is on track to spend over $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s recent job cuts in May primarily affected software engineers, as up to 30% of the code for some of the company’s projects is now being written by AI. And the Redmond giant isn’t the only Big Tech company to reduce its workforce amid the ongoing AI boom. In a note to employees shared on Tuesday (via the Wall Street Journal), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI developments will force the company to adapt its structure in the coming years. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: Microsoft planning thousands more job cuts aimed at salespeople: Sources

NEW YORK – Microsoft is planning to axe thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, as part of the company’s latest move to trim its workforce amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence. The cuts are expected to be announced early in July, following the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions will not exclusively affect sales teams, and the timing could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. The company declined to comment. The terminations would follow a previous round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people and fell hardest on product and engineering positions, largely sparing customer-facing roles like sales and marketing. In April, Microsoft told employees it planned to use third-party firms to handle more sales of software to small and mid-size customers. The tech giant has ramped up its investments in AI, aiming to solidify its leadership as companies across industries accelerate the integration of AI into their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said on June 17 that the roll-out of generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years. Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion (S$102.8 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The company had 228,000 workers at the end of June 2024, 45,000 of them in sales and marketing. Microsoft often restructures teams and announces other changes near the end of its fiscal year, which closes in June.
