Nvidia invests $20 billion to license Groq's AI technology and hire its leadership. The deal is a strategic move to counter Google's growing influence in AI inference hardware. Structuring it as a licensing agreement aims to avoid intense antitrust scrutiny. Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The deal is a strategic move to counter Google's growing influence in AI inference hardware.

Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. In a move that reshapes the battlefield of artificial intelligence hardware, chip giant Nvidia has strategically deployed a massive $20 billion to secure the technology and brains behind a key startup, Groq. This deal, structured as a licensing agreement and talent acquisition, represents Nvidia's largest such transaction ever and is a direct response to rising competition, particularly from Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs). For those watching the high-stakes race for AI inference supremacy, this is a clear signal that the arms race is accelerating, with Nvidia pulling out its checkbook to maintain its edge. The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount. Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate.

Title: A 'jobless boom' is shaping up to be the story of the 2026 economy

The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs. Hot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a "Great Freeze." As KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, "Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled." It's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a "jobless boom." Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you. Instead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and "do more with less" has been the mantra of the year. "Firms are doing more with fewer workers," Swonk wrote. "Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels more in line with demand. Others are offsetting the squeeze on profit margins due to tariffs with layoffs and hiring freezes." Economists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts. Business Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt "impossible," and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life. In addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread. This suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty. The tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow. Dozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job. In his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for "ROI for AI." "I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects," he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year. If that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market. Although it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the "Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead." Still, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains. Jump to

Title: India Inc 2026: Hinterland hiring, gig growth and AI disruption

Dear reader, as 2025, a year of global tumult and volatility, rolls by, Mint's reporters and columnists look around the corner on what is coming in 2026—to help you know what to expect and prepare for it. Tell us what you think at feedback@livemint.com. The Chinese zodiac predicts that 2026 will be the Year of the Fire Horse, symbolizing bold decisions, ambition and sharply moving away from the strategic thinking that was 2025, the Year of the Wood Snake. For both the employer and the employee in India Inc, there will be three prominent trends, says experts. The spotlight will shift to smaller cities and towns as companies look for the right talent and metros lose their lure. The second change will be the dominant role that the gig workforce will play. Thirdly, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) will remain an integral aspect of the workplace in the coming year with concerns on how to upskill employees without letting go of the high performers. About 18 months ago, recruitment firm CIEL HR opened a hiring hub in Patna where 25 recruiters scout for talent from neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Odisha states and the smaller towns of Bihar. The aim was to cater to the hiring needs of retail, financial services, consumer goods, and manufacturing clients. A similar hub was created earlier in Mysuru in Karnataka as well to tap into IT talent. “The demand from smaller towns will grow because the total cost of hiring and retaining an employee is 5-10% lower in the longer run for companies as those who migrate can be held onto for a longer period than those who are from the larger metros with their offices and homes in the same city,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, managing director and chief executive officer of CIEL HR. The total cost of hiring denotes the overall financial implications of an employee during one's tenure. In this case, it will include investments in upskilling the employee and how their productivity impacts the firm. Mishra pointed out that companies have started employing a blended workforce where a major chunk will be from the same city, 20-25% from nearby towns and the rest from other states. This is largely in the case of temporary staffing, where the employee works at the client's site but will be on the payrolls of the vendor. Over the past couple of years, staffing firms found it difficult to get workers for the peak sale period (August-December) as the workforce demanded higher wages for relocation to the larger cities. A similar challenge will continue in the coming year. Cost pressures on companies will force more gig hiring across the skillset spectrum. Until now, the spurt in gig hiring would come on the back of festive season recruitment, but with the implementation of the labour codes, the benefits for gig workers are cemented. Online food delivery, e-commerce and quick-commerce companies will now have to allocate up to 2% of their annual turnover for the welfare of gig and platform workers. In November, the ministry of labour and employment announced that with the new reforms, all workers would get benefits such as retirement savings via provident fund, coverage under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, other insurance and social security benefits. Therefore, there will be a larger number of the informal workforce aiming to enter the gig economy. While on a vendor's payroll, gig workers take up short-term projects that could be for a few hours or days and they can work across platforms. Dark stores, retail and logistics are some of the segments that hire gig workers on a large scale. The country’s gig workforce is projected to grow from 10 million in 2024-25 to 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to a Press Information Bureau note on 30 August. "Gig will continue to grow in scale as more people will be eager to join this workforce after new labour codes giving them the social security cover along with blue collar and even white-collar gig roles will scale up," said Lohit Bhatia, CEO-designate for Quess Corp. Blue-collared workers are typically employed in the automotive and manufacturing sector while white-collared find a job in services. In 2025, companies including Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta retrenched employees, citing AI. Companies are in a flux as they scamper to upskill employees on the latest in technology. They are hiring candidates who have the prowess on AI and at the same time, letting go of those who are in the bottom rung of the skillsets. There is a stress that has built up across industries and will play out in the coming year as well. "I do not expect AI’s impact on workplaces to stabilize or 'calm down' after the layoffs we saw in 2025. The 2025 layoffs were not only about cost-cutting – they were about restructuring work around AI systems. In 2026, in my view, that process will deepen," said Rohini Lakshane, a technologist and researcher. Lakshane said companies will have to take note of how they inform and discuss with their workforce the changes in profiles because of AI. “Jobs will not vanish in waves, but they will be hollowed out, with fewer people doing more work, assisted and monitored by AI. Tasks within roles will be automated, recombined or shifted. If that is done without clear communication to workers, it creates insecurity even when employment technically continues," Lakshane said. With increased automation, the pressure on employees will go up as well. "Workers who can design, audit or manage AI systems will remain in demand. For highly skilled professionals, especially in technology and analytics, 2026 will look calmer on the surface, but expectations might rise sharply. Fewer people doing more work, assisted by AI tools, with thinner margins for error," said Lakshane. Ironically, India Inc is one of the swiftest to adopt AI in its teams. According to an EY report covering 50 employers and 800 employees, about 62% use GenAI at work regularly, whereas 90% of the employers and 86% of the employees believe that AI impacts productivity positively. The study noted that 75% of the employees and 72% of the employers believe that GenAI enhances decision making, 82% of the employees and 92% of the employers believe it positively impacts the quality of work.

Title: Bitcoin whales move $230mln to exchanges, yet BTC holds range – Why?

Time Published: 2025-12-26T00:00:33Z

Big wallets moved Bitcoin to exchanges, but price hesitation left traders questioning the next move. Bitcoin’s muted price action, paired with renewed whale activity, unsettled market sentiment on the 25th of December. On that day, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale and asset manager BlackRock transferred large BTC amounts to exchanges, according to Onchain Lens. Onchain Lens reported that BlackRock deposited 2,292 Bitcoin [BTC], worth $199.8 million, into Coinbase. Separately, a whale wallet dormant for eight years deposited 400 BTC, valued at $34.92 million, into OKX. Large holders often shape short-term sentiment, as traders monitor such transfers for potential sell-side pressure. That dynamic left market participants cautious, even without immediate confirmation of spot selling. On top of that, U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds extended their losing streak. SoSoValue data showed Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded five consecutive days of net outflows. Source: SoSoValue That pattern suggested institutional demand remained fragile despite Bitcoin holding above key technical support. Together, ETF outflows and exchange deposits reinforced a defensive market tone. At press time, Bitcoin traded near $87,700, down roughly 0.35% on the day. During the same period, Open Interest fell 0.99% to $57.42 billion, reflecting reduced leverage exposure. That decline signaled traders unwound risk rather than positioning aggressively for a breakout. Even so, intraday positioning hinted at localized bullish conviction. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass’ Liquidation Map, major leverage clusters sat near $85,966 below price and $88,636 above. At these levels, intraday traders have built $646.17 million worth of long-leveraged positions and $422.42 million worth of short-leveraged positions. This suggests that traders were tilted toward the bullish side and strongly believe that BTC’s price will not fall below the $85,966 level. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the weekly chart revealed that BTC has been in a tight consolidation zone between the $86,000 and $93,500 levels since the 17th of November. Historically, consolidation breakouts or breakdowns lead to major rallies or declines, and as BTC’s price approaches the lower boundary, it has sparked fear of a potential breakdown below this range. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, if sentiment remains unchanged and BTC breaks below the key support at $86,000 with a daily candle close beneath it, it could open the door to a massive downside move. However, the bearish outlook would only be invalidated if BTC breaks out above the upper boundary at the $93,500 level.

Since the start of January, the overall U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin supply has increased by more than $100 billion, to $314 billion total. But that doesn’t mean all boats have risen at the same rate. To measure stablecoin performance, Decrypt calculated velocity using historical data from crypto price aggregator CoinGecko from January through December 15. Velocity divides total volume by average supply, resulting in a calculation of how many times each coin has, on average, changed hands. As former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chairman Timothy Massad explained to Decrypt, measuring velocity beats rankings that rely only on total supply. “Stablecoins can be very useful without there being a large market cap,” he said. “In other words, it's really the velocity, the transaction use, and they can circulate very quickly even if the amount outstanding is not that great.” Tether tops the list with a velocity of 166 because it’s long been a workhorse for global crypto trading. It can’t claim the crown as the first-ever stablecoin—that belongs to BitUSD. But it launched the same year, in 2014, and became the first widely used one. Tether boasts a market capitalization of $186 billion after increasing 35% since the start of the year, according to CoinGecko data. The bulk of Tether tokens get traded on Ethereum (46.3%) and Tron (41.4%), according to DeFi Llama data. Tether began the year by relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele declared BTC legal tender in 2021. There have been a few bumps, though. In March, Binance said it would delist USDT for European Union users to stay compliant with MiCA regulations, which require stablecoin issuers to be licensed. But that’s not stopped the company from turning a hefty profit. So far in 2025, Tether has seen $10 billion in profit in the first three quarters of the year, the company said in October. Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD, swiped the second spot with a velocity of 71. That means, on average, every RLUSD token has changed hands 71 times since the start of the year. In most stablecoin lineups, Circle’s USDC would hold this spot because its $78 billion market capitalization trumps that of RLUSD’s $1.3 billion. But as Massad pointed out, stablecoin performance has more to do with being able to move money efficiently than its total supply. Ripple was provisionally approved for a national banking charter by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, in December. “This is a massive step forward—first for RLUSD— setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight,” Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. HUGE news! @Ripple just received conditional approval from the @USOCC to charter Ripple National Trust Bank. This is a massive step forward - first for $RLUSD, setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight. To the… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 12, 2025 Ripple Senior Vice President of Stablecoins Jack McDonald has often pointed out that RLUSD was specifically designed for institutional use. At the start of December, Ripple got the green light from the Singapore Monetary Authority, or MAS, to expand XRP and RLUSD payments in Singapore. And earlier this year, RLUSD was integrated into Securitize's tokenization platform. That means it’s one of the assets investors can swap for tokenized money market funds. USDC saw its velocity reach 56 in 2025, while its market capitalization climbed 78% to $78.4 billion by December 15. Perhaps more than any of its competitors, Circle benefitted massively from the passage of the GENIUS Act. Its operating model already resembled the federally regulated framework that’s now become U.S. law. That’s given Circle a head start on compliance and investor confidence—and investors took note. CRCL was so popular with investors on its debut that the NYSE halted trading three times. Since then, Circle has reported $740 million in Q3 revenue, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle has also rolled out the testnet for Arc, its layer-1 blockchain, which counts BlackRock, Visa, and Amazon Web Services as early participants. Circle was also one of several stablecoin issuers—including Ripple, Paxos and BitGo—which got a provisional approval for its national banking charter and will be looking to expand into broader financial services. USD1 is an outlier because it launched in April, and therefore doesn’t have nearly a full year’s worth of data. But that didn’t stop it from landing right next to the podium with a velocity of 39. Issued by World Liberty Financial—the crypto-focused firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and partners—USD1 was designed from the outset to be a highly liquid transactional stablecoin. The token reached a $1 billion market cap in April, less than a month after its launch, according to data from CoinGecko. There have been some very bullish predictions about its growth. Blockstreet’s Kyle Klemmer told Decrypt he believes USD1 will be the world’s dominant stablecoin, beating USDT and USDC, before President Donald Trump’s second term ends in 2029. The project has leaned heavily on retail distribution and promotional partnerships, including integrations with several U.S.-based crypto exchanges, like Coinbase and FalconX, and it’s making a bid to become “Solana’s go-to stablecoin” by teaming up with meme coin platform Bonk and decentralized exchange Raydium. PayPal USD’s velocity of 18 lands it in fifth place on this list. Its 2023 debut made big waves because it was the first time an established payments platform made a bid at issuing a stablecoin—years before there was a regulatory framework in the U.S.. For most of this year, growth for PYUSD moved at a modest pace. Its market capitalization peaked above $1 billion in June and then established a foothold in September. Since then, it’s nearly tripled to $3.8 billion as of December 15. PayPal has teamed with LayerZero to expand the token’s presence to nine new blockchains, including Tron, Abstract, Aptos, and Avalanche. But there’s also been some controversy. In October, observers noted that PYUSD issuer Paxos minted and then immediately burned $300 trillion worth of tokens. It’s an impossibly large number of tokens, given it represents more than twice the world’s GDP. At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root… — Paxos (@Paxos) October 15, 2025 "This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach,” the firm wrote on X. “Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause." Ethena Labs’ USDe demonstrated a velocity of 11 in 2025, with its market capitalization showing a modest gain of 11% from $5.8 billion in January to $6.5 billion by December 15. But that trajectory leaves out the fact that its market cap soared to nearly $15 billion before the early October flash crash. USDe is the only stablecoin on this list that isn’t backed by fiat currency: It’s backed by a delta-neutral strategy involving staked Ethereum and perpetual futures hedges. But its reliance on derivatives means that times of high volatility and shifts in sentiment can cause big swings in market capitalization. Even with a less straightforward structure, the token’s advocates include billionaire Arthur Hayes. But not all regulators are convinced. Ethena Labs pulled out of the German market in April over growing scrutiny over its “serious deficiencies” in compliance. Sky’s USDS showed extremely low velocity of 1 in 2025—and that’s by design. To avoid confusion: Sky is a rebrand of DeFi OG MakerDAO and USDS is a rebrand of its DAI stablecoin. Unlike USDT or USDC, which function as transactional stablecoins, most USDS tokens sit locked in Maker vaults or savings contracts as collateral for DeFi loans rather than circulating. Its role in DeFi is closer to a yield-bearing savings instrument than digital cash, so it naturally turns over far less often. For example, the Sky Protocol currently offers a 4% rewards rate (paid in SKY tokens) to users who hold USDS. As of 2025, USDS has seen its market capitalization grow from $5.2 billion at the start of the year to $9.8 billion, marking an 85% increase in just under 12 months.

Title: Why Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashing Again?

Time Published: 2025-12-25T18:30:25Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are crashing again, with the crypto market failing to record a ‘Santa rally’ like other major assets. This comes as BTC and ETH continue to face significant selling pressure from the crypto ETFs, which are facing sustained outflows. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down again amid selling pressure from the BTC and ETH ETFs. According to Arkham data, BlackRock deposited 2,292 BTC ($200 million) and 9,976 ETH ($29 million) into Coinbase yesterday, likely to sell these coins. This marked the second time this week that the world’s largest asset manager had sent BTC and ETH to Coinbase in a bid to offload these coins. Further data from Arkham shows that BlackRock deposited 2,838.78 Bitcoin ($255 million) and 29,928 Ethereum ($91.29 million) into Coinbase on December 22. These sell-offs come as the crypto ETFs continue to record significant outflows. The BTC ETFs have seen a total net outflow of $330 million this week, while the ETH ETFs have a weekly net outflow of $11 million. This indicates that the institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum is fading at the moment, which provides a bearish outlook for the largest crypto assets by market cap. A CoinShares report released earlier this week revealed that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $460 million last week, while Ethereum ETPs saw outflows of $555 million. From a macro perspective, the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have also continued to decline as the Fed looks unlikely to cut interest rates at the January FOMC meeting. The recent U.S. GDP and jobless claims reports have sparked a surge in the odds that the Fed will hold rates steady next month. A CryptoQuant analysis revealed that the bear market risk is becoming more relevant based on the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI). The BCMI is said to be below equilibrium at the moment but well above historical bottom zones. This suggests that there is still more room for the BTC price to drop to the downside. The CryptoQuant analysis stated that from a data-driven perspective, this opens the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a bear phase and not just experiencing a pullback. If history repeats itself, BTC is expected to form a more durable bottom if the BCMI revisits the 2019 to 2023 levels. The analysis added that this is a scenario worth considering, as at this stage, the market appears to be in a downward transition rather than a completed reset.

Title: How to Stay Ahead of AI as an Early-Career Engineer
URL: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-effect-entry-level-jobs
Time Published: 2025-12-25T17:00:02Z
Full Content:
As AI takes on more work, expectations for entry-level roles grow “AI is not going to take your job. The person who uses AI is going to take your job.” This is an idea that has become a refrain for, among others, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has publicly made the prediction several times since October 2023. Meanwhile, other AI developers and stalwarts say the technology will eliminate countless entry-level jobs. These predictions have come at the same time as reports of layoffs at companies including IBM and Amazon, causing anxiety for tech workers—especially those starting their careers, whose responsibilities are often more easily automated. Early reports have borne out some of these anxieties in employment data. For example, entry-level hiring at the 15 biggest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024, according to a report from SignalFire last May. Still, it’s unclear what the long-term effects will be, or whether hiring cuts are actually a result of AI. For instance, while Meta laid off 600 employees from its AI division in October (and continued hiring other AI researchers), OpenAI began hiring junior software engineers. This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2026. In 2026, all new graduates may face a tougher job market in the United States. Employers’ rating of the job market for college graduates is now at its most pessimistic since 2020, according to data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook 2026 survey. However, 49 percent of respondents still consider the job market “good” or “very good.” So, what does the rise of generative AI mean for early-career engineers? “This is a tectonic shift,” says Hugo Malan, president of the science, engineering, technology and telecom reporting unit within the staffing agency Kelly Services. AI agents aren’t poised to replace workers one-to-one, though. Instead, there will be a realignment of which jobs are needed, and what those roles look like. When publicly available AI tools first arrived, Malan says the expectation was that jobs like call-center roles would be most vulnerable. “But what nobody predicted was that the biggest impact by far would be on programmers,” a trend he attributes to the relatively solitary and highly structured nature of the work. He notes that, while other economic conditions also factor into the job market, the pace of programmer employment decline has accelerated since generative AI came on the scene. In the United States, overall programmer employment fell a dramatic 27.5 percent between 2023 and 2025, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics. But employment for software developers—a distinct, more design-oriented position in the government data—only fell 0.3 percent in the same period. At the same time, some positions, such as information security analyst and AI engineer are actually growing, Malan says. “There’s been this pretty dramatic readjustment of the job landscape, even with as narrow a field as IT. Within IT, some jobs have exploded, like InfoSec analysts have grown in double digits, whereas programmers declined double digits” over the past few years, he says. (Eventually, Malan says he expects generative AI to affect all intellectual work.) Job responsibilities also appear to be changing. For recent graduates pursuing roles labeled as software-engineering jobs, “they’re not necessarily just coding,” says Jamie Grant, senior associate director for the engineering team at the University of Pennsylvania’s career services. “There tends to be so much higher-order thinking and knowledge of the software-development life cycle,” as well as a need to work with other parties, such as understanding user and client demands, she says. In her work advising Penn students, Grant hears concerns about AI’s effects on the job market from many engineering students and their parents. But during conversations with them, she says she tries to maintain an ethos of “we can make this work for us, not against us.” According to a report from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, jobs involving tasks that could be automated with AI appear to be more susceptible to early-career employment dips than those where AI augments an employee’s ability to perform their job. The NACE data supports this: Sixty-one percent of employers say they are not replacing entry-level jobs with AI, while 41 percent are discussing or planning to augment these jobs with AI within the next five years. Over the past few years, computer-programmer employment in the United States has dropped sharply—but overall employment in the computing industry hasn’t seen the same decline. “Think about an exoskeleton that you could wear that allows you to lift 1,000 pounds,” Grant says. “AI should be, just as the people at Stanford say, an augmentation to your work, to your higher-order critical-thinking skills.” That being said, she advises students to be cautious of the risks, such as sharing sensitive or proprietary information with a chatbot. At this point, Grant thinks proficiency with AI tools is an unwritten expectation of many employers. But students and early-career workers should also recognize where AI can’t help. “AI can’t necessarily be with you in that moment of negotiation or of client-relationship development,” she says. “You still need to be able to perform at your highest level of capabilities.” And foundational skills like problem solving and communication are consistently prioritized by employers. With AI tools performing more of the “grunt work” that has served as a training ground for early-career workers, expectations for recent graduates are high. In the past, junior engineers have cultivated proficiency while doing simpler, more task-oriented work. “But if all of those are going to get taken over, you need to slot in at a higher level almost from day one,” Malan says. This leaves recent graduates in a difficult spot. To help students prepare, the education system will likely need to change, for instance by encouraging students to become proficient using AI and take on more hands-on, experiential learning. Today’s employers are looking for demonstrated skills, says Grant. “If you’re just going to class and doing projects and maybe getting a great GPA, that’s amazing. But you also need to be applying what you’re learning,” she says. Industry experience and demonstrated proficiencies are among the top factors considered by employers surveyed in NACE’s Job Outlook 2026. One solution may even lie in entirely different educational models, like apprenticeship. “Often, students in a more traditional computer-software degree program get a lot of theoretical knowledge,” but they may not have much experience building software on a team, says Mike Roberts, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Creating Coding Careers. Recent graduates may not be ready to ship code on day one—but AI can. Apprenticeship allows students to learn on the job in a structured program, and helps “to much more effectively close the experience gap,” Roberts says. Training the next generation of humans might also better serve the long-term interests of employers, he says. In today’s software engineering, many companies tend to be short-sighted in their hiring, thinking more of the next quarter than four or five years down the line. But “if you don’t train new early entrants into the market, you will eventually have no more people becoming mid-levels,” says Roberts. “It’s very myopic.” Also, AI can help ramp up new employees faster than ever. “I find it an exciting time, because it’s never been faster to build high-quality software,” Roberts says. “But it’s weird that folks are not seeing the virtue of continuing to invest in humans.” Gwendolyn Rak is an assistant editor at IEEE Spectrum covering consumer electronics and careers.

Title: Top 10 SaaStr AI Predictions for 2026
URL: https://www.saastr.com/top-10-saastr-ai-predictions-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T16:10:30Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai So we decided to do something fun this year and write up our 2026 predictions together with every single SaaStr speaker and AI post of the year! How? Every single SaaStr AI session, interview and speaker was ingested into Claude so we worked the Top 10 for 2026 up … together. Our Top 10 Predictions for B2B + AI for 2026: The Prediction: AI-native B2B companies will run sales teams that are 50% smaller than their predecessors while maintaining or increasing revenue. The Evidence: At SaaStr, we’re already seeing this play out. We deployed an AI BDR that created 25% of our new pipeline in just 90 days. One leading AI dev tools company just closed a $4M+ annual deal where the Sales Engineer ran the entire relationship—the sales team’s only contribution was helping price the deal. What the data shows: The shift: The traditional “WFH mid-pack inside sales rep” faces extinction. The survivors will be: Sources: ICONIQ Growth GTM Benchmarking Study 2025; SaaStr AI Agent Deployment Data; Replit Head of Sales Engineering (conversation); SaaStr internal pipeline data The Prediction: The highest-performing B2B companies will have AI agents handling 40-60% of initial prospect and customer interactions by the end of the year. or at least on that path. The Evidence: At SaaStr, we now have more AIs than humans. We deployed 20+ agents across outbound sales, inbound, support, and operations—generating over $1M in direct revenue and handling 15,000+ messages in 100 days with 5-7% response rates (vs. 2-4% industry average). What’s working: The reality check: This isn’t “set and forget.” Managing agents now consumes 30% of our Chief AI Officer’s time. But the companies that figure this out in 2025 will have a massive operational advantage by 2026. As Wade Foster (CEO, Zapier) puts it: “The agent is basically doing 90 plus percent of the work and leaves the last mile to the account rep to make it happen.” That’s the hybrid model that works—AI for volume, humans for the critical last mile. Sources: SaaStr AI Agent Playbook (saastr.com); Amélie Lerutte, Chief AI Officer at SaaStr; Wade Foster, CEO Zapier; Qualified AI deployment data; Artisan campaign metrics The Prediction: By end of 2026, the majority of internal business applications and MVPs will be built through natural language prompts rather than traditional development. Not necessarily for production-grade apps, but everything up to that point. The Evidence: The numbers are unprecedented: I’ve personally built 9+ production apps on Replit with 750,000+ total uses, including financial modeling tools, content systems, and startup simulation games—all without writing traditional code. The breakthrough: After 100+ days of “vibe coding,” I achieved what I call “Replit Fluency”—the ability to see any app I want to build in my head and know exactly how to prompt it to production. This state is reachable by anyone willing to invest the learning curve. The market size: Based on current trajectories, the vibe coding TAM could reach $150-400B by 2030. Sources: Lovable founder Anton Osika (revenue announcement); Cursor revenue data (multiple sources); Replit Agent experience; Jason Lemkin direct experience with 9 production apps on Replit From Zero to Replit Fluent: How 9 Apps and 500,000 Users Taught Me to How to ‘Vibe’ Apps Into Production The Prediction: “Pretty good” SaaS companies ($20-100M ARR, 25-40% growth) will find themselves in no-man’s land with no clear path to exit. The Evidence: The math is brutal: From 2012-2023, nearly every SaaStr Fund portfolio company crossing $20M ARR with solid fundamentals received multiple PE offers. That’s not happening anymore. The middle-tier SaaS companies are stuck. What to do: Get profitable, optimize for cash flow over ARR growth, extend runway to 2026-2027, and focus on fundamentals (NRR >100%, gross margins >75%, Rule of 40+). Sources: ICONIQ venture data; SaaStr Fund I portfolio experience; Meritech Capital SaaStr Annual presentation; PE deal data (Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity, Clearlake) The Prediction: Leading AI companies will achieve 65-75% gross margins, fundamentally changing the “AI is expensive” narrative. The Evidence: OpenAI’s compute margin hit 70% in October 2025—up from 35% in January 2024. They doubled margin efficiency in less than two years. What’s driving it: The catch for startups: Competition raises the bar as fast as costs fall. One SaaStr Fund portfolio company at $100M ARR is adding $6M in inference costs next year—not because their product is broken, but to leapfrog competition. The treadmill never stops. Have AI Gross Margins Really Turned the Corner? The Real Math Behind OpenAI’s 70% Compute Margin — And Why B2B Startups Are Still Running on a Treadmill Sources: OpenAI compute margin data (The Information); Token cost analysis; SaaStr Fund portfolio company data; Mary Meeker AI Report The Prediction: Companies will transform support from a $2M cost center to a $500K profit center using AI agents. The Evidence: Gorgias deployed AI customer service to 500+ brands achieving: Their AI agents now handle 2.4 million automated interactions monthly, charging $1 per interaction while spending ~$0.22-0.23 on LLM costs. The bigger opportunity: The Shopping Assistant is driving 3-8% sales lift for merchants. Stores are choosing to keep AI live full-time instead of staffing human chat. Support is becoming a revenue driver. What’s required: Sources: Gorgias AI deployment data; Gorgias “30 in 30” program; Qualified AI support metrics; Intercom Fin deployment results (Paul Adams, CPO) The Prediction: Most AI companies will shift from pure seat-based pricing to token markup or hybrid models with seats + inference. The Evidence: Cursor’s pricing backlash exposed a fundamental problem: 5% of power users can consume 80% of compute costs, making per-seat pricing unsustainable. The new models emerging: Why this is inevitable: The industry shift: When your entire business model depends on marking up someone else’s tokens, you’re vulnerable to upstream pricing decisions. The sustainable companies will build genuine software value on top. Sources: Cursor pricing analysis; Jared Palmer (Vercel) on model costs; Oscar Le (token markup thesis); SaaS pricing research The Prediction: Multiple $50B+ IPOs from AI and AI-native companies, dwarfing 2021. The candidates: What’s different from 2021: The math: Databricks at $5B ARR growing 55% could command $80-100B. Anthropic could be the largest tech IPO ever. If it doesn’t go out in 2026, Stripe might be #1. Sources: Databricks financial data; Stripe revenue reports; Ramp growth data; Rippling product expansion; IPO market analysis The Prediction: The efficiency gap between AI-native and traditional companies will become insurmountable. The Evidence: At SaaStr: We now run an eight-figure business with single-digit headcount and 20+ AI agents. We went from 20+ human employees to 3 humans plus 20+ agents while maintaining revenue scale. What this means for hiring: The competitive implication: When your competitor operates with 30% fewer GTM headcount and 40% better unit economics, that’s not a sustainable disadvantage. Sources: Cursor employee data; Bessemer State of AI 2025 (AI Supernovas vs. Shooting Stars); SaaStr operational data; Lovable team size The Prediction: Either OpenAI or Anthropic will reach $1 trillion valuation by end of 2026. The Evidence: As Rory O’Driscoll noted in the 20VC year-end review: Anthropic’s “growth rate is faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… Dario’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” What gets them there: The wild card: At least one major AI company may have a significant down round. Private market valuations are unsustainable for many players. Sources: OpenAI revenue data (The Information); Anthropic valuation reports; Mary Meeker/Bond Capital AI Trends Report; ChatGPT usage metrics Every one of these predictions points to the same conclusion: This technology cycle is moving faster than anything in human history. The companies that adapt quickest will capture disproportionate value. Those that wait for “certainty” will find themselves competing against AI-native challengers with 10x productivity advantages. You know this. The question isn’t whether AI will transform your business—it’s whether you’ll lead that transformation or be disrupted by it. 2025 was your very last chance to mostly … watch. And maybe just launch a co-pilot.

Title: Crypto sentiment is trapped in extreme fear because the industry’s biggest structural wins are failing to move prices
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-2025-sentiment-collapse-performance-gap/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T15:30:52Z

Investors won the policy battles, the regulatory clarity, and the institutional access they wanted. Bitcoin still dropped 30% and looks to finish the year negative. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto sentiment gauges have spent the past two months deep in the red. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has spent more than 30% of 2025 in fear or extreme fear territory, and alternative trackers put the market in a 10-25 range out of 100 since mid-November. Bitcoin is on track for its worst fourth quarter since 2018, many large altcoins are down up to 90% from their highs, and gold, silver, and major stock indices pushed to new highs in the same period. The mood is poisonous. Investors got all of the macro, the policy, the structural wins they'd been lobbying for since 2021, and the reward was a market that faded every rally and underperformed every competing asset class. That's not how cycles are supposed to end. It's how trust collapses, and narratives break. Understanding why sentiment cratered requires unpacking five overlapping drivers: performance versus expectations, thinning liquidity, brutal leverage washouts, confusing macro conditions, and narrative fatigue that turned bullish milestones into sell-the-news traps. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,000 in October, with a setup that looked clean: spot ETFs drew record inflows, the US government shutdown sparked a safe-haven narrative, and a third rate cut was set. Yet, instead of the parabolic fourth quarter many anticipated, Bitcoin dropped 30% and is finishing the year down single digits, marking its worst fourth quarter since 2018. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. Altcoins fared worse, down up to 90% from their highs, wiped out by thin liquidity and the realization that most tokens launched between 2024 and 2025 had no product-market fit beyond speculation. The divergence with traditional assets only compounded the pain. Gold gained 70%, silver rallied 143%, and the S&P 500 pushed to new highs. Crypto investors watched their portfolios bleed while every other “debasement hedge” printed gains. That divergence creates a specific kind of sentiment poison: the feeling that you got the thesis right but chose the wrong instrument, or worse, that the asset class is broken. When performance lags expectations by that margin, and the setup looks perfect, sentiment doesn't soften; it collapses. On-chain data shows Bitcoin transaction volumes and active addresses trending down since November, with daily volume down sharply and activity falling by double digits. VanEck's mid-December chain report flagged weak fees, stagnant new addresses, and soft hash-rate growth. Derivatives and futures volumes have been sliding since late August, and multiple trading desks describe “weak buying pressure” around the $87,000-$90,000 band. When prices chop lower on declining volume, it signals that buyers have stepped away. Bitcoin tested support repeatedly, failed to reclaim higher levels, and each failed bounce reinforced the perception that the market had no conviction. With 2025 marking drastic valuation drop-offs, token launch strategies face scrutiny for prioritizing unicorn dreams over practical fundamentals. Thinning liquidity also amplifies downside volatility. Without deep bids, small sell orders gap the market lower, triggering stop-losses and liquidations that feed the fear gauges. The decline in active addresses suggests retail is exiting. Institutions provide capital but not the speculative energy that drives crypto's upside volatility. When retail leaves, the market becomes a battle between levered traders and long-term holders, with neither willing to chase prices higher. That produces the grinding, low-volume selloff that defined the fourth quarter. The November crash combined profit-taking above $100,000, ETF outflows, and an estimated $20 billion leverage flush in October. Long-dormant “OG” wallets moved and sold hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin into strength, which many read as “smart money top-ticking the cycle.” The leverage flush was mechanical: Bitcoin rallied above $120,000, open interest hit records, funding rates spiked, and the market overheated. When Bitcoin failed to break higher and started selling off, liquidations cascaded. Longs turned into forced sellers, stop-losses triggered, and the structure unwound in days. That kind of forced selling doesn't just move prices; it breaks sentiment. The long-term holder distribution added psychological damage. When wallets that haven't moved in years suddenly activate and sell, the market interprets it as insiders exiting. That perception may not be accurate, but it matters more than reality when forming sentiment. If the market believes “smart money” sold the top, everyone else assumes they're holding the bag. That belief becomes self-fulfilling: remaining holders sell to avoid being last out, which drives prices lower, reinforcing fear and driving more selling. Recent US inflation prints and Fed communications increased the odds of 2026 rate cuts, but not enough to give a clear “lower for longer” signal. Crypto mirrored every wobble in risk assets rather than trading like a haven, reinforcing the perception that Bitcoin is a high-beta tech exposure rather than a store of value. When the dollar weakened, Bitcoin rallied briefly. When risk appetite faded, Bitcoin sold off harder than equities. That pattern destroyed the “digital gold” narrative, at least for now. Additionally, regulatory progress has been messy. Europe is implementing MiCA, forcing exchanges and stablecoin issuers to comply or exit. The US GENIUS Act is turning into concrete stablecoin rules, but it won't be finalized until 2027. The CLARITY Act stalled after a long government shutdown. A January markup is the start of the sausage-making process, not the finish line Sacks claims. The industry also faces a wave of private lawsuits as SEC enforcement recedes, keeping legal risk at the forefront. None of that screams “clean runway.” The confusion matters because crypto's 2025 thesis rested on clarity: spot ETFs would bring institutional capital, a crypto-friendly administration would remove regulatory overhang, and macro conditions would favor hard assets. All three happened, but the payoff didn't materialize. That gap between thesis and outcome drives sentiment from optimism to confusion to fear. 2025 delivered a “crypto president,” spot ETFs, big-name IPOs like Circle's, and tokenization headlines from BlackRock, but prices dropped after every event. Trump's election was supposed to be bullish, but Bitcoin sold off. Spot ETF inflows hit records, but Bitcoin chopped sideways then dropped. Circle's IPO was supposed to validate the sector, but it came and went with no sustained price reaction. Each milestone became a sell-the-news trap. Altcoins underperformed badly while gold and silver stole the “hard asset” spotlight. When a sector gets most of the structural wins it's been lobbying for and still underperforms, retail's default mood shifts from euphoria to disappointment. The crypto market just nuked, with the largest ever liquidation event in 24 hours and a bloodbath for altcoins triggering traders' PTSD. The industry won policy battles, regulatory clarity, institutional access, and political support, but none of it translated into sustained price appreciation. Instead, the wins became exhaustion points: smart money sold the announcements, retail bought the hype, and prices ended up lower. Narrative fatigue means investors stop believing in the next catalyst. When every bullish event has been a selling opportunity, why would the next one be different? The market becomes a trap: good news doesn't move prices, bad news accelerates selling. That's the environment that produces extreme fear and keeps it pinned for months. The extreme fear readings capture a market that feels betrayed by its own thesis. Investors believed in the halving cycle, the ETF narrative, the regulatory clarity story, and the macro setup. All of those things happened, and the market still sold off. That's not just disappointing for traders chasing profits, it's disorienting for everyone with stakes in the market. Extreme fear can be a contrarian signal. Historically, some of the best entry points come when sentiment is at its worst. ETF flows hit $941 million in two months, but real adoption hinges on Ripple's ODL volumes, on-chain payments, and RLUSD growth on XRPL. However, that only works if underlying conditions improve. Right now, the conditions that drove fear, such as thinning liquidity, leverage overhang, macro confusion, and narrative fatigue, haven't resolved. They've settled into a new equilibrium where prices chop lower, volume declines, and nobody wants to call a bottom. Until one or more of those conditions break, sentiment will stay depressed. The question for 2026 is whether the market can find a catalyst strong enough to reverse that trend, or whether this cycle ends not with a bang but with a slow, grinding capitulation that leaves the entire narrative in ruins.

Title: The Resilience of the Church of Climate

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Tilak’s Substack In the aftermath of the UN’s COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, several commentators have claimed that the age of climate alarmism may finally be fraying at the edges. The Wall Street Journal concluded that Europe’s green energy policies slashed emissions but at the cost of crippling the economy. PJ Media’s Rick Moran argues that “the religion of climate alarmism is in decline”. He finds that President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the high-profile defection from the climate alarmist priesthood by Bill Gates has begun to alter the debate over climate change. Peter Savodnik of the Free Press wrote last week that those who questioned the calamity of climate change were treated like pariahs for years but now, “their day of vindication has come”. He cites Bjorn Lomborg, who opined that “I believe we are witnessing a broader, more balanced reassessment of climate change”. The evidence against climate alarmism is no longer relegated to alternative media. It is visible in electricity bills that have exploded precisely in those countries and states – Germany, Great Britain, California – most exposed to wind and solar absolutism. It became apparent in the great Iberian Peninsula blackout in April, which lasted for hours and led to the deaths of 11 people, a systemwide failure due to insufficient fossil fuels-based synchronous generation and an excessive reliance on inverter-based solar power. It is evident in Europe’s industrial heartlands, hollowed out by irrational energy policies sold as moral imperatives but delivered as economic self-sabotage. Yet another reminder of Western Europe’s on-going deindustrialisation emerged two days ago, as the Financial Times reported that Volkswagen will stop manufacturing vehicles at its site in Dresden, marking the first time in the carmaker’s 88-year history that it will close production at a site in Germany. Even in the EU, the epicentre of green utopianism, policymakers have come under pressure from powerful business lobbies to weaken proposed ‘sustainability’ rules as part of a drive to reduce burdens on domestic enterprises. AP reported yesterday that European officials moved to ease their ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and automakers who argued that the industry needed more flexibility to help achieve EU climate goals. Climate as Theology Yet, belief in imminent climate catastrophe remains remarkably resilient among Western elites. Optimism in rationality prevailing may be premature. The Church of Climate, with its high priests and devoted flock, has proven remarkably resilient over decades, weathering empirical assaults and expert rebuttals with the tenacity of a faith unmoored from facts. The question worth asking is no longer whether the alarmists are right — they are not — but why the creed survives so unscathed by evidence, falsification and repeated policy failure. This durability is not rational. It is moral, ideological and ultimately theological. For many years now, serious scientists and scholars with unimpeachable credentials — William Happer, John Clauser, Judith Curry and many others — have demolished the claim that the climate system is threatened with an imminent apocalypse caused by fossil fuel-based emissions. Steve Koonin’s careful exposition of the data made this plain to any reader willing to separate evidence from rhetoric. And yet these arguments yield no value to the priesthood of climate alarm. The reason is simple: the dispute is not about data. It is about virtue and the seductive promise of meaningfulness. Climate alarmism long ago ceased to be a scientific hypothesis and became instead a moral identity. Its adherents see themselves as uniquely compassionate, enlightened and willing to ‘care for the planet’ in contrast to the supposedly venal, backward or morally defective climate change deniers. These ‘deniers’, as the inquisitors label them, are not fringe figures but guardians of scientific integrity against a modern Lysenkoism where dissent is heresy. Climate alarmism serves another powerful purpose. It is the modern expression of what Friedrich Hayek called the “fatal conceit“: the belief that a self-appointed elite, armed with models and moral certainty, can out-think the dispersed intelligence of markets, societies and freely choosing individuals. This conceit is reinforced by what might be called the ‘noble lie‘. Many within the climate establishment openly or tacitly believe that exaggeration is justified — indeed necessary — if it nudges the masses toward ‘correct’ behaviour. If climate change must be overstated, so be it. If uncertainty must be suppressed, that too is a price worth paying. The end — planetary salvation — justifies the means. Layered into the climate alarmist narrative is yet another dimension of political calculus that aids social-democrat governments in power throughout the West with the significant exception of Trump’s America. The ever-imminent climate catastrophe handily provides politicians with the perfect hobgoblin that elicits among their constituents’ clamorous calls for being led to safety, as H. L. Mencken reminded us in his maxim on practical politics. Given these potent advantages of having a theology of climate, empirical refutation becomes irrelevant. Data that contradicts the narrative are not debated but delegitimised. Critics are not engaged; they are denounced. Expertise is not weighed; it is moralised. Hence the curious phenomenon of genuine Nobel-calibre physicists being dismissed as ‘deniers’, while political activists and failed politicians – the Bill McKibbens, Al Gores and Michael Manns of the world – are elevated to the status of scientific authorities and prophetic sages. The Package Deal But climate alarmism does not travel alone. It is part of a broader ideological package deal — an interlocking set of beliefs that reinforce one another psychologically and politically. The same individual who believes that capitalism is a form of exploitation will tend also to believe that Western industrial society is uniquely destructive. That same person is also likely to believe that markets cannot be trusted to allocate resources and that ‘crises’ — climate, Covid, inequality — require emergency powers of an overweening state. Unsurprisingly, this worldview also aligns neatly with support for Net Zero, ESG, DEI, gender ideology, industrial policy, public health lockdowns and the ever-expanding administrative state. This ideological coherence is not accidental. It reflects the long influence of identity-based cultural Marxism, which taught generations of Western intellectuals to interpret social and economic phenomena primarily through the lens of power, domination and historical white guilt. In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin. Climate change thus becomes the ultimate indictment of modernity itself: proof that prosperity, growth and technological progress were mistakes. Gad Saad’s notion of suicidal empathy yields insights into the intellectual power of the climatistas among Western intelligentsia. Suicidal empathy refers to a pattern where an individual’s deep compassion for others becomes so extreme that it leads to self-harm, burnout or the undermining of the people they are trying to help. In Saad’s words, it refers to “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic, hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets”. The empathy for ‘people and planet’ that forms the backbone of the climate narrative had led Western policymakers to prioritise abstract moral posturing over concrete human outcomes. It is this mindset that allows Western elites to congratulate themselves on decarbonisation targets while energy poverty rises, industries flee and living standards stagnate. The victims of these policies — the coal miners, factory workers and rural households — are dismissed as collateral damage or, worse, as morally suspect ‘deplorables’. The logic of climate alarmism encompasses the familiar phenomenon of Bootleggers and Baptists: the high priests of climate virtue including the juggernaut of lavishly funded environmental NGOs provide the moral cover, while a well-connected cohort of crony capitalists harvest subsidies, mandates and guaranteed returns. Wind and solar developers, ESG financiers and asset-management behemoths such as BlackRock have every incentive to keep the crisis narrative alive. The rhetoric of sacrifice is always for others; the rents are very much for themselves. Climate policy, with its fixation on targets detached from engineering and economics, fits this pattern all too well. This is why Trump’s challenge to climate orthodoxy was so destabilising. It was not merely a policy shift; it was a moral counter-revolution. By insisting on energy abundance, national interest and economic realism, Trump and his A-team in the energy and environmental patch – Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum – have punctured the sanctimony of the climate elite. Executive orders can be reversed, but ideas are harder to kill — and that is precisely why the backlash has been so ferocious. No Time for Complacency Yet complacency would be a grave mistake. The perceived moral high ground remains firmly occupied by the Church of Climate, and it confers enormous political power. Should Trump’s movement falter — if the midterms deliver a repudiation rather than reinforcement, and if the next Presidential elections are lost by the MAGA movement — the entire edifice of Net Zero dogma could snap back with renewed vengeance. Democrats, buoyed by mainstream media amplification and deep-state entrenchment, would reinstate green mandates, reversing Trump’s gains. The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings. The lesson of the past decade is sobering. Empirical truth, by itself, is not enough. Ideas matter, but so do moral narratives, institutional incentives and cultural coherence. Climate alarmism has proven resilient precisely because it is not a theory but a worldview — one that flatters its adherents, rewards its enforcers and immunises itself against doubt. If there is to be a genuine reckoning, it will require more than cheaper gas or failed wind farms. It will require reclaiming the moral language of human flourishing, exposing the hubris of central planning, and reasserting the primacy of evidence over piety. Until then, the climate apocalypse will remain postponed — but endlessly proclaimed.

Type your email… Subscribe wow the most comprehensive summary I have seen – but take heart – Trump is also bankrupting the climate NGOs as well so their noise will subside but as a former head of the UNIPCC stated- the real goal of the climate movement is the destruction of capitalism- so it will never go away as long as there are communist in charge of governments bankrupting the climate NGOs What was built once can always be rebuilt. True, except that the Church of Climate is losing adherents. And for the most part, they aren’t coming back. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. “There’s an old saying in Tennessee—I know it’s in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once, shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can’t get fooled again.” I really liked GWB, it’s a shame his personality didn’t translate well to the job. Are they really? The true adherents are loyal and will remain loyal, since loyalty was the only thing they ever had — loyalty to the propagandists. The adherents weren’t smart enough to do their homework, research the facts, listen to the debates. They still don’t know jack about climatology, or the Ice Ages, or electricity, or anything technical. They only know being part of the herd. They will never abandon their caste. And their leaders will ride them over the cliff. It’s a Jim Jones cult. Sort of like “from the river to the sea” without being able to identify either. overall great article, but the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd. The dude wants to absorb Greenland for no other reason that it’s easy and has never tried to take the moral view on anything. he could on some topics, but it seems he regards himself as a dirty exploitative manipulator. So, the dire predictions about the green comeback in the US will probably become reality. I hope the solution will come from a change in EU. He wanted to buy Greenland, not adsorb it, whatever that it in your mind. The US considered many times during many different administrations, beginning in 1867, to make this purchase. President Trump wanted to do this to improve the defense of the US from Russia and for other reasons. Don’t look at a map to see the defense issue, look at a globe. It may then be clear to you, or perhaps not. TDS? And how. But this is what we face: a large percentage of the populace that knows nothing about anything. They don’t think for themselves. They are easily swayed by propagandists. They are sheeple with a variety of insecurities, many induced by fear p*rn merchants. We can only hope that with patience and tough love that someday some of them will catch a clue. Brainwashed sheeple. Greenland, Iceland, and the Seward Peninsula are the increasingly important strategic zones of commerce/military choke-points. Russia is opening military ports on it’s northern coastal areas. the Greenland Sea is the main channel of Northwest Passage shipping traffic. China has already tried to buy military access to Greenland. With only 60k residents, and some of the poorest people on Earth, this is easily bought. Perhaps you want to place the country which jails people for Wrong-Think in charge of global commerce, or perhaps rethink that option. Adding Greenland would be the coolest maneuver in my lifetime. I want to take back all the trillions spent defending Europe, invading the Middle East and molding Hillary’s hairdo’s and use it to buy Greenland instead. You are one sick puppy! The US is vulnerable to attacks over the North Pole. Best you put away your illogical, mentallly-corrupt TDS and look at reality. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd.” Your complete disconnect from reality is the only thing that is absurd here. Trump is systematically dismantling globalist subjugation of nation states. He was elected in a landslide to eliminate government mandated woke indoctrination and bring common sense and merit back as the governing principles for human development. It might be the most significant counter revolution in American history policy wise. Well Trump is a counter-revolution to the crazies and their jester puppet who they flicked for the word salad woman when the gaslighting so obviously couldn’t continue. A return to normalcy when the crazies had lost the plot completely even working out how many human genders there are (Hint: it’s the same number if you want to try and change genders Dr Mengele) The only morality involved was exposing the lie you couldn’t stop villains pouring across the southern border plus MSM lying complicity and ferretting out the worst of the slushfunding and snouts in the taxpayer trough. With hindsight what was so hard about that except the crazies squealing like stuck pigs their slops weren’t so forthcoming anymore. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd” There is a certain validity to that comment. I do not believe Trump is motivated to a moral counter-revolution. Trump is a business man, not a politician, and reasonably adept at making deals. Most people do not bother to consider that his words and actions are tactical. What the future brings, is unknown, in planetary energy systems, national/world politics, none of it. Beer and popcorn time. I agree. People are putting far too much faith in the Trumpster. He only has a few more years left in office and the opposition are going to wait him out. Then it’s business as usual. Personally, i don’t think the Trumpster can change the course of america in 3 years. I could be wrong. Let’s hope so. From the article: “The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings.” That’s right. In the U.S., Republicans need to keep the majority in the U.S. House, otherwise, the Democrats will be in a position to hold up a lot of progress on Trump’s agenda. I think soon it will be obvious to even the most dense that the U.S. economy is booming and prices are coming down and will continue to come down. Gasoline prices are down to $2 a gallon in many places. Reducing the cost of gasoline by $0.80 per gallon adds about one percent to U.S. GDP growth. It also puts more money in consumers pockets as they spend less for gasoline, they can use that money to spend in another area of the economy, thus stimulating that area. Things are looking real good in the U.S, as the economy is growing at a 4.3 percent annual rate. It took Trump less than a year to turn things around and get the U.S. back on the right track. None of this would be happening if a Democrat had been elected president. The U.S. would probably be in an economic recession right now, had that happened. But, the Good Lord smiled on us. 🙂 Unfortunately, the Marxist do-gooders are always doing everything they can to shield their herded masses from any improvements in prosperity since they require “victims” to justify their actions (thus the insistence on programs and policies that hurt the poorest the most), and instead of being the vigilant exposers of corruption, the news media are divided into camps of apologists for their chosen champions. Add to that the fickle, changing with the wind “moderate center”. It is they who will decide where the power resides in the next year. Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy in that regard, since one ill-considered stumble at a critical moment can turn that inconstant element against him. Such is the nature of the identity politics morass in which we are mired. Echo chamber disconnects from reality define the left. If Republicans don’t maintain control of congress we are screwed. They have zero understanding about how things work in the real world. Virtue signalling and hate are all they have. The Republicans are not helping the cause. Too many are reverting into RINOs, probably because the inducements from lobbyists are too sweet to pass up. Our political class is a mess. We need new leaders with integrity and common sense. I think Republicans will probably hold the majority in the U.S. Senate after 2026. If the U.S. House goes Democrat, it will cause a lot of problems for Trump, but it won’t stop the economy from booming, and it won’t stop Trump’s agenda, although it may slow it down. I think the U.S. economy is going to be booming during this next year and things will look a lot better between now and then, as far as prices and other Democrat talking points are concerned. The Republican Congress should codify as much of Trump’s MAGA agenda into law as possible before the 2026 elections roll around. Just in case. 🙂 The U.S. Senate can pass Trump’s MAGA agenda under the reconciliation rules, where they don’t need 60 votes to pass the bill, just a majority. It is my understanding that they can do reconciliation votes two more times before the 2026 elections. I hope the US continues in the right direction and succeeds in recovering in energy. Most western nations are adamantly headed for the cliff. The leaders of the Western Democracies can’t tell the difference between speculation and established facts. If they could tell the difference, they would see that all this demonization of CO2 is just speculation and would not be bankrupting their nations over a Climate Crisis that has not been scientifically established as fact. “heading for the cliff” A verifiable tipping point. I agree indicators are good. News does not want to report that things are getting better so have to focus on 20-year old scandals. Can they hide it another 3 years? Just hoping no big places decide it’s a good time to invade any little places and that no bankers collapse. “Can they hide it another 3 years?” No doubt they will try. 🙂 And yes, there are still a lot of challenges ahead, but at least we have someone with common sense leading the U.S now. We need a problem solver and Trump is a problem solver. He’s trying to fix the accumulated problems of the last 50 years. And they need fixing. The media points to grasshoppers to keep reads clicking. The next biggie is what? Wait for it…. The problem is that the blue states are not seeing much improvement in economics and living conditions due to state Democrat policies. It is up to the GOP to hammer home that the red states are doing well but the Democrat miasmas are still stagnant due to Democrat policy. I agree. Some of that kind of reporting is starting. I saw several reports on Fox News comparing costs in Red States verses costs in Blue States. The Red State costs were lower. The Trump administration needs to make a big, public relations effort to refute the Democrat propaganda. And I think they intend to do so. Trump has already given two public speeches in an effort to refute the talking points of the Democrats. I saw a great chart of inflation since the first Trump administration. The inflation rate for Trump 2016 was colored red and was around 3 percent, then the portion of the chart representing Biden’s term was colored blue and showed inflation shooting up like a rocket, and then Trump’s second term shows red again, and the inflation rate is back down to around three percent (2.7 percent as of the last reading). Looking at the chart, it is obvious that the price of things skyrocketed during the Biden years. And of course, the lying Democrats want to blame Trump for the high prices. It is SO disingenuous, but that’s the Democrats for you. They have no problem lying when the truth is obviously different. They depend on the Leftwing Propaganda Media to prop their lies up. EU did not “slash” any emissions, stop repeating their lies. But they did wreck their economies in the attempt! Are destroying, not did. The Wall Street Journal reported…. That shows how reliable that media, erm, propaganda organization is. Well written article, inciteful, and so true! 2026 should be very interesting as rival factions clash. Popcorn please! I wouldn’t call what is about to happen “interesting; I’d call it frightening. If the left continues with their obstructionist behavior, we will approach the possibility of civil war. Those who don’t want to see our country moved to the extreme left and threatened by increasing lawless acts of terrorism are rapidly growing weary, even exhausted, by those threats. It seems to be escalating and simply can’t go on, as is, much longer. We are already engaged in a civil war. We are a nation divided. If you do not agree with the position and recite the rhetoric verbatim you are a denier, the enemy. No middle ground. No dispassionate, mature debate allowed. Those wishing an open debate are silenced. Every issue has valid points on both sides, but only one side is allowed a voice. Popcorn, but do not forget the beer. We need MORE CO2. Very good article. Just have to comment on the photo – seems ER is in serious decline when they have to resort to dressing up dudes in Handmaiden costumes. Perhaps fitting that their protests now feature clowns. Can anyone still take them seriously? It should be rather embarrassing for a man to be dressed in that manner. “dudes in Handmaiden costumes” I took note of that myself. I said to myself: That’s not a gal there, he has a beard. I wondered why he was there dressed like that. I suppose he could be trans, Odd. Such a different world we live in now. I pity the children trying to make sense out of all this. It’s a lot tougher now. But it can be done. You can’t take people like this seriously. I can’t imagine the thought processes going on in those heads. Dazed and Confused, comes to mind. Sadly the children are not allowed to try to make sense of this. Rather, they are being told what to believe and not taught how to think. That applies not only to the children, but to the general population. We are all being inundated with Leftwing Propaganda 24 hours a day. Best article I’ve read on the Church of Climate, with its manipulative – corrupt Priesthood and useful idiot zealot followers. This line perfectly summed up their dogma; “ In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin.” The Church of Climate will have people. They shall be known as Climengelicals. And I thought they were Climinupyourassholes. Quite often Ridicule is the best weapon… Sometimes you simply have to point and laugh!!! I add my kudos to the author of this essay on a very well written piece. Net Zero, renewables and their benefactor, the Church of Climate Alarmism, all benefit from the fact that the alarmist narrative is not a formally organized or recognized religion or church in the usual sense of the words. Thus, they are able to escape the separation of church and state mandated in the U.S. Constitution. This benefit helps them receive financial support at taxpayer expense with too little objection from the latter, although Trump now appears to be a threat to that financial support. The trolls here at WUWT ignore the problems with wind and solar energy involving physics, toxic waste, and other matters. Thus, they provide the evidence of the religious and cult-like nature of so-called renewable energy. The same goes for the climate narrative itself—the disconfirming science that shoots down the scare doesn’t matter anymore. Anyone promoting the disconfirmation is guilty of heresy and Orwellian thought-crime. It is fortunate heretics aren’t burnt at the stake anymore. And anyone familiar with the novel knows what happened to Winston Smith in Orwell’s 1984. The excessive amounts that electricity that users in the UK, Germany, California and elsewhere must pay on their bills can be viewed as tithes to this church. These tithes are the punishment for the sins of all of us against Holy Mother Earth and her climatic and environmental systems. Never mind that the Earth is getting greener. The decisions of the High Priests are final. I too worry that that climate alarmism will make a roaring comeback if the Democrats retake the U.S. Congress in 2026 and/or the White House in 2028. As much as I would prefer not to say this, never underestimate the ability of the U.S. voter to make bad decisions. The alarmists are like a predator just waiting in the wings to pounce on its prey when the opportunity presents itself. This is what could potentially happen when too little or no effort is made to educate the masses on the problems with renewables and the climate scare. Most of them probably don’t care enough to look into the issues themselves anyway. We will just have to wait and see what happens. Underlying all of this is an excessively high level of arrogance, egotism and misallocated self-righteousness found in the High Priests and believers that are probably nothing new in human history. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL. Trump was a putz first term for not allowing Happer to do the red team/blue team debate about climate. If people knew the facts ideological zealots would be relegated as laughing stocks to be shamed for their idiocy. I have to wonder. With all the different life forms on this planet, can Mother Earth be considered a virgin? Excellent !

Shame is the only way I can see the ideological disconnects from reality being broken. Their egoistic belief in the nobility and superiority of their position is impossible to influence because ideology has replaced reason. Why reason doesn’t work on them. The sheer idiocy of their beliefs needs to be called out at every opportunity. Climate denier shaming keeps them in their lane so maybe calling them climate idiots could get their egos to wake up. Shame augmented with ridicule. I caught this typo (corrected here) in the last sentence of the first paragraph under the sub-heading “Climate as Theology” in the above article: “. . . This durability is not rational. It is moral amoral, ideological and ultimately theological.” Otherwise, a great article! The Package Deal I’ve been noticing this for ages. Any “progressives” that don’t sign on to the “whole package” are committing sacrilege, risking excommunication from “the movement”. Very nice Tilak. This is what I have been saying though not nearly as eloquent as you. We don’t have a climate problem, we don’t have a science problem we do have a government problem. Government at all levels need to be called out for lying and cheating. As I have said before take away the strong arm of government and the problem goes away. It is that simple. The fanatics pushing CAGW are completely powerless and meaningless without the force of government. Take away the strong arm of government and these guys would be forced to defend their fanatic declarations with actual science and the observations to prove it. They have nothing and no one knows that better than them. On one level, this climate thing has a religious flavour. Have you noticed how religions use logic when it suits them, and dogma when it doesn’t. You can have a logical discussion with a believer up to a point, but you can never take it past that point. It would be good if the same did not occur in science, but as Max Planck and others have pointed out, it has gone on for centuries. It used to be called gatekeeping, but climate scientists have used the opaqueness of models to take it to a whole new dimension. In science, at least the facts can get through in the end, albeit often decades late. That is why, as others have pointed out, Net Zero is being separated from climate science. Both are crumbling, but in different ways. If connected, when one falls they both fall. By separating them, the blob (for want of a better word) hope they can save at least one. There is still a lot of hard work ahead – the honest people now have to fight on two fronts. There have always been fashions in thought, just as in everything else, including clothing, architecture, and building and automotive design. It is never rational, but the adherents follow it nonetheless, no matter how ridiculous it makes them look. The now-collapsing thinking regarding so-called “climate change” and the degree to which it is apocalyptic is just another example of this human weakness. There are many champagne socialists among the climate alarmists; in fact, few people would be surprised to find that they dominate the movement. They have little to lose by espousing the CAGW theory and many stand to profit from it either through career advancement and/or financially. So as long as their beliefs are being questioned or being abandoned completely, they will fight like tigers to keep propping them up because the stakes are too high not to do so. You can understand a lot of liberalism by recognizing liberals’ deep need to feel superior — intellectually, but also morally. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Whoever wins… we lose? Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts If Warner Bros. Discovery was only a movie house, it would have had one of its best years ever. Two of its films (One Battle After Another and Sinners) are front-runners for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it had a string of critical hits and box-office successes with Superman, Weapons, and A Minecraft Movie. But the company is a media conglomerate that counts HBO and CNN among the brands it owns, and it took on lots of debt; its box-office success in 2025 is not enough to make up for its financial struggles. This year, the company found itself up for auction. After over a hundred years as a major Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. fate seemed unclear. Now months into a process that Netflix formally won, Paramount still hopes to come out on top with a hostile bid. This week even, the billionaire Larry Ellison, whose son, David, controls Paramount, offered a personal guarantee for the deal. The bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is a business story that morphed into a future-of-entertainment story and then recently took an ominous turn into politics. President Donald Trump weighed in, saying he would be “involved” in deciding who wins, which put every party on alert that Trump might be particularly watching what happens to CNN, a cable network he has called “the least trusted name in news” and a “political arm of the Democrat Party.” Trump has sued ABC News, CBS News, the BBC, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. His administration has federally defunded PBS and NPR, and put pressure on networks to cancel late-night shows. In the Warner Bros. Discovery bidding war, Trump has hinted that he leans toward Paramount, and this week brought new claims of political interference of the news at the Ellison-run Paramount. 60 Minutes pulled a segment on the harsh conditions at a prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans earlier this year. Bari Weiss, the new head of CBS News, said the story needed more work even though it had apparently been fact-checked and legally vetted, not to mention promoted on air. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to the Atlantic film critic David Sims about what the outcome of this deal might mean for movie lovers, especially those who hope to keep going to movies in theaters. And we talk to our staff writer Frank Foer about Trump’s increasing influence on the media landscape and his subtle campaign to disappear CNN. The following is a transcript of the episode: Hanna Rosin: I know we’re months from the Oscars, but will you name your top-three picks for Best Picture? David Sims: In terms of who I think may well win? Rosin: Mm. Sims: Or who I want to win? Rosin: Mm. Sims: (Laughs.) Rosin: I think I’m gonna go with want. I think I’m gonna go with want. That’s— Sims: I’ve got the same pick for both, honestly, is I do think One Battle After Another will win out; I would say Sinners and Hamnet are the other sort of big players right now. Rosin: I was hoping you would say One Battle After Another and Sinners, only so I could have a smooth transition into the conversation I want to have with you. Sims: Absolutely. [Music] Rosin: One Battle After Another and Sinners, two front-runners for the Oscar for Best Picture, both came out of the same studio this year: Warner Bros. Sims: Those are movies from very established filmmakers with big stars in them. Leonardo DiCaprio (as Bob Ferguson in One Battle After Another): My name is Bob Ferguson. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of me, all right? I was part of French 75. Sims: But they were for grown-ups. These are R-rated movies. Michael B. Jordan (as Elijah “Smoke” Moore in Sinners): Y’all Klan? Jack O’Connell (as Remmick in Sinners): Sir. We believe in equality and music. Sims: They were going up against more established franchise stuff, and they dominated the conversation. Rosin: This is Atlantic movie critic David Sims. Sims: They did well in every kind of space. Rosin: It was also the same studio that made Weapons, Superman, and A Minecraft Movie— critical hits, along with box-office successes—movies for families and movies for families who like Paul Thomas Anderson. Sims: They had the kind of year studio executives dream of. Rosin: So what better way to end a banner year at Warner Bros. Pictures than by selling it? This fall, Warner Bros. Discovery—which includes all of its movie studios, HBO, DC Comics, and a bunch of other things—announced that it was on the market. An initial front-runner was Paramount. Sims: So Paramount was there—it was an existing movie studio, recently bought by David Ellison after he spent years trying to take it over. He’s the son of Larry Ellison. He’s a very, very rich tech billionaire. Rosin: But their bid was rejected. So Paramount kept submitting more bids, and those were all rejected too. Meanwhile (Netflix sound effect plays.) Netflix was also interested and swooped in. Wolf Blitzer (from CNN): New this morning, Netflix has inked a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to buy the iconic TV and movie studio and its streaming assets, including HBO. We should mention— [Music] Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. The bidding war for Warner Bros. is a business story that’s morphing into an entertainment story and then took an ominous turn into politics. President Donald Trump: So we’ll have to see what happens. Rosin: Recently, President Donald Trump weighed in on the matter, suggesting that he was personally interested in the outcome—which adds a whole new layer of complication. Trump: And I’ll be involved in that decision too. But they have a very big market share. For those of us who care more about the movies? The truth is that both options might make them a little worse—for different reasons. And for those of us who care most about democracy? It would not be the first time that the president has inserted himself into the business of media. We’ll talk to staff writer Frank Foer about that later. But first, critic David Sims on what he pays the most attention to: What does this Warner Bros. Discovery deal mean for the movies when the number of big movie studios just keeps shrinking? Sims: Obviously, this is a looming nightmare that Hollywood has been worried about for longer than the last few months. And for the last few years, Warner Bros., which is one part of a big conglomeration of TV networks and other stuff has been a company that’s sort of laden with debt and has had some bad corporate owners in the past, that’s been passed around, so a lot of people have been waiting to see who will swoop in to sort of salvage the company or transform it. And the fear’s always been, It’ll get sucked up too. The Hollywood studios will continue to sort of condense into a bigger and bigger blob, which, really, it means nothing good for art, unfortunately. Rosin: Okay, well, slow that down ’cause you said “fear”—you’re separating, already, in your answer quality from financial stability. So it was a studio that made good movies but was financially not stable, I guess, for a while, so why “fear”—why don’t we see this as rescuing Warner Bros.? Sims: Well, Warner Bros., the movie studio itself, there’s not a huge profit issue there. That’s the sort of jewel of the company, along with HBO, which is part of this corporate consideration. It’s the other stuff that’s been the problem, and David Zaslav, who’s been running the company for a few years at this point, since it merged with Discovery, has been trying to cut fat. He’s laid people off. He’s canceled whole movies outright. He’s been running it pretty lean, and I think everyone in the industry has been watching and sort of noting that he’s clearly preparing to get acquired. Now, in the old days, Warner Bros. used to be owned by AT&T. Before then, it was owned by AOL. Back in the day, Coca-Cola used to own one of the movie studios. Big companies would own movie studios ’cause it was fun to own a movie studio—you would get to be a player in Hollywood, and you would have glitz and glamour. But now, it feels like the only companies that want these movie studios are other movie studios. Rosin: So let me ask you: If, for years and years, big companies have owned movie studios, why is this moment such a big deal? Why do people like you talk about it with trepidation in their voices—nd “people like you,” I mean people who love movies and movie theaters and just the whole tradition of Hollywood? Why is this any different than Coca-Cola or anybody else? Sims: Well, so it feels like there’s two outcomes to this Warner Bros. deal, it seems, and both of them are causing agita for different reasons. [Music] Sims: If Paramount, which is another big studio, had bought Warner Bros., you have what happened to Disney and Fox, probably, happening again, so Fox still exists in some form, as a sort of subsidiary of Disney—t releases a few movies a year—but you’ve kind of dried up one of the wells of big movie production in Hollywood. If that happens with Paramount owning Warner Bros., once again, you feel the pool of big movies shrinking in Hollywood. You feel this sort of competition shrinking. Now, Netflix is this kind of different beast because they operate a different model. They’ve made money a different way. Obviously, they’re all in on streaming. So far, they’ve sort of communicated publicly, like, Oh, no, no, no. Warner Bros. is a different business than ours, and we wouldn’t wanna kill its theatrical industry. But because Netflix has been so uniquely aggressive about sort of getting their movies onto TV rather than in theaters, there’s this just huge anxiety amongst people like me and people who make movies that the movie-theater industry just cannot survive losing that many movies a year, if that’s where this is going. Rosin: Why are theatrical—this is not obvious to me. It seems to me—what I care about is that good movies get made. Why is theatergoing the lifeblood of good movies? Does it change the incentive structure of what kind of movies you make and how good or creative or original they are? Sims: Possibly. Look, Netflix has made good movies, but there is a sort of style to a lot of Netflix movies—the more sort of generic stuff that they put out: the rom-coms and the sort of medium-size dramas, whatever—that feels like the movie’s a little more designed to be ignored. Rosin: Mm. Sims: Now— Rosin: Ah, now I understand it. (Laughs.) That feels like a real concern—if you’re creating movies that you know people are going to be checking their phone while watching. Sims: I think when you talk to the sort of older guard in Hollywood, who are especially worried about the mortality of theaters, there’s also just this feeling of, like, When it’s gone, it won’t come back. [Music] Sims: And all of those companies are—they’ve been battered by COVID, they were hurt by the strikes, which really reduced the amount of output lately, and they’re kind of hanging on by a thread right now. Big movies will come out and do well and kind of demonstrate that audiences are fine going to the theater for something they’re interested in. But it’s tougher for a sort of mid-sized or smaller movie to break out in the ways that they used to—which is why, again, one reason that something like Sinners or One Battle, those films catching on with people is heartening to see because it kind of defies the prediction that companies like Netflix are making of, Ah, well, that old model, that’s sort of dinosaur stuff, and people prefer to just have an a la carte selection at home of whatever they can watch. Rosin: So we’ve been discussing the Netflix outcome. Tell me what happened with Paramount and what’s the Paramount outcome. How do you see that differently than what you’ve just described? Sims: I think one reason the Netflix bid seems to have won is that Netflix was cool with Warner Bros., the company, sort of splitting up and its cable channels—these sort of less profitable units—getting spun off and turned into a division that can be dealt with elsewhere or sold off or who knows. And Netflix would take control of kind of the big properties: Warner Bros., HBO, things like that. Paramount seems to want the whole kit and caboodle; they want everything. They’re willing to pay a lot for it. And it’s a little harder to understand why, outside of, I guess, just this notion of, We need to be as big as possible to compete. Paramount on its own used to be a very venerable—it’s still venerable, but now they don’t have a Marvel, and they don’t have the kind of streaming service that Netflix or HBO is. So if they can just kind of grow by acquisition, grow by expanding into new areas of storytelling—they can make more comic-book movies, whatever—that’s their argument for: This is the best way to survive. That might be true for Paramount. It might lead to a lot of layoffs and a lot of consolidation as well. There’s literally just less movies in theaters than there used to be. And so consolidation, you imagine more of that. Rosin: Right. So whatever the details, you see this as a lose-lose for Hollywood. Sims: Oh God, I hate to be so pessimistic. I’m usually not the pessimist, I will say. But it’s tough for me to see either of these being smooth. Both of these will be strange corporate maneuvers. It currently seems like the Netflix thing will happen. But, obviously, Paramount’s exploring this idea of a hostile bid. Combining Netflix and HBO, you’ve got two of the biggest streaming services—that’s a whole mess that maybe regulators won’t object to. There’s the Trump factor of terms of he maybe prefers a bidder—maybe he doesn’t, though? A lot of the reporting seems to suggest maybe he wasn’t as swayed by the Ellisons as the Ellisons thought he would be. Who knows? All of this is very difficult to foresee. And I think Warner Bros. did not really see this coming. The old rumor was that they wanted Universal, who’s another studio, to get them, and those two powers would combine into something very, very powerful. This is weird in a new way, and it’s kind of like the story of Hollywood of, every year, there’s sort of a new evolution of weird that everyone in the industry just has to wrestle with. Rosin: David, thank you so much for joining us today. Sims: Happy to. Anytime. [Music] Rosin: After the break, Frank Foer on what happens if Trump does intervene on this deal. And remember: Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t just in the movie business. They also own CNN. [Break] Rosin: The movies are just one part of this Warner Bros. Discovery deal. As we’ll hear from staff writer Frank Foer, politics is another. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, President Donald Trump privately told people that he wanted this deal to be a competition, to have one side bid against the other for his approval of the deal. Frank Foer: Because, ultimately, in order to get a merger of this size through, it needs to be blessed by the U.S. government. And it seems like the biggest condition that he’s laid out there is CNN. Rosin: CNN. Okay, so you think that’s his main interest. What does he want from CNN? Foer: So Warner Bros. owns CNN, and I think that he hates CNN, that he says it’s run by corrupt, terrible people, and he wants to see them out. Does that mean that he wants to see CNN kind of left on the side of the road to wither and die? Does it mean that he wants the new buyer to come in and renovate CNN in the same sort of way that the Ellisons have come in to CBS News and installed Bari Weiss and to turn that into a different type of news-gathering organization? It’s unclear. I don’t think Trump knows. I think he’s waiting for the bidders to come and present him with the best prize. Rosin: Okay. I think I need to understand how unusual this level of intervention is. What is the president’s usual official role in a big merger like this? Foer: So the whole United States government is set up to avoid this type of direct political meddling. [Music] Foer: We have agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, which were set up almost a hundred years ago, or more than a hundred years ago in the case of the FTC. And they were supposed to be independent agencies, where you had a set of commissioners—you would have three from the party in charge, two from the out party—where they would make decisions in a relatively bipartisan, technocratic way, in the best interest of the government, so that you didn’t have presidents coming in and picking winners and losers. But I think it’s pretty clear that, in the end, he’s got a little bit of a rooting interest for Paramount, but he doesn’t wanna make it seem as if he’s putting his thumb on the scale, because that would be bad—that would send bad signals to the world, bad signals to the market. And so, even if he may gesture in the direction of Paramount, I think even Donald Trump knows that he needs to make it look like an open and fair competition. Rosin: Got it. So he’s, basically, somewhat aware of the kinds of criticisms that a person like Frank Foer at The Atlantic might make, is, This is inappropriate. Foer: Right. This is a transaction, and so Warner Bros. has shareholders who have to approve a merger themselves and sign up for a deal; they initially signed up to give their company to Netflix. And really, there is a bidding war going on, and part of the bidding war is that—what Paramount says that it brings to the table is that it can get the approval of the president of the United States; it can make it a much more painless transaction than the Netflix purchase. Rosin: It’s like they’ve already acceded to a world in which the president’s approval or disapproval actually makes a difference in how you do business. It’s like we live in that world now. Foer: Yeah, yeah. And Netflix understands that too; that’s why Ted Sarandos went and visited—the CEO of Netflix went and visited Donald Trump in the Oval Office himself. This is the world that we live in. Rosin: So let’s play out the scenario under Trump. What moves has he already made to exert influence over media? Foer: Right. So we could look at what’s happened to The Washington Post. [Music] Foer: During the first Trump term, Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post—or he bought it before Trump—but he recreated the paper, essentially, as a resistance paper: Democracy dies in darkness. Jeff Bezos: It is a mistake for any elected official, in my opinion, to attack media and journalists. I believe that— (Audience claps.) Foer: And Trump sees this happening, and he sees the Super Bowl ad they make. Tom Hanks (in a Washington Post commercial): Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free. (Music swells.) Foer: And he starts to tweet about how Jeff Bezos is a corrupt guy and that he’s gonna take revenge against Amazon, which he says is doing all sorts of unfair things. TV anchor (from CNBC): President Trump going after Amazon again, this time in a series of tweets. He writes: “So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN.” Lobbyists for Amazon— Foer: So Bezos sees this happening and he, I think, either consciously or subconsciously, decides that he’s gonna walk away from this resistance persona, and he’s gonna recreate the editorial board of The Washington Post, which he more directly controls, as being something that’s more politically sympathetic to Donald Trump. TV anchor (from CNN): —after the publisher announced that the newspaper will not endorse a candidate for president. That’s the first time they have not done so in 36 years of presidential elections. The Post itself— Foer: Or to take another example, we saw the way in which Brendan Carr, the [chairman] of the FCC, said stations that were carrying Jimmy Kimmel—that because of everything that Jimmy Kimmel had said about Charlie Kirk, that they were gonna pay a price. Brendan Carr (on The Benny Show): —changes that we’ve seen, but, frankly, when you see stuff like this—look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Foer: And it turned out that a lot of these companies were in the process of undergoing mergers and consolidations—they had a lot of deals sitting in front of the Trump administration—and so they heard his message, and they said, Okay, we’re pulling Jimmy Kimmel from the air. Rosin: Right, although they did say the decision to pull Kimmel wasn’t actually influenced by FCC communication. But, okay, so let’s overlay those dynamics onto the Warner Bros. sale. What does it look like? Play out what it could look like. Foer: So we’ve talked about CNN, which, I think, is kind of the most vulnerable asset there. I think that— Rosin: Wait, so what happens to CNN? Just—this is hypothetical. Foer: Right. So, hypothetically, they could either say that, We’re gonna buy CNN as part of this deal, and we’re just gonna kill CNN. Rosin: Paramount could, if Paramount— Foer: Paramount could do that. Rosin: —or Netflix. Foer: Or Netflix. Netflix doesn’t do news, and so they could just say, You know what? If it’s a cost of doing this transaction that you’re forcing us to buy CBS—anything is possible in this sort of world where these types of sums of money are on the table, and there’s an enormous amount of flexibility. The other scenario—and we’re seeing this with CBS News, which is kind of what I’d call the Orbánification scenario, where Viktor Orbán is the head of state in Hungary, and what he’s done is, essentially, ensured that the biggest media properties in that country are sold to his allies and cronies, who, in turn, neuter those networks or turn them into propaganda apparatus. And so there’s some possibility that that happens. But if Paramount decided to go through with that, it would be painful for Paramount. Rosin: But why? We just had a perfect model for that, which is: Bari Weiss takes over CBS; Erika Kirk is the first interview. Plenty of people got fired, but it happened. Foer: It happens; it’s not unthinkable. But CNN is different than CBS. CBS News is something that aims to be straight down the middle. CNN, I think, aims to be straight down the middle, but is, in fact, kind of an anti-Trump network. Rosin: I see, so it would be more obvious and much more of a fight. Foer: Yeah. You would lose more viewership that way. You’d lose hosts who, I think, have built personas around criticizing Trump. It would be messy. Rosin: Right. Okay, so that’s instability for us who work in this industry. But do the shifts in journalism matter for anyone else? Foer: Right, so if you take The Washington Post. [Music] Foer: The Washington Post editorial page had limited reach. But in terms of kind of national voices, there were three national newspapers, three editorial boards. You have The Wall Street Journal, which is already kind of right-wing, and then you take another one and you make it right wing, you’ve changed a substantial portion of the opinion space in national newspaper land. There are only three meaningful cable networks. One of them is already pro-Trump. You take another one off the table—you’re changing a substantial percentage of cable news. A democracy is basically only as good as the information that its citizenry gets, and so we are undergoing this long-term crisis where the quality of information that citizens get has been diminished—it’s more likely to be manipulated by algorithms or by outside actors—and that, if we ever have any chance of having a democratic revival in this country, we need there to be quality sources of information. Rosin: Sometimes I think back to the first days that Jimmy Kimmel was fired and what a shock that was to the country because that was the first time that such an overt pressure happened from the administration, which had such an obvious consequence for a well-known media figure. But then he was reinstated. So is there any hope in that? Foer: Yeah, I think that there is hope in that, because there was a public backlash. I think that it was a moment where they pushed too hard, and they went too far, and I think a lot of people who may have otherwise cowered or turned away felt compelled to push back. But, on the other hand, I just look at things relative to where they were in the first Trump term and the whole tenor of conversation. And in the first Trump term, I think a lot of media looked at outrageous things, and they responded with outrage. And here, this is not just because of all these larger economic tides that we’re talking about, but there is a greater numbness that, I think, prevails. It’s less red-blooded. It’s less full-throated. It’s more numb. Rosin: Thank you, Frank, for joining us today. Foer: My pleasure. [Music] Rosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West.

Title: Bitcoin’s 2025 review: The “violent transformation” hidden behind the year’s deceptively flat price chart

Bitcoin's tumultuous year saw regulatory embrace, miner crises, and Wall Street's long-awaited entry into the crypto realm. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. 2025 delivered a brutal lesson in market structure for Bitcoin. The year began with political momentum and drifted into a summer of aggressive policy signals. Yet, it snapped into one of the sharpest boom-to-bust sequences in the asset’s history. By December, the price had round-tripped, leaving the asset flat for the year. But the flat chart masked a violent transformation underneath. While Wall Street banks finally opened their doors and ETFs vacuumed up record capital, the network’s physical infrastructure faced a solvency crisis. CryptoSlate has compiled some of the major trends that defined the market in 2025 below: President Trump moved from election promises to execution. On March 6, the White House signed Executive Order 14233, formally establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The US considers untapped financial resources, like tariff revenues and gold revaluation, to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. The order consolidated forfeited federal bitcoin holdings into a dedicated US Digital Asset Stockpile, ending the era of sporadic auctions by the US Marshals. A week later, lawmakers introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2025 to codify this framework. This legislation transformed the US government from a net seller into a strategic holder, signaling to global sovereigns that Bitcoin is a recognized reserve asset. Following this lead, states like Texas and Pennsylvania launched similar initiatives. Internationally, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland began exploring sovereign accumulation. In the corporate sector, the “Bitcoin Treasury” trend accelerated. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and over 100 other public companies now hold more than 1 million BTC on their balance sheets, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sam Callahan, the director of Strategy and Research at Oranje BTC, explained that these entities embraced BTC because it “is a superior reserve asset to gold.” According to him: “Bitcoin is digital. Bitcoin is fully auditable in real time, and can be transferred instantly. Bitcoin has an absolute fixed supply. Gold’s supply will continue to expand, forever, from ongoing mining.” Another major milestone that defined the year was the traditional financial regulatory environment that shifted to accommodate Bitcoin. Over the past year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its sister financial organizations, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have made significant regulatory progress that has enshrined Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. For context, the CFTC approved Bitcoin as a valid margin in regulated derivatives markets, and the US Federal Housing also recognized the top crypto as an asset for mortgage qualification in the United States. However, the most significant changes came from the banking regulators, which fully embraced Bitcoin. FSOC dropped Bitcoin from its vulnerabilities list in 2025, coordinating with the GENIUS Act and OCC bank charters to normalize institutional access. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued Interpretative Letter 1188. This document clarified that national banks can execute “riskless principal” crypto transactions. Previously, banks hesitated to broker trades because they did not want to hold volatile assets on their balance sheets. A “riskless principal” trade solves this. It allows a bank to buy an asset from a seller and resell it to a buyer immediately. The bank facilitates liquidity but never holds market risk. This letter, combined with conditional charter approvals for firms like BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Ripple National Trust Bank, effectively integrated crypto into the US banking stack. Due to these regulatory milestones, banks that hitherto treated Bitcoin as a reputational risk have changed their stance. In 2025, they began fighting for market share. Notably, CryptoSlate previously reported that 60% of the top 25 US banks now pursue strategies to sell, safeguard, or advise on Bitcoin. This shows that major financial institutions like PNC Bank, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and others opened their operations to enable Bitcoin trading and custody for interested clients. PNC's agency model with Coinbase spotlights a secure path for Bitcoin adoption amid complex regulations. Considering this level of growth, Bitcoin analyst Joe Consorti argued that BTC had become “too big for Wall Street to ignore.” Away from the banks embrace of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market also provided strong performance for industry players this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the ETF landscape. This year, IBIT has attracted over $25 billion in inflows, ranking it sixth among all US ETFs. Crucially, investors used Bitcoin differently from gold. While the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) saw inflows as gold hit record highs, Bitcoin ETF inflows persisted even as BTC's price stagnated. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's ETF analyst, said: “IBIT is the only ETF on the 2025 Flow Leaderboard with a negative return for the year…That's a really good sign long term IMO. If you can do $25 billion in bad year imagine the flow potential in good year.” Indeed, BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, had described BTC as one of this “year’s biggest investment themes.” Considering this, market analysts explained that investors treated Bitcoin as a structural accumulation play rather than a momentum trade. Bitcoin's evolution reflects in off-chain ETF growth and reduced on-chain activity despite decentralized roots. Meanwhile, other positive developments within the ETF complex saw the US SEC approve “in-kind” creations and redemptions for spot ETFs. This technical change enabled Authorized Participants (APs) to swap actual BTC for ETF shares, rather than first converting to cash. At the same time, the financial regulator also allowed options on IBIT to go live. This provided hedgers and basis traders with the necessary tools to manage risk, completing the institutional derivatives stack. Unsurprisignly, BTC's price action followed its own volatile script. In early October, Bitcoin broke resistance to set a new all-time high above $125,000. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. While the government and ETFs bought, long-term holders sold. On-chain data showed that wallets holding Bitcoin for 155 days or more contributed heavily to the October rally. This distribution, combined with macro-deleveraging, drove prices back under $90,000, which represented an over 30% correction. Meanwhile, global macroeconomic conditions complicated the picture. The US economy has seen significant Federal Reserve rates cut this year, with some arging that these moves were a positive for BTC price performance. However, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) simultaneously inched rates higher, tightening global liquidity and squeezing speculative carry trades. Japan's monetary shift scrutinizes yen's role in crypto trades, hinting at broader market challenges. Still, despite this market conditions, Bitcoin advocates believe the top crypto would shine. Pierre Rochard, the CEO of the Bitcoin Bond Company, said: “Bitcoin can be understood as a global “savings reservoir” for excess capital: when interest rates are low, liquidity is abundant, and high expected ROIC real investments are scarce, savings migrate into Bitcoin because it is a finite scarcity, a global digital open source network with a fixed 21 million supply.” While Wall Street integrated Bitcoin, the miners securing the network faced a crisis. Following the October peak, BTC's hashrate collapsed from a peak of 1.3 zetahash per second (zh/s) to 852 EH/S recently. It has recovered to 1.09 zh/s as fof press time. Hashrate is the lifeblood of Bitcoin security, which is used to drive the network trust. The higher the hashrate, the harder it is for any attacker to rewrite Bitcoin’s ledger. So, as BTC's price corrected below $90,000, older machines became a liability to Bitcoin miners. This is because the total cost to produce 1 BTC (including depreciation) for the average listed miner hovers near $137,800. With spot prices trading at a $47,000 discount to production cost, margins evaporated. To survive, miners pivoted to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). Seven of the top ten miners now report revenue from AI contracts. Ranking the top Bitcoin miners by AI revenue and hashrate reveals how the industry’s leaders are redefining scale. Google emerged as a key financier in this shift. Rather than acquiring mining firms outright, Google provided credit support to help miners upgrade their infrastructure for AI workloads. This transition signals a permanent change in the industry: miners are evolving into hybrid energy-compute centers to hedge against Bitcoin volatility. Despite all of the institutional progress and positives of the past year, the psychological fears remained. 2025 was the year of integration. The “plumbing” is no longer theoretical. ETFs now function with in-kind efficiency, banks possess the regulatory clearance to trade, and the U.S. government formally holds the asset. However, the miner insolvency crisis and the LTH sell-off proved that structural adoption does not guarantee “up only” price action. Bitcoin is now fully exposed to the ruthless efficiency of macro markets. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: 2025 Review: these are the 10 most important events of the year, according to AFP

A year full of upheavals, conflicts and developments with a global footprint is captured in the report of the Agence France-Presse (AFP) for 2025. From Donald Trump‘s tumultuous return to the White House and the fragile balances in the Middle East and Ukraine, to the social uprisings of Generation Z, colossal investments in artificial intelligence and record-breaking extreme weather events, ten events marked the year and shaped the international landscape, highlighting an era of intense uncertainty and profound change. Here is the review of 2025: Attack of protectionism, mass deportations of illegal immigrants, dismantling entire sections of the federal government… After returning in January to the White House for a second term, Republican Donald Trump has embarked on a barrage of measures under his doctrine of “America first”, making extensive use of executive orders, though the judiciary blocked some of his decisions. Disregarding, according to opponents, fundamental rights and other powers, he targeted opponents, sent militias into major cities led by Democrats, attempted to intimidate the media, and fought diversity and inclusion programs. He also developed intense diplomatic activity, with more or less success. Polls, however, show growing dissatisfaction among Americans on economic issues, especially the cost of living. Sound defeats in local polls have put his party in a vulnerable position ahead of the midterm presidential election in the fall of 2026. US pressure resulted in a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, two years after the devastating war in the Gaza Strip erupted following an unprecedented attack by the Islamist Palestinian movement Hamas on 7 October 2023 on Israeli soil. The ceasefire has allowed for a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, the exchange of the last hostages held alive in Gaza for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and increased humanitarian aid entering Gaza, although that aid still falls significantly short of needs, according to the UN and non-governmental organizations. Israel is awaiting the return of one last hostage body before it begins consultations on the second phase of the ceasefire, a stage that, under the terms of the U.S.- and U.N.-endorsed plan, must lead to the demilitarization of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped that this second phase would begin “very soon, but violence continues to rock that territory, with both parties accusing each other of ceasefire violations. Regional tensions continue with continued Israeli strikes on the strongholds of the Shiite Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. Iran was also hit by Israeli and US raids on its nuclear facilities during a 12-day war in June with Israel, which erupted from an Israeli attack. In September, Israel targeted Hamas officials in an unprecedented attack in Qatar. Donald Trump’s return to power marked the first serious efforts aimed at ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The praise and blame of the US president fluctuated between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. In February, Donald Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president in front of cameras and inside the Oval Office, accusing him of being ungrateful to the United States. Direct talks between Russians and Ukrainians in Istanbul and then a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska failed to produce any concrete progress toward peace, and Washington announced sanctions against the Russian oil sector in October. International negotiations were nevertheless held in late November based on a US draft, the initial version of which was considered by Kiev and its European allies to be too favourable to Moscow. After a new round of talks with Trump’s envoys in December, Ukraine said “progress” had been made, though the issue of Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory remains at an impasse. On the front, the Russian military has continued its slow advance into the east, after completely pushing Ukrainian forces out of the Russian border region of Kursk in March. Moscow has stepped up its strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and the Ukrainian railway network, while Kiev is targeting oil facilities in Russia. Citing trade deals unfavorable to his country, Donald Trump announced in waves additional tariffson products imported into the United States, which varied depending on countries or zones of origin. It also imposed specific customs duties on sectors considered strategic (steel, aluminum or copper). As the targeted countries considered or implemented trade retaliation, they began tough negotiations that resulted in numerous agreements, such as with the European Union or, in late October, with China, marking the beginning of a truce in a conflict that shook the global economy. Bilateral negotiations were instead suspended with Canada after an anti-protectionist ad that the US president found offensive. Pushing to lower the cost of living for Americans, Donald Trump agreed in mid-November to cancel customs tariffs on certain foods, such as imported coffee and imported beef. Robert Francis Prevost became on 8 May, at the age of 69, the first American pope, following the death of his predecessor, Francis, to whom he was an adviser. The white smoke, announcing the election of the 267th head of the Catholic Church, rose over the Sistine Chapel after a brief conclave of cardinals that lasted less than 24 hours. Smiling and unassuming, Prevost, born in Chicago and counted among the moderate cardinals, took the name Leo XIV. The new pontiff, who was for nearly 20 years a missionary in Peru, whose citizenship he has taken, continues his predecessor’s work with social action for the poor, immigrants and ecology. At the same time, he also gave reassurances to conservative circles, allowing a traditional mass to resume in the Vatican after three years of restrictions. He ruled out in the short term the ordination of women as deacons or the recognition of same-sex marriage. In Asia, Africa, or Latin America, young people of Generation Z (under 30) have multiplied mobilizations for improved living conditions and against social media exclusion or elite corruption. They held marches in Peru against the growing insecurity and order of politicians, or in Morocco, where the authorities launched efforts in social sectors, but also prosecuted more than 2,000 people. In other countries, the protests, which were violently suppressed, developed into a wider challenge to power: after riots in Nepal, Maoist Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli had no choice but to resign. In Madagascar, mobilisation led to the military overthrowing President Andri Rajoelina, who fled abroad. In Tanzania, young people participated en masse in post-election protests, which were drowned in blood. The pirate manga One Piece flag (a skull and crossbones with a straw hat), often carried by protesters, became an international symbol of the fight against oppression on social media. Tech giants and niche startups are spending increasingly colossal sums to fund the frenzied development of artificial intelligence. According to US research and advisory firm Gartner, global spending on artificial intelligence is expected to reach around $1.5 trillion in 2025 (+50% in a year) and exceed $2 trillion next year. The sector’s astronomical stock market valuations -those of US microprocessor giant Nvidia had at one point surpassed the unprecedented $5 trillion level- are, however, causing fears in the markets of a potential speculative bubble. The concerns caused by artificial intelligence were moreover fuelled by numerous examples of misinformation, accusations of copyright infringement or mass layoffs, notably at Amazon. The parents of a teenager in California who committed suicide even accused OpenAI’s AI assistant ChatGPT of encouraging their child’s suicide with specific advice. Since then, the startup has stepped up parental controls, and California has enacted legislation that regulates so-called “chatbots.” On October 19, thugs in workmen’s vests broke into the famous Parisian Louvre museum in broad daylight, using a lift normally used for removals, after breaking a glass panel. They then broke into exhibit windows and stole crown jewels, estimated to be worth 88 million euros, all within eight minutes. Escaping on a scooter, they dropped the crown of Empress Eugenia (wife of Napoleon III), which was found damaged. This spectacular burglary at the Louvre was commented on around the world and brought to light the security failings of the world’s most famous museum. Charges have been laid against four men suspected of being part of the burglary group, but no loot has been found so far. Washington has deployed a significant military force off Venezuela since August, officially to combat drug smuggling destined for the United States. A series of strikes have been carried out in recent weeks in the Caribbean and Pacific against vessels suspected of carrying drugs, causing the deaths of about 100 people in operations whose legality is questioned by experts. Caracas sees this as a pretext aimed at overthrowing President Nicolas Maduro and seizing the country’s oil reserves. After arresting an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude on December 10, Washington announced a “complete blockade” of “sanctioned oil tankers” that sail to or from Venezuela. Washington accuses Nicolas Maduro of heading a cartel and offers a $50 million reward for his capture. Killer floods, severe storms. Extreme weather events have succeeded one another, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate deregulation caused by human activity, according to scientists. Cyclone Melissa, one of the most powerful to ever sweep the Caribbean, devastated entire regions of Jamaica and flooded Haiti and Cuba. In Southeast Asia, the Philippines was hit in less than two months by Typhoons Ragasha, Kalmagi and Fung-wong. Vietnam was devastated by storms, floods, and landslides, while two tropical storms claimed hundreds of lives late in the year in Sri Lanka and Indonesia. As temperatures rose, forest fires intensified in Europe, and record forest acres burned during the summer. In the US, fires started by lightning caused the northern section of the famous Grand Canyon in Arizona to close in mid-July for the rest of the tourist season. Explore related questions

Title: Exclusive: Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq’s assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on record

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2025 10:01:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup’s latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco , Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it’s “entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology,” without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company’s president, and other senior leaders “will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,” the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an “independent company,” led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq’s assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.” The deal represents by far Nvidia’s largest purchase ever. The chipmaker’s biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia’s capabilities. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco , Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it’s “entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology,” without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company’s president, and other senior leaders “will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,” the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an “independent company,” led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq’s assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.” The deal represents by far Nvidia’s largest purchase ever. The chipmaker’s biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia’s capabilities. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: The best video essays of 2025 | Sight and Sound
URL: https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2025
Time Published: 2025-12-25T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Now in its ninth year, our annual poll showcases 255 vital video essays, nominated by 72 international voters. The ninth instalment of Sight and Sound’s dedicated poll has brought a record number of participants (72) and video essays (255) mentioned. While the video essay form still escapes definition, and is no longer new or ‘the next big thing’, this data attests that the number and diversity of stakeholders willing to engage with it – creators, critics, scholars, curators, programmers, fans – continues to grow. This year’s poll has moved somewhat closer to parity between three major ecosystems of video essays: (1) academia and film/media criticism (34 voters, 94 distinct video essays mentioned), (2) festivals, museums, and galleries (17 voters, 65 essays mentioned), and (3) social media and YouTube (21 voters, 96 essays mentioned). Perhaps not surprisingly, there is little overlap in what each ecosystem mentions, except among contributors working across more than one sphere. A more interesting question raised by the poll is: which essays get seen and awarded prestige within these circles, by whom, and in what contexts? One of the key concerns resonating across the fields is accessibility. Many contributors emphasised that it was simply impossible to keep up with the gargantuan number of essays screened or published throughout the year. Others argued that seven choices were too few and applied selective parameters, such as not voting for video essays that weren’t published or available online. Such rules, while perfectly justifiable for academia, would make little sense for the art world, since online availability is a no-go for most major festival committees. Moreover, being published online in a respected peer-reviewed journal doesn’t guarantee visibility. Even the most successful scholarly video essays in this poll have relatively low view numbers. We may attribute this to increasing specialisation and fragmentation, the decline of Vimeo (still the main platform for videographic criticism), and a general lack of time and energy amid today’s precarious ‘dark academia’. Yet in the world of YouTube, these numbers would likely prevent voters from even considering such works. In this environment of overabundance, uneven availability, and dispersed notions of quality, we naturally gravitate towards what is closest: an essay encountered at a workshop or festival, one tied to a project we follow, or one that surfaces in our personalised feeds. This approach is, given the circumstances, perfectly understandable – some may even call it a survival strategy. But we should also consider whether this economy of personal connections, chance encounters, and algorithmic offerings sacrifices something essential: debate within a shared context. Within each of the three ecosystems, several trends emerge. In the academic/critical sphere, interest in archival and historiographic approaches continues to grow, building on 2024. As voter Alison Peirse notes, ‘videographic criticism is feeling its archival fantasy’. Definitions of what qualifies as archival may vary, but such works were among this year’s most frequently cited. These include the poll’s most-voted essay, The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková (12 votes), and the special issue ‘Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive’ edited by John Gibbs for the journal Movie (11 votes across three essays). One might also argue that another popular special issue, ‘The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias’ edited by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper (11 votes across five essays), carries certain archival inflections. Horror remains a favoured genre, with Peirse herself functioning almost as an archivist of horror tropes (gaining 7 votes across her works), and Lucy Fife Donaldson’s (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly, published in the Monstrum special issue ‘Queer/ing Horror’ (ed. Dayna McLeod), receiving 6 votes. Within the art circuit, several voters stressed the importance of where video essays are watched. Dmitry Frolov, echoing Julian Ross’s categorisation ‘essay films = video essays’, argues that cinemas and contemporary art spaces offer ‘a more immersive encounter with essayistic thought’ – an encounter he sees as increasingly difficult, and thus ‘all the more precious’, in a world ‘whose condition increasingly resembles a catastrophe’. The most-voted work in this ecosystem, Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory (6 votes), exemplifies this immersive experience, and speaks to Tafakory’s enduring cross-sector appeal despite her films often remaining offline years after their premieres. Frolov’s sense of catastrophe also resonates with the prominence of works focusing on Palestine, notably happiness by Fırat Yücel and The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos. On YouTube, the works receiving the most recognition were those tackling pressing contemporary issues in a critical yet highly personal mode. Greater self-reflexivity may echo what Jacob Geller calls a generational shift from earlier YouTubers ‘inspired by film, television, and/or written essays’ to a younger cohort that ‘grew up alongside the video essay’ and now pushes its boundaries. Nonetheless, among the poll’s selections, this self-awareness clearly spans generations. A shared focus on the politics of visibility links works as varied as Lily Alexandre’s Trans Day of Vanishing (6 votes), josh (with parentheses)’s You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) (6 votes), and Big Joel’s You Are into Mousetrap YouTube (4 votes). Josh’s piece in particular illustrates a wider YouTube trend of scrutinising AI models, especially ChatGPT, and their growing presence in daily life. Despite such weighty subjects, Denis Kefallinos notes a concurrent wave of ‘borderline comedy essays,’ which ‘mess with tone’ and toy with ‘absurd subject matter and harsh delivery’ – showing that this self-awareness trend takes many forms. Finally, some quick notes about the distribution of the voters themselves. Of the 72 contributors, 46 were male, 22 female, and 4 non-binary. This imbalance occurred despite our best intentions, yet it doesn’t deviate from the patterns of previous years. The results suggest that it didn’t carry over into any dramatic bias: among the nine most-voted video essays, six were created or co-created by women, many of which feature explicitly feminist, queer, or trans perspectives. As for demographics, the overwhelming majority of voters still come from the global centre, particularly the Anglo-American sphere (the United States leading with 24, followed by the UK with 13 and Canada with 5). Unfortunately, this reflects both the distribution of videographic practice across the world and its capacity to be disseminated in English and presented on prestigious platforms. The participation of experts from semi-peripheral regions (the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania) and countries outside the Euro-American sphere (Iran, Mexico) offers a glimmer of hope, as does the presence of numerous non-English video essays in the poll. Given the breadth of the poll, any selection is inevitably just a cross-section, and in this spirit we’ve selected some notable entries before granting readers the opportunity to dive into the full list and accompanying commentary from our voters. The final results are based on confidentially submitted ballots, all of which are available below. Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková, as a duo, are often mentioned in the poll and contribute greatly to the videographic community, both as creators and archaeologists of the practice. Once again, they seized a popular (and ephemeral) feature of our shared videographic histories to ask “What kind of artefact, if any, is the star wipe?” (Byron Davies), with the whimsical style and acute analysis that characterise their work. Co-winner of the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival’s Audiovisual Essay Competition, this video essay establishes “videographic form as a queer methodology” (Catherine Grant). Formally and discursively, this work succeeds in conveying a “disorienting sense of foreboding made eerie and uncanny through repetition of sound and image” (Dayna McLeod). “Films are carried by the hands of their lovers [through history]; by their shadows” (Amin Komijani and Kasra Karbasi). Awarded as one of the two winners at Marienbad this year, this video essay prolongs Varda’s gesture with finesse and an intimate understanding of the filmmaker’s work. This subtlety takes the form of a voice, that of the videast’s child, and their affectionate dialogue resonating from within the images, inside the images. The impressive Trans Day of Vanishing produces “a raw examination of visibility, vulnerability, and safety” (Denis Kefallinos) as a trans person in public space. Filming outdoors, dissecting surveillance apparatuses, vlogging in the dark, the videast subverts YouTube’s usual codes in favour of an uncanniness that turns our gaze back on us – and makes us anxiously look over our shoulder. Addressing a contemporary concern, this video proposes a way to move beyond moral, cognitive or even political positions criticising the use of LLMs. The argument is simple but deeply potent: “the purpose of writing is to meet with another person” (OutOfCharacters), to communicate. And the way of formulating it, using desktop narration, a format that YouTube’s algorithm doesn’t really like (Queline Meadows), is in line with the principle set out in the video: why not just give it a try, someone might be watching. In Tafakory’s new essay, “we are simultaneously seeing the prison bars and the freedom that the palimpsest points to” (Carlos Natálio). This videographic palimpsest superimposes flowers immortalised by cinema, collected in post-revolution Iranian films she features in all of her works, with ancient manuscripts and their flourishing illuminations. This desktop diary observes “the mediality of the Palestinian genocide, [and proposes] a meditation on what it truly means to witness a live-streamed genocide” (Flavia Dima), questioning the circulation of these images between networks, screens and bodies. How does one incorporate a constant flux of violence and impotence?

Petri Pillar of Garbage Julian Ross Jemma Saunders Dan Schindel Daniel Simpson (Eyebrow Cinema) Shannon Strucci Scout Tafoya Max Tohline César Ustarroz Ilinca Vanau Jiří Žák Barbara Zecchi Fiction writer, video essayist (as SolidArf) & English Professor at Quinnipiac University I revisit Ander Monson’s Essay as Hack often: “I fear for the essay, friends, and its bad reputation.” To me, video essays represent the best of what he considers ‘hacks’ – quirky, audiovisual experiments we keep Frankensteining together to revitalise a genre of writing that students have been taught to fear. What students forget is that essays aren’t just a genre of writing. They’re a genre of thought. The video essay is a flexible medium, one that grants a creator the chance to collage home video, guerrilla filmmaking, docupoetics, play, and personal narrative to land at a thesis that is both deeply specific and widely enlightening. What feels particularly urgent about the medium in 2025 is how it continues to put the human front-and-centre in the essay. My favourites of the year leaned into the idiosyncrasies of human thought. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) It is a truth universally acknowledged that every institution of higher ed in 2025 must be in want of an AI policy. Geist, an educator, has clearly been in dozens of mandatory meetings about this. But he’s interested in something beyond the policy level: Here, he talks to (and about) students in the language of students. The entire essay is a recording of a screen where new popups and windows push and overlap, talking to each other and singing over each other; harmonising into an impassioned defence of recombinant writing. But that remixing, he shows us, is most interesting when it’s deliberate and from the heart. Every meme, reference, and literary allusion he uses has a point. Throughout, he is also talking to ChatGPT. Can Gen-AI have a point? When? When not? Equal parts sincere, thoughtful, and inspiring, Geist’s video is a masterclass in play as pedagogy. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis Lindsay Ellis’s latest – which appropriately doubles as a fundraiser for the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund – is the most cohesive multi-hour video essay epic I’ve seen. She uses the story of children’s YouTuber and educator Ms. Rachel as a starting point: to discuss history, religion, geopolitics, film and entertainment, language, and the current US administration’s ‘war on empathy’. What do we do in the face of all that? What do we do in the face of death tolls measured in almost-incomprehensible numbers? Ellis has always been a forerunner in the space, but what is so exceptional about the piece is that she never loses sight of what Ms. Rachel (and other prominent children’s entertainment pioneers throughout history) represent in this context. Social and emotional learning begins at home, after all. What lessons have we taken away? What do we impart to our kids? Fantasies of Nuremberg by Jacob Geller What happens when we reduce an entire history – conflicts, controversies, contradictions, context – into a singular historical ‘event?’ This is where Jacob Geller begins with his research on the Nuremberg trials. What follows is one of his most comprehensive, well-written, and well-researched essays to date. But hanging over that research, and over his litany of primary sources, is a deep vulnerability. Geller demonstrates – both through his writing and through some visceral editing choices – that it is tempting to fantasise about justice and consequence. He wrestles with that temptation as he speaks. He tempts us too. But in our present moment, do those fantasies mean anything? The answer he lands on is not surprising. But it is necessary, and framed with the gravitas and call to further introspection that Geller always inspires. Bluey Is Perfect, And That Terrifies Me by MML’s Commentaries Prior to watching this, I had a passing understanding of the cultural phenomenon that is Bluey. I knew some younger relatives who watched it, I knew I had friends in their 30s who were (for whatever reason) mesmerised by it, and I knew my spouse – a developmental psychologist – really appreciated what it was doing in the children’s entertainment space. I watched this over a long evening with her. MML’s Commentaries illuminated many of the ‘whys’ for me. But I didn’t just learn about the creative choices that make up Bluey or why it has such a refreshing level of trust in the kids who tune in. I saw, with fresh eyes, how kids’ media looks differently to us in our 30s and up. I saw the anxieties that can arise from that. I saw MML’s Commentaries put a refreshing level of trust into us, as viewers, too. Etched into this video is a family saga, a love story, and a heartfelt dialogue between the real and the imagined. Solarpunk: When Your Ideology Is Pictures by Sam Kern (Afterthoughts) I first encountered Sam Kern’s work through videos on gaming UX / UI. More recently, she’s been working on the Change-Makers series on activism and organising. All in all, there are few essayists better equipped to analyse the various rifts between aesthetics and practice. The solarpunk movement – or rather, aesthetic – seems ripe for exactly that analysis. Kern picks out and examines an astonishing repository of solarpunk illustrations, videos, and (arguably) photographs. These images look good; idyllic even. But do they sound good? Are they saying enough to ‘sound’ at all? It would be easy to critique the genre and land on a conclusion that gives way to doomerism, but that’s not what Kern does here. Her video is a new solarpunk: one that doesn’t just imagine a brighter future, but is honest about what it’ll take to get there. The Space Truck Sim Where You’re Doomed to Fail by LambHoot There is a moment in LambHoot’s video that made me feel physically ill – and it’s not just because the subject matter is Star Trucker, a truck simulator in space (a video game premise that sounds like my personal hell). It’s because LambHoot describes his gameplay experience in such sharp, vivid terms. The world of Star Trucker is a capitalist hell where every minute you do not spend working – even if it’s to take care of your own wellbeing – is a minute wasted. There is a price tag on everything. There is a price tag on air. As with any other LambHoot piece, this is of course not just about Star Trucker. It is about how we synonymise self-worth with work. It is about the anxiety of opportunity cost. It is about the economy of how we spend our free time – and who gets to enjoy free time with dignity. Professor of Film, Television & Digital Media and Design Media Arts at UCLA As a creator and scholar who has been teaching and advocating for evolved modes of scholarly expression for many years, I embrace a broader range of videographic and multimodal scholarship than is reflected in the nominations included here. However, each of the works I have selected shares a reflective relationship to its chosen medium, often including formal experimentation but always making explicit and distinctive use of affordances that are specific to the videographic medium. Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore: Territorial Profiles of Visual Effects (VFX) Workforces in the Global Media Industries by Suryansu Guha Richly illustrated and densely narrated, this video is based on deep, original field research that makes a convincing argument in opposition to conventional wisdom about the (lack of) ‘creativity’ associated with visual effects that are commonly outsourced to the Global South. Mapping Roma by Jessica Wax-Edwards A sometimes playful and often idiosyncratic exploration of space and memory using marketing materials from Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma (2018), overlaying footage from the film with vernacular video captured by the creator, revisiting and reflecting on the construction of memory spaces both within and outside the diegesis of Cuarón’s film. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Experimental use of videographic effects interwoven with text-based analysis that re-envisions cinematic landscapes and aerial scenery; a highly effective use of videographic affordances for engaging the concept of queering cinematic form. The Chemistry of Character in Breaking Bad by Jason Mittell A first-of-its-kind videographic book that offers a groundbreaking intervention in the field of videographic criticism, demonstrating the author’s virtuosic range of critical styles, modes and voices in conjunction with incisive commentary analysing the complexity of long-form, serial character development on an iconic TV series. Media scholar, video essayist, and archivist (Queen Mary University of London & Národní filmový archiv) The Holes We Left Behind by Jacob Smith This video essay, published in the archive-oriented dossier of Movie (edited by John Gibbs), is exemplary in its revelation of intricate economic and environmental issues within a single film. Its focal point is Breaking Away (1979), a coming-of-age movie set in Indianapolis that, in the part where I come from, is almost unknown. Combining scenes from the film with archival footage and a skillful argumentative voice-over, Smith reframes the movie through the lens of real-life workers in the limestone industry. The film’s rumination on generational conflict and shifting economic realities is minimalistically yet powerfully confronted with the archive effect of slowly disappearing historical images and the deep time of geology. Bomba Bernal by Khavn de la Cruz Thanks to César Ustarroz from Found Footage Magazine, I finally saw a film by this extravagant genius of Filipino avant-garde cinema. Bomba Bernal is a sarcastic, often uncompromising look at the bomba genre – a wave of lowbrow Filipino erotic films that experienced its heyday from the late 1960s to the 1980s – yet at the same time it summons its ghosts to reveal, in its deteriorating hints of a potential social liberation, a distinctive charm. Rarely is this ambivalence expressed so cleverly and amusingly, owing to inspiration from Filipino film critic Ishmael Bernal as well as collage-like editing and sound design based on cheap-sounding local appropriations of popular music mainstays. Move on Down: Precarity in Contemporary Hungarian Cinema by László Strausz It is a real shame that there are still so few video essays about East-Central European cinema, especially about contemporary work. That is why I was so pleased that this remarkably detailed and well-researched 20-minute piece was published in Iluminace. Strausz’s work foregrounds the depiction of precarity in Hungarian cinema after the fall of the Communist regime, which triggered tectonic social transformations and widespread instability. Narrated and formally structured in a deliberately non-flamboyant manner, it very effectively argues for the role of class in shaping patterns of representation. It also offers thought-provoking reflections on embodied and accented modes of scholarship. Crochet is Sick! by Alison Peirse Even though I have recently preferred ambitious, sprawling video essays, that doesn’t mean I underestimate the value of simplicity done right. Peirse’s rhythmic, briskly cut video on the ambiguous function of crochets in horror movies neatly wraps up everything it wants to say in under four minutes, testifying to the ability to express central genre tensions through such a simple, workaday object: a source of comfort becoming a source of dread. For what is essentially a supercut, the essay includes self-reflexive moments that not only situate Peirse’s fascination but also, in a particularly infectious way, invite us to share the world of horror crochets with her. Baby It’s You (Lucy Dacus Edit) by Ian Garwood Much like Jacob Smith’s video essay mentioned earlier, Garwood’s work was an invitation for me to watch a forgotten film I hadn’t known – and again it was a coming-of-age story. Baby It’s You (1983) may resemble the 1950s-nostalgia films typical of its era, yet it is also suffused with sadness and unresolved class conflict. Garwood explores this mixture paradoxically by retelling the film – especially the arc of its lead female character – through the sensibility of vidding and fan-made music videos. Although I have never been drawn to Lucy Dacus’s music, within this jukebox-like collage everything suddenly made sense. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Despite finding myself in the position of co-coordinating this poll with the essay’s author, I didn’t want to lose the opportunity to mention Lee’s long-awaited feature-length desktop documentary. Having engaged with this mode of video essay–making both theoretically and practically for quite a few years, I was still struck by how meticulously Lee weaves together the multifarious images of unspeakable violence we encounter in the online world and beyond. The documentary reminds us that the desktop experience isn’t just about wonder and gratification but, nowadays perhaps more often, about fatigue, numbness, even horror. Best viewed in tandem with Neta Alexander’s newest book Interface Frictions. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant Also published in the archival dossier of Movie, Bell and Grant’s work on the not-always-visible art of script supervising reminded me of the value of rewatching video essays in different contexts. Clocking in at almost 33 minutes, I initially found it difficult to watch because of its repetitive style. Yet after seeing it on a big screen (twice!), I got it. It takes a deliberate mode of attention to let the almost parametric multi-screen structure sink in and to appreciate the storytelling of script supervisor Penny Eyles. The video is highly recommended for anyone interested in how oral history can be translated into a videographic form. Video maker and media scholar at Tel Aviv University In alphabetical order: 100 Years of History in 100 Films by kaptainkristian A skillfully-edited journey across a hundred years of history – both real and fictional – through the eyes of cinema. Images of the past, depicted mostly by later films, eventually give way to futuristic visions of the present as imagined by the cinema of the past. It does not end well. F. W. Murnau’s ‘Sunrise’: A Mystic Writing Pad by Cristina Álvarez López Incredible. Insightful. Inspired. I couldn’t do it justice by describing what it does in words. Just watch it. And read Cristina’s own words. I Can Hear Someone Coming by Alison Peirse Published as part of Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, edited by Dayna McLeod for Monstrum, this video offers a hilariously subversive take on the queer potentialities of 1930s horror. Fabulous. Miradas by Pablo Serrano Torres Produced for the 2023 Embodying the Video Essay workshop at Bowdoin College and later published at [in]Transition, this is a playful, touching, and beautifully vulnerable reflection on queerness, identity, embodiment, and collaboration. Call me a sucker for any video essay that features footage of video essayists doing karaoke. Panorama of Western State Penitentiary by Eli Boonin-Vail And I’m equally a sucker for any video essay that opens with dictionary definitions. Drawing on footage from a diverse range of sources – archival and contemporary, documentary and fiction, found and original – this video reflects on and problematises our voyeuristic fascination with prisons as sites of surveillance, spectacle, and tourism. Sebastián Leilo’s Two Glorias – Aging in Translation by Barbara Zecchi A comparative analysis of a Chilean film and its English-language remake, this highly affective piece makes brilliant use of the multiscreen format to explore issues of age, gender, and transcultural adaptation. Terrific. The Disturbing Current: Three-Shots in The Awful Truth by Joel Blackledge A wonderful examination of how staging, blocking, and framing are used to great dramatic and comedic effect in Leo McCarey’s The Awful Truth. The video employs an ideally suited, frustratingly simple formal device of the ‘I wish I’d thought of that!’ variety. Spot on. Video essayist, editor, and semiotician; Intermediality MSc student at the University of Edinburgh Grand Theft Auto Is Killing Everything by chriswaves A meta take on the talking-head style of video essays and commentary videos, chriswaves applies a frenetic analysis with hyper-intentional editing. Clips are sequenced and overlayed in a way that supplement and supersede the spoken points he makes about the meaning of mediums and the state of the creator economy in the middle of this decade. HOT TO GO! by Cǎlin Husar There is no shortage of studies queering David Lynch’s body of work, and Cǎlin Husar’s analysis of Eraserhead is solid. Husar contrasts Lynch’s debut with one of the most iconic, joyous queer anthems of recent memory to elucidate Eraserhead’s themes of heteronormative pressures to perform, parent, plus resultant anxiety. “Interpretation” (or “Me (or, “Me (or, Me”)”)”) by JerryTerry The final boss of meta-interpretation, this video is a rat king of essays in 2025. It starts out (as an introspection of) analysing video game Signalis and its fan discourse, exploring the notion of generative interpretation as its own artistic expression. Kaleidoscopically tumbling outward into meta-layers of meta-layers, it can get a bit hard to parse, but is ultimately a meditation on creating online, interpreting online, the self-observation that comes in both activities, and their interweaving. red dead redemption 2 is still a vibe by orangewall An anthology of three mini-essays about videogame aesthetics and the sequel to rockstar’s epic western. orangewall’s own visual style is striking, directly filming old monitors displaying relevant gameplay and video sources to create comforting, retro feel. It continues into the writing, too, with a general similarity to mainstream video essays of the late 2010s, just sharper. There Are No More Normal Guys by Jack Saint Ah, the infamous t-word. or x-word. That site everyone used to use. Jack Saint observes, from afar, a viral spat over misunderstandings of masculine norms, before an extrapolation. Normal guys no longer become normal online: if they aren’t subject to outrage, they’re deified. Jack overlays news coverage in audio and video forms deftly, in between spoken commentary. His synthesis of modes examine these two extremes with case studies in respect to minor online spectacles and major news events. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) A fantastic screen-trawling odyssey across the perforations of AI across contemporary culture. josh (with parentheses) uniquely compares and contrasts video and audio sources within the diegetic space of a mac desktop. It’s reminiscent of Occitane Lacurie’s doc from last year’s poll, xena’s body (a menstrual auto-investigation using an iPhone). What is the state of writing, and writing online, now? Especially in a time of post-plagiarism super-awareness, of large-language model dupes, and dupes of dupes, of concern, of hyperreality. Josh answers the call. Media scholar, bricoleur It was a very difficult year and it seems that my picks seem to reflect some of the pain and loss it held. Once again, I become aware of how video essays for me are not just a way to think, but a way to exist. These video essays and the people who made them (and so many more I couldn’t mention here) make me want to go on. Sticky by Maria Hofmann What does it mean to witness? How do we watch the unwatchable? The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly The apocalypse is coming to a screen near you. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell A scholar is analysing a series by playing a scholar who analyses a series and makes a video essay series about it. Mise-en-abyme is Jason Mittell’s middle name. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod Once again, Dayna is hitting you like a splash of cold water. Right in the face of a consumer society so obsessed with policing the aging female body. I am wide awake again. Look at Me by Alison Peirse These piercing gazes. They hit me in the blink of an eye. Caught in the Dream of the Other by Cristina Álvarez López & Adrian Martin The mirror is a trap. And a portal. You won’t come out of it unchanged. Line Drawings by Joseph Popper The dotted line – a fragile, fractured umbilical cord connecting us to the outer space. There is something strangely relieving in knowing how easily we can become untethered. Curator of Film and Video for e-flux Narrative by Anocha Suwichakornpong The self-reflective work reveals how political trauma moves like a spirit through people’s lives, unsettling what one sees, hears, and remembers, and how film can become a tool for seeking justice and healing. You Won’t Feel a Thing by Hiwa K. Emotionally impactful film calls into question the marginalization of Indigenous forms of knowledge and healthcare by the corporate interests of Western medicine through the masterful use of film essay style. Slet 1988 by Marta Popivoda A masterful combination of the archival footage and documentary to reflect on the specters of history. Experimental / Essay Filmmaker, Poet, Exceptional Man / Average Pisces I am attracted to poetic video essays; non-traditional, humorous, experimental videographic works. My choices tend to bend the definition of what a video essay is… but I believe in the inclusive nature of the form. So, here goes: Frontier by Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco An elegant meditation on the culture of cowboys and cinema, with a hand-lettered feel. Transformed clips of relevant movies enrich the understanding of the author’s thesis. The whole video has a slowness about it and a lulling sound design that I found refreshing. Paul Schrader on The Florida Project by James Whale Bake Sale Wise old sage Paul Schrader appraises the anecdotal nature of Sean Baker’s film in a nicely cut together videographic piece by stalwart YouTuber James Whale Bake Sale. As a Floridian myself, I appreciated the embodied representation of colours that define my state and a revisit to a film I saw before I ever found myself living there. The Thinking Machine #94: Shot Missing by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin This is the most ‘Los Angeles’ video essay this side of Thom Andersen. I have been an admirer of the trope where you juxtapose two similar films in one videographic work. I’ve done it in my own art practice and I admire how it was done here. I had never heard of the film by Abel Ferrara, but sure enough it deserves a comparison to Lynch’s Lost Highway. Clever associations abound, but there is also a sustained and unified mood that makes the two films seem as one; surely the ultimate purpose behind such an exploration. Writer; overseeing the research and documentation at the Centre Pompidou film collection Three encounters in three different contexts: a cinema; an exhibition; my phone. Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat by Johan Grimonprez A reused footage fresco on the geopolitical (and musical) context that led to the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in 1961. This montage of archival material is devoid of accompanying voiceover, instead its textual elements are either to be read on screen (provided with bibliographical footnotes) or heard as direct quotations read aloud on the soundtrack. Distributed theatrically in France in the fall of 2025, I was able to watch it on a monumental-sized screen. The magnifying effect on many of the low-resolution transfers is one of the work’s compelling aspects. Mais perto de você [Closer to You] by Isadora Soares Belletti Saw it as an installation in the collective exhibition L’art et la vie et inversement at Beaux-Arts de Paris in March 2025. The young Brazilian artist, based in France, made this video portrait of her watching the sunset in Belo Horizonte, her hometown in Brasil, next to her grandmother, Teresinha Soares. Journal or essay? It is an attempt to record a casual moment – a fleeting conversation, ordering take-out food – with a studied insistence on the first-person account (via the hand-held camera capturing the sun from the balcony). Secret des stars: Bella Hadid by Dr Chloé Mathez-Loïc Chloé Mathez-Loïc appeared in my Instagram feed with one reel about the surgical secrets behind Bella Hadid’s face. This one video was posted on her account, in collaboration with Forever Institut (apparently the first centre of cosmetic medicine in Switzerland), and openly inscribed itself in the vein of the ‘Secret de stars’ content, popular on TikTok. It appears she published only three reels so far: a similar one on Kylie Jenner, and an interview in which she answers some questions about her work and personal hobbies. The format is canonical in its kind: Dr Mathez-Loïc looks at a photo on her phone and comments on surgical techniques used to achieve certain effects on the given public persona, while the viewer sees a picture in the foreground. The content is informative, but it is her calmness, off-pace in the realm of reels, as if oblivious of its destination, and a bordering-humour detachment, that makes her reel more intriguing than the ones by her online peers. Webby Award-winning video essayist, writer, and producer I’ve been making video essays for over 14 years. Work-Life Balance • A Podcastèsque Video Essay by Melis Altınso and Ceyda Ece Akköse This is what the sociology of cinema should aim at; challenging the everyday norms with curiosity and acidic wit. Nebulous Encounters by Catherine Grant Anytime a creator can effectively juxtapose two moving images to the point where it captivates me, it is a success. Grant understands how our eyes and hearts talk to the screen. The Pulse by Catherine Salnikova If These Walls Could Talk: The Shining Video Essay Clipse — Let God Sort Em Out (Official Album Trailer) by Clipse Clipse have possibly made the best music album of 2025, and in their promotion leading up to its release, have given the world the year’s best video mashup. Professor of Cinema Studies, Savannah College of Art and Design My video essay viewing this year has been shaped by my preparation for teaching a course on the subject. I’ve been drawn to videos that exemplify successful audiovisual applications of cinema studies methods and arguments, and I think these three will provide great examples and fodder for discussion. The Hand That Touches the Arm by Calac Nogueira This video assembles an impressive number and variety of film clips that convey a very specific gesture – the assistive touch (usually by a man) of another person (usually a woman) on the arm or elbow. This common action is wonderfully defamiliarised via the supercut, revealing a hidden lexicon that is open to interpretation. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková This video essay is both delightful and substantive. It manages to offer a history and theory of the star wipe as a cultural artefact (you never knew you needed this, but you do!), exploring and embodying the star wipe’s playful impudence that resonates well beyond nostalgia. This video essay beautifully exemplifies the audiovisual and essayistic potentials of a media archaeology methodology. The Water Diaries, or My Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi Chiara Grizzaffi’s decision to frame this video as a letter to Jane [Campion] is an inspired appropriation, resulting in a work that is both playful and sincere. Her voice-over is so engaging – rich in essayistic potential as it weaves together personal narrative with pressing questions about the larger world, anchored in the possibilities of feminist theory. I would love to see a version of this video that actually uses footage from Campion’s films, but I realise that wasn’t within the constraints of the assignment. Curator, writer Zifzafa by Lawrence Abu Hamdan At once imaginative, beautiful, and incensed. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory The essay form as dissolved into narrative. Partition by Diana Allan Smart, righteous, and lucid work. Creator of Be Kind Rewind, a YouTube channel that explores film history. A Man Like My Aunt: Community and Desire in Working Girls by Kallan Benjamin Benjamin thoroughly analyses the opening sequences of Dorothy Arzner’s Working Girls to explore how a working class women’s boarding house functions as a communal space that exists outside of patriarchy, heterosexuality, and the workplace. It’s a true pleasure to see Arzner’s work receive such detailed attention. Technology Isn’t Fun Anymore by Drew Gooden In this video, Drew Gooden articulates the casual frustrations foisted upon consumers by endless mergers, acquisitions, and content wars waged by major corporations. Seemingly no one, he points out, seeks to materially improve the collective user experience. Why can’t you watch your local basketball team on television? Why does an app that turns lights on and off have a social media component? Everything is a nightmare; at least Gooden can help us laugh about it. HELLO? by Alison Peirse Landline phones play a significant role in slasher films. Women answer in fear, hang up in haste, and shudder in anticipation of violence. Peirse imagines alternative (better) futures for these characters. Solidarity finds the final girls. Researcher in film and philosophy. Member of the film exhibition and programming collective Salón de Cines Múltiples (SACIMU) in Oaxaca, Mexico Piel de toro muerto by Aroldo Murguia It’s fitting to begin with a bold statement about the origin and nature of cinema, emerging from the South. In an overpowering mixture of Super 8 footage and digital photogrammetry, flickers and rotations, as well as cyanotypes, rotoscoping, and frottage, Peruvian filmmaker and programmer Aroldo Murguia declares the ancient Toro Muerto petroglyphs in the Arequipa region of Peru, marked by continuous sequences of animals in movement, to be the site where cinema was invented thousands of years ago. The claim rests somewhat less on the petroglyphs’ age in comparison with European sites that have invited similar speculations (such as the Copper Age rock carvings at Valcamonica with which Jonathan Walley begins his book Cinema Expanded) than on the tangible passage of time constituting Murguia’s audiovisual argument: incarnating, rather than simply hypothesising, the place of cinema’s invention. This is an argument backed by a firm command of metaphors – “El cine es una serpiente que constantemente cambia de piel” (“Cinema is a snake that constantly sheds its skin”), he says in an opening title – and Murguia is indeed demonstrating a protocinema (an ‘ancestor’ of cinema, in Juan Camilo Martínez’s description) apt to be recognised as such under present mutations in the digital age. Accompanying the film’s premiere this year in the ‘Umbrales’ experimental section of the FICUNAM festival in Mexico City was a brilliant catalogue statement by Murguia locating the matter of cinema, and not just its idea, in early 20th-century ‘sololoy’ (celluloid) dolls in Mexico, thus placing Piel de toro muerto, for all that it sensorily inherits from the wider cosmos, at the level of fragile toys – as he says, in a cinema of “sololoy”. Mahmoud Darwish: In the Presence of Absence by Maryam Tafakory “Time was less defiant than now”, reads Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in his 2005 poem ‘Tabāq’ (‘Antithesis’), memorialising Edward Said and recalling their first meeting in New York 30 years earlier. Tafakory’s uncanny work conjoins a video from that same year of Darwish reading ‘Antithesis’ in Ramallah – a recording that continues its errant passage around the internet (as of this writing it appears to have been removed from YouTube) – with a letter from Mohamad Golabi explaining the unguent that the same poem provided him while recovering in a hospital in New York. I saw this work in another Western capital, Lisbon, in the excellent two-part film programme curated by Cristina Hadwa and Raquel Schefer, Trojan Cinema: Spectral Archives of Palestine, which foregrounded Darwish’s self-definition as a ‘Trojan poet’, in search of the voices of the defeated (in ‘Antithesis’ identified with Said: “the last epic hero / defending the right of Troy / to share the narrative”). Video essay conventions of blackness surrounding a split screen offer something like the enveloping comfort that Golabi ascribes to Darwish’s words, which for him helped to render the impossible less ‘distant’. The poem’s title of ‘Antithesis’ then covers not only the split screen, or the epistolary connection between Golabi and Tafakory, or the friendship between Darwish and Said, but also Darwish’s expression of the vanities of pleading for an oppressor’s understanding, even under fantasies of parity: “Had my sword / been larger than my rose, would you / have asked if I would have acted like you?” The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The gentle, welcoming touches of this sparkling, deeply researched video only serve to accentuate its central philosophical question, one few would have thought to ask: What kind of artefact, if any, is the star wipe? Indeed, what kinds of objects are editing transitions, and how do they feature in our memory? These questions turn out to depend on classical aesthetic debates about theatricality, ostentation, and taste – permeating the video’s unironic embrace of corn and personal address – as well as the commodity status of the gimmick (as formulated by Sianne Ngai). But then, what does it mean for an editing device to symbolise doing too little (and thus ostentatiously revealing a readiness to do anything at all) to please another? Did we always know that there was such pathos in the star wipe? The question more directly addressed in this video is what would it be to touch the star wipe, something that Anger and Hanáková undertake in a didactic method of printing, cutting, and touching also used in another important video from this year, A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds. They thus in effect raise the question of how to locate the star wipe’s seemingly perfect geometry among the ‘weird shapes’ in early Czech archival footage analysed in the latter and in Anger’s book Towards a Film Theory from Below. Anger and Hanáková say that the star wipe points to paradoxes of simultaneous bewitchment and disenchantment, though in taking another look at one of their examples – George Kuchar’s Secrets of the Shadow World (1999) – and hearing Kuchar’s friend Andy Martinez sincerely describe his encounters with fairies in the mountains of Taos, New Mexico, I find myself inspired by the video to prefer to think that a world, whether diegetic or extra-diegetic, that makes space for star wipes is a significantly re-enchanted one. The Holes We Left Behind by Jacob Smith While The Return of the Star Wipe is an archaeology of media ephemerality, The Holes We Left Behind is an assertion of permanence. Together with Piel de Toro Muerto, this video is a landmark of petrocinematic criticism. Making a beautiful case for how the Hollywood coming-of-age film Breaking Away (Peter Yates, 1979) is an archive of Indiana limestone, Smith draws on eye-opening material from Bloomington Community Access Television (BCAT) and the Indiana Limestone Company. This most importantly features an interview with Harold Dugan Elgar, the real-life master stone carver who briefly appears in the original film as a former colleague of the protagonist’s father, played by Paul Dooley, who has gone from cutting stone to selling used cars (from one petro-economy to another, as Smith says). In an especially affecting moment, a cropped shot from the film of Dooley’s hand touching limestone on the Indiana University campus gives way to archival audio from BCAT narrating the formation of Indiana Limestone in the Mississippian period. Without Smith making this explicit, there is something familiar here: it might be the petro equivalent of the ‘man existing alone’ observatory speech in that other coming-of-age film invoking a planetary timescale, Rebel Without a Cause. This is an essay that – including in its use of, in its author’s words, ‘fragile’ archival video from community access TV – absolutely transmits weight. Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore: Territorial Profiles of Visual Effects (VFX) Workforces in the Global Media Industries by Suryansu Guha This vital and richly documented essay busts persistent myths about the geopolitics of labor in the visual effects (VFX) industry, drawing on interviews with workers in studios in India. Guha demonstrates that the proliferation of VFX in Hollywood blockbusters in the last two decades is not just the result of technology, but also of the emergence of a racialised global infrastructure, where offshore VFX studios supply a ‘standing reserve’ of labour to the Global North. But while the division of labor captured in the video’s title (Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore) is real, Guha argues that the myth underlying it, of matchmove and other outsourced VFX work as uncreative ‘lower-level’, ‘grunt work’ is manifestly not: precarity and racialization also mask where and among whom a great deal of the creative VFX work in fact takes place. A remarkable example of obfuscation of labor elaborated on by Guha is how the false marketing of Oppenheimer (2023) as free of CGI necessitated a sparse – and, in the end, racialised – list of end credits of only 77 VFX workers. We learn that when the British-Indian VFX studio released its own, much longer, supplementary credits for Oppenheimer, 90% named were Indian. I would like to see this research widened in order to account for the longer history of outsourcing in Hollywood, including ‘runaway’ animation and maquila animation practices in Latin America, beginning in the late 1950s. As Juan Manuel Aurrecoechea explains in his history of Mexican animation, El episodio perdido, when Rocky and Bullwinkle first aired, its principal animators in Mexico City were appalled to see their names absent from the credits, taken up only by Anglo ones. Prophets and Propaganda, or, If Faces Tire You, What Will Movies Do? by Stephen Broomer This intriguingly measured study of Ron Ormond’s 1970s Evangelical sermon films featuring Baptist preacher Estus Pirkle goes far beyond indulging in the films’ camp and anti-communist hysterics, and instead focuses on the functioning of Ormond’s closeups on Pirkle’s face. Drawing on Slavko Vorkapich’s poetics and the idea that the closeup “could disrupt the uncanny of the photoplay to serve a greater truth”, Broomer argues that Ormond uses these closeups on the preacher to “much the same end” as Vorkapich: distancing cinema from theatre. Ormond thus renders film and sermon as one, to amplifying effect: according to Broomer, repetition of the patriarch’s face becomes an effective (not just camp) vehicle of brainwashing. Viewing Prophets and Propaganda in light of The Return of the Star Wipe, I am led to ask: Is there something gimmicky about the closeup of the face that august theorising about it since the early 20th century has obscured – or perhaps sublimated? Have we learned to ignore the gimmickry of the closeup? The present-day heirs of Ormond and Pirkle in the US teach us that gimmickry and brainwashing are hardly antithetical. Digital curator, Fotomuseum Winterthur I have selected works from the field of media arts and digital cultures that connect with the genre of video essay yet experiment with its form through networked and digital properties, or where the video essay is part of a larger project – extending installations and performances usually hosted in art galleries and museums. I am interested in how the format of the video essay can extend its technical definitions and extend to a larger way of thinking, embedded in artistic projects which would not normally enter the circulation networks of video essays. A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek A Life of Its Own is a series of experimental web-based works, large-scale wallpapers and installations by Sara Bezovšek, exploring how popular movies transform online into memes, GIFs and remixes. Focusing on culturally significant films like The Matrix, American Psycho and The Lord of the Rings, Bezovšek tracks how scenes are transformed into memetic fragments that gain a life of their own as they leave their source context and circulate online. Driven by free creative labour and network dynamics, images not only take on new meanings, but are easily repurposed for various social and political agendas. While memes from American Psycho equally critique and celebrate toxic masculinity, The Lord of the Rings is appropriated to support both right-wing and left-wing ideologies, for example. By organising the material collected from social media platforms and obscure online forums according to the films’ original plot, Bezovšek accentuates the spread of memetic content and its ability to seamlessly blend entertainment, ideologies and politics. Image Syncers by Nina Davies Nina Davies uses speculative fiction to examine the consequences of today’s ‘perception collapse’, taking as a starting point TikTok trends in which people mimic AI-generated videos. Her project Image Syncers imagines futures where AI-driven choreographies disrupt visual economies, generate alternative modes of meaning, and gesture toward communication with emerging algorithmic dimensions. The central video blends the narrative strategies of podcasts and video essays with imagery that merges AI-generated footage and performances choreographed by the artist. The world of Image Syncers extends across installations, photographic works, and live performances, forming a coherent universe in which language, images, and bodies evolve under the pervasive influence of synthetic media. Anatomy of a Non-Fact, Chapter 2: Tick Tick Tick… Boom by Martyna Marciniak Anatomy of Non-Fact is an artistic research project investigating how misinformation and information overload take shape in an era increasingly defined by post-optical imagery. The project spans different chapters and media, including a full recreation of the puffy coat generated in the now iconic AI image of the so-called ‘Balenciaga Pope’. In 2025, the second chapter of Anatomy of a Non-Fact continues the investigation started the year before, extending the study of the image of the pope to other symbols of broader visual cultures and economies. Anatomy of Non-Fact, Chapter 2: Tick Tick Tick… Boom sketches out possible futures for how visual truth might be constructed, and the effects of virality on political violence, and market instability. The video moves from a traditional essayistic form to a promotional narrative, introducing a system to generate effective ‘panic images’ to conveniently manipulate the market. Combining a critical reflection with a parodic advertisement, the project builds another layer on top of the world of manipulated images that the artist simultaneously constructs and critiques. Critic & researcher Agencia by May Santiago A deeply personal essay film that charts a new way forward for videographic criticism as it relates to not only activating the archive but working towards building new ones. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková A ground-breaking work that showcases the video essay’s potential for media archaeology, and one that charts a path forward for rediscovering and celebrating ephemera of the moving image. Air Bud Pt. II: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (Web Exclusive) by Last Week Tonight A bit of media analysis from a man and team who understand our time like no other. The World Doesn’t End When You Do by marlow magdalene A remarkable, personal work that expands our sense of what is possible with the archive. Mutineer by Scout Tafoya “By then, I’d seen a lot on TV…” Another astonishing work from a master. Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley by Christian Keathley An epic project, beautifully realised over many years by a scholar without whom much videographic criticism would not be made. Film critic, programmer, researcher, and translator I must confess that I’ve lagged behind a bit, this year, in terms of video essays, so this list is quite clearly open-ended (and should be taken as such). Even so – there are some gems that’ve caught my eye. Here they are: Debut, or, Objects of the Field of Debris as Currently Catalogued by Julian Castronovo Equal parts essay-film and (faux?) video essay, Castronovo’s polemic approach to the form and ingeniousness simply left me in awe upon my first viewing of it. A deeply rich text. happiness by Fırat Yücel What an effective, amazing work about the mediality of the Palestinian genocide, a meditation on what it truly means to witness a live-streamed genocide, amongst other apps and enormous quantities of digital debris – both grave and, at times, incredibly funny in its use of (self-effacing) dark humour. Being John Smith by John Smith Finally caught up with it this year. John Smith is like none other (pun intended?). Slet 1988 by Marta Popivoda Expanding upon her previous work, Popivoda does something quite incredible with the format here: she frames a video essay with auto-fictional insertions that emulate the perspective of a teenaged self. What a beautiful, playful innovation. Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault The perspective of tech-colonialism – of outsourced labor, its gaze/regard, of the human cost that AI is constructed upon, of the new nightmarish ways that the contemporary panopticon keeps on finding to transform moving images into surveillance. Lloyd Wong, unfinished by Lesley Loksi Chan Video creator and visual content designer for YouTube How We’re Redesigning Audacity for the Future by Tantacrul Bit of a controversial choice, as this video is more of an advertisement for software the creator is promoting than a traditional video essay. Still, Tantacrul’s rhythm in editing and storytelling is something other creators can and should learn from. Controversial opinion: Norman Rockwell’s art was more than kitsch. Your thoughts?⁠⁠ by Josie Lewis One of my favourite recent short-form essays. Josie is well-versed in tackling a timely topic; challenging the kitsch nostalgia for a bygone era by revealing Norman Rockwell’s more progressive side. I Played Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 Every Day for a Month. Here’s What Happened by Static Canvas Another experimental video essay, from a creator whose work I’ve grown really fond of the past year. Tom from Static Canvas explores the summertime adventures of Boku no Natsuyasumi by writing diary entries after each play session. I love its approach to roleplaying as a form of analysis. Making Sense of ‘Dad Movies’ by In/Frame/Out I’ve been a fan of In/Frame/Out’s accessible approach to film analysis for years, and this topic is a great entry point for newcomers. It explores ‘Dadcore’ movies; what defines them and what they reveal about the audiences who love them. Delivered, as usual, in IFO’s smart writing and stylish editing. Mario Kart World’s real winner… is graphic design by elliotisacoolguy Elliot’s videos showcase many aspects of his graphic design expertise; how to create visuals across a range of unusual programs, viral design challenges, and, more importantly for this list, essays on what design communicates. In this case, he focuses on this year’s Mario Kart World and its overlooked fictional brands. blue prince is at odds with itself by Video Games Are Bad Don’t let the channel’s branding fool you; Harry’s writing cuts to the heart of what makes games great, blending genuine enthusiasm with a deep knowledge for the medium, while keeping things concise and approachable. His look at this year’s indie cult hit Blue Prince captures what his channel does best: making thoughtful arguments and exploring every interesting thread, all presented with the tone of a friendly chit-chat. How Many Times Can You Pee in Heavy Rain? by Allie Meowy My video essay of the year. Allie Meowy deserves credit for asking the question no one else would – and uncovering some fascinating insights along the way. Audiovisual essayist and Professor of Film Studies at the University of St Andrews Looking at my choices, I see that I have particularly valued work thinking through and about history, whether that is presenting marginalised histories through stories of digitisation or labour, or re-imagining personal histories and relationships to media, or speculative/revisionist approaches. Many of these pieces have made me consider the project of historical work in different ways, offering inspiration for how we might approach an archive, an institution, a role, a genre. On the formal side, I’ve chosen work that has impressed me in its audiovisual choices, and in particular, videos that have demonstrated how affective videographic form can be. All of these pieces have moved or entranced me, some have blown my mind with their skill, elegance and distinctiveness. (It turns out, multiscreens really speak to me!) As always there are simply too many pieces to choose from, so I’ve given some further recommendations in my comments. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková and Jiří Žák Compositionally and analytically rich, A Tale of Two Desktops offers an insight into early cinema which brings novel ways of thinking about how to address aesthetic specificity, especially aesthetic qualities that might be overlooked as mistakes or limitations of technology. This work does a great deal to expand and spatialise videographic approaches to the archive, as does John Gibbs’ highly enjoyable Backlot Connections. Post-Cinema: The Hall of Mirrors by Joel Blackledge I saw Post-Cinema: The Hall of Mirrors at the Marienbad Film Festival in June, and was really swept away by the power of its central formal conceit – a moving reel of images – which delivers and builds on engagement with theory. Though very different in pace and tone, the powerful force of the compositional choice reminded me of Catherine Grant’s use of a reel of images in Making Fiction Flow (in collaboration with Melanie Bell), which presents a masterful form for engaging with archival materials (in this case oral histories). See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird Striking, insightful, playful and incisive. This is at once dazzling and sharp, combining the intense sensory pleasures of the audiovisual essay with its capacity for critical insight. As with work I most admire, it makes me see, think and feel new things every time I watch. The Hand That Touches the Arm by Calac Nogueira Palpably demonstrating the power of accumulation, this piece illuminates the critical force of selection and editing. Quietly troubling, the audience’s attention is demanded. While Nogueira gradually calls our attention to look and feel for small gestures, Barbara Zecchi commands our attention to violence against women, making her own declarative and interventionist gestures in Overturning Carmen’s feminicide: Materialising women’s agency through the musical. Meet Part | Mothers Daughters by Viktoria Paranyuk Illusive and suggestive, while being somehow dense and stark simultaneously, Paranyuk’s compositional approach repays multiple viewings. Although the piece as a whole is formally very different, the tactility and care of the editing reminds me of Johannes Binotto’s work, especially his gestures of thought – inscription, which was my favourite this year. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shepard’s work is beautifully poised; compelling formal decisions are married with stirring personal reflection. The quality of the personal with such arresting image-making connects to Dayna McLeod’s Pot Belly, a much cheekier work, which brings with it no less force for thinking through the specificity of the maker’s relationship to a particular film. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar Sundar’s audiovisual essay stages an encounter between a scene and film history, carried through sound but masterfully conceptualised through layering and text. The power of sound, and capacity to communicate narrative and affective experience through remixing of images achieved so brilliantly here is carried further by Alison Peirse’s HELLO?, in which new generic possibilities are built. Film lecturer and researcher at Liverpool John Moores University These video essays all lingered well beyond the brief period I spent watching them. Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement by Amanda Doxtater “It was devastating and beautiful at once” which appears in this video essay and eloquently sums up how I feel about it. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod The unlikely yet pitch perfect meeting of video essayist and waterfall. A reminder that form and method may not be found at my desk in front of my computer. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The absolute joy of this piece belies the clarity of its argument and the amount of research which has gone into it. And I am definitely staying tuned for the ‘Home Improvement’ instalment in the series. ON BEING ’WITH’ NORMAL PEOPLE by Catherine Fowler This video essay plays so beautifully with the tension of proximity, of closeness, of being ‘with’, and then of course of being without. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar Fascinating to listen to (and watch) and consider the mediating nature of the listening experience; listening on listening on listening, and indeed listening to listening to listening. Associate Professor, Queens College/CUNY and co-editor of [in]Transition The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková This is exemplary media archaeology and a reminder of the whimsy of programming decisions. Bride of Frankenstein [film|minutes] — interactive version by Shane Denson Slowness is the antidote to a constructed life; a tool to reorganise the parts. Another Delicious Story by Karin Shankar We make images from images made by others. And sometimes they’re your kids. Giallo by Matt Miller AI bad. Code good. Sharing tools and methods is the way. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell Form runs through the wringer. Freelance film curator, researcher, and cultural worker In assembling this list, I was guided by a principle articulated last year by my esteemed colleague Julian Ross: “Essay films = video essays.” Without denying the heuristic or aesthetic value of online videographic criticism, I chose to focus on a more immersive encounter with essayistic thought – namely, in cinemas and contemporary art spaces. In a world whose condition increasingly resembles a catastrophe, gaining access to such experiences is becoming ever more difficult (at least for me, an unemployed immigrant), and thus all the more precious. Perhaps a reaction to this same world-condition underlies the mixture of melancholy and incisive critical thinking that permeates most of the films I selected. As the literary scholar Mikhail Epstein once wrote, the essay form is marked by “uncertainty and brazenness, the sadness of an exile and the audacity of a wanderer.” Each of the five films follows this fluctuating artistic strategy in its own way, reflecting on the maladies and peculiarities of our time. Each resonates deeply with my current state of mind. Evidence by Lee Anne Schmitt If the essay’s key strength is its critical potential, then questioning contemporary power structures becomes one of its essential tasks. This film embodies that brilliantly: a brilliant, penetrating investigation of American neoconservatism. BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph One of the most spectacular films of 2025, together with an inventive and multifaceted reflection on contemporary Black culture. Family Constellation with a Fox by Gernot Wieland Combining a Benjaminian poetic tone, intellectual clarity, personal mythologies and wonderful ceramic figures, this work struck me as both piercing and uplifting. New Old Homeland by Taniguchi Akihiko One of the year’s best machinima essay films, offering a deep and humorous reflection on the increasingly prominent virtual worlds shaped by game engines. Hostile Landscapes by Zhang Hanwen This is a wonderful example of a slow-paced, dual-channel essay film that subtly enhances the viewer’s sense of agency. I especially appreciate the attunement between my gaze and the filmmaker’s calm exploration of a landscape beneath which lie layers of colonial history and mechanisms of power. Technologist and creator of cinematic essays who teaches coding for media studies at Columbia University and works in Technology at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Many of my nominations emerged from a course I designed and still teach at Columbia University’s School of the Arts. Nearly all of last year’s cohort had no prior knowledge of video essays or even nonlinear editing, yet they produced exceptional work that earned recognition beyond the classroom. Two of them spoke and screened their films at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, and two video essays are forthcoming in an upcoming issue of In Media Res. Their work demonstrates the medium’s capacity to function as scholarship, criticism, and art. Trapped on a Pedestal by Sam Gordon Gordon’s close visual reading of John Cassavetes’ A Woman Under the Influence is simultaneously sublime and evocative. While the ultra-widescreen is a treat for the eyes, its clever sound design shouldn’t be missed: listen with headphones. CAROL (2015): Discontinuity in the Pursuit of Jean Epstein’s Photogénie by Lily Cummings Cummings’ close examination of Todd Haynes’ 2015 film Carol with Epstein’s enigmatic Photogénie blends a cinematic style through an academic lens. Agnes’ Song by Chengkangjie (Eric) Huang How can you portray the difficult subject of ‘comfort women’ in audiovisual form? Huang succeeded in this film that is haunting, yet respectful to the survivors and their stories. Gleaning Reflection by Gracie Hecht Hecht uses both literal and metaphorical mirrors and lenses in her meditation on the reflexive mode of filmmaking employed by Agnès Varda’s The Gleaners and I (2000). Hecht was one of my students who was granted access to Varda’s archives, and invited to accompany the screening of her video essay at the Cannes Film Festival this year. (Untitled) by Committee of Affairs (CoA) The anonymous artist Committee of Affairs (CoA) produces for both TikTok and Instagram. Their reels tend to have a style, which are all acquired content from other sources, mostly other users and films. The clips usually begin with an opening clip of a user speaking directly to us, then a wave of music and moving images, ending with an image of text that often speeds by too quickly to read. The genre is either hopecore or corecore, depending on the video and your mood. This reel feels like corecore as it pierces through layers of the human condition on the rhythm of Radiohead’s Exit Music. What’s also worth further examination is how the same reel is received differently amongst users on different platforms. Effect becomes affect … depending on the audience affected. This work reveals that algorithmically-circulated montage doesn’t have a stable affect. It becomes a different object through the sorting algorithms, comment culture, and the base of users. Instagram users skew towards a phenomenological intensity, while TikTok users articulate melancholia for the same video. By making algorithmic mediation visible through cross-platform distribution, CoA transforms the montage into an analytical argument about how digital infrastructure shapes feeling. Database Gleaning by Andrea De Bedout De Bedout’s moving cinematic video essay is a blend of poetic and desktop documentary modes. We watch her mine The Gleaners and I (2000) dailies database revealing details of the filmmaking process. She shows us connections between the footage, archive, and interface, bringing in Lev Manovich as an interlocutor. Interface icons become moving images, buttons become prompts, themes become filenames. We see the act of gleaning of a gleaner. Like Hecht, De Bedout was invited to speak and screen her film at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. josh (with parentheses) is a video essayist who attempts to make complex, compelling arguments in the stupidest possible ways. He sometimes succeeds at the first part, but is pretty reliable for the second. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord I do not care even a tiny bit about architecture, the focus of Kendra Gaylord’s work, but I will never miss a single one of her videos. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms is a perfect example of why: architecture is, to her, something humans do that can help us understand humans. It is a story about the architectural history of a building, and also the emergence of a meme, and also about how a very generous man gave a lot to the internet and the least we can do is help him fix his roof. Why Milchick’s Story Hurts So Much: Black Survival in White Workplace by Afrodizjha Afrodizjha’s close appreciation of Tramell Tillman’s bravura performance as Mr. Milchick on Severance helped me understand Milchick as illustrative of the ways in which Blackness is controlled and repressed in white-dominated corporate spaces. Being a YouTuber Bankrupted Me by Innuendo Studios The first thing to say about this choice is that Ian Danskin’s work as Innuendo Studios is consistently phenomenal, from top to bottom and without exception. On Nebula, he is currently working on a series of short game reviews that construct a historical framework for the genre; I would find it shocking if others did not include this year’s The South Bank of the Rubicon among their poll responses; and his The Alt-Right Playbook series represents some of the most powerful and instructive analysis of the rhetorical manipulations that have enabled the rise of fascism over the last few decades. When Danskin published this video, he had nearly half a million subscribers and a well-earned reputation as one of the best and most thoughtful essayists on YouTube. He was, by most metrics of the platform, extremely successful. And yet, the title. I choose this essay for two reasons. First, I think Danskin’s experience highlights some of the major systemic problems facing working essayists on YouTube. There are plenty of essayists in similar positions, essayists who are doing remarkable work that is engaging their audience and drawing traffic to YouTube, and who are yet unable to sustain that work financially. Second, because Danskin’s GoFundMe hit *double* its goal within two days. Reading the comments both on the video and on the GFM shows how deeply and how well Danskin is loved and appreciated by his community, and how ready his audience was to step up and support him. It is easy to feel bleak, as a video essayist on YouTube in 2025, about the prospects of making a channel sustainable. This video showcases the difficult truth of that situation. The creators are showing up and doing phenomenal work. The audience is there ready and willing to support those creators. But the systems that creators need to enable their labor are not doing enough to keep them going. Defying Gravity | Synchronized Roller Coasters (Wicked) by Tube Cody I get made fun of a lot as having a somewhat chaotic definition of essay, but I’m sticking to my guns on this one: this roller coaster is a video essay. A lot of video essays come from a film background, and use the tools of filmmaking to develop their ideas. But those aren’t the only tools available to us! Sometimes we can make meaning through roller coaster design. And if you’re not convinced, listen to him talk about how and why he made the choices that he did. Video essayist on YouTube and Nebula who often uses video games as a springboard to speak about larger topics of art, philosophy, and politics. His first book, How a Game Lives, is available now from all major booksellers. This year, I’ve been thinking about the different generations of mainstream YouTube video essayists. While the first wave of YouTube essayists may have been inspired by film, television, and/or written essays, many popular 2025 creators are young enough that they grew up alongside the video essay. This younger cohort has been presented a goal that didn’t previously exist! While the first generation of essayists may have turned to YouTube in an attempt to ‘do something’ with their film and philosophy degrees, younger creators may indeed pursue certain fields of study with the goal of disseminating this knowledge as a video essayist. While the goal of becoming a YouTuber can result in a passion for algorithmic success over academic rigor, this new generation is also willing to push the boundaries of the familiar form, creating more ambitious and stylistically striking projects. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre The best video essay of the year, Alexandre’s work melds text and form in a dizzyingly ambitious trip through an unspeakably awful question: should trans people reduce their social visibility in an act of self-preservation? The essay itself, shot in extreme widescreen, builds a sense of paranoia – Alexandre herself only takes up a fraction of the scene and the urban landscape, cold and artificially lit, stretches out beyond her. It’s a testament to the video’s magnitude that Alexandre literally being tear gassed on the streets of Montreal is only its second most striking scene. The most striking is when she taps into the feed of a public surveillance camera, finding production quality in the constant, unwilling scrutiny she lives under. The 25 Best Films of 2024: A Video Countdown by David Ehrlich A countdown of the best films of 2024, sans traditional script or voiceover, seems outside the realm of typical video essay. And yet, Ehrlich’s 23-minute montage isn’t just a countdown but a conversation made through editing, a weaving together of hundreds of cinematic motifs from an entire year. The montage finds constant moments of delight in juxtaposition: the overture features scenes of Anora, Megalopolis, Dune, Challengers, and dozens more all choreographed together to a song from The Greatest Showman. I Saw the TV Glow functions as a meta-framing device throughout the montage – Justice Smith looks directly into the camera and intones “I watched these tapes over and over again, but they never got old.” The choice of musical accompaniment is, also, revelatory. In one standout sequence, Ehrlich introduces Nosferatu alongside Dion’s ‘My Heart Will Go On’, only to continue the song through his next pick, The Beast, finally climaxing alongside Dion with Challengers. The track is hilarious, yes, but also exactly captures the thematic core of each film. However, it’s the finale of the piece that cements it as Ehrlich’s best work so far. The crescendo seems to come early; after Anora (his #3 pick), the montage escalates into an ecstasy of scenes and sounds and emotion set to an epic rework of Madonna’s ‘Like a Prayer’. And when it seems the montage can rise no higher… it doesn’t. It crashes back down to Earth with the sparse harmonica of Springsteen’s The Promised Land and Ehrlich’s final two picks, No Other Land and Nickel Boys. An impossible level of craft throughout. Death of the Author: An Alan Wake Series Retrospective by Noah Caldwell-Gervais Much as series protagonist Alan Wake can’t help but spiral around his own universe of autofiction, Noah Caldwell-Gervais is helplessly drawn back to developer Remedy’s series of games. Having previously covered Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control on his channel, Gervais now revisits each along a gargantuan journey to understand the layers of meaning woven throughout Alan Wake 2. Although the runtimes of many video essays have ballooned over the years, only Gervais is capable of keeping his writing on-target and engaging for nearly 200 minutes straight. And as Alan Wake 2 snakes through the themes of nearly every Remedy game, longtime fans of Gervais’ channel will see how this retrospective engages with many of his defining interests: Horror and noir, self-loathing writers, King’s Dark Tower series, goofy Rock and Roll stars. Gervais’ channel seemed incomplete without an essay on Alan Wake – and Alan Wake 2 itself seemed incomplete without an analysis by Gervais. Finally, both are settled. Art critic Backlot Connections by John Gibbs By juxtaposing filming locations and set designs, this video essay reveals the unseen ties between characters from different films and the unexpected thematic connections among them. It becomes a special cinematic space where these characters live, pass by one another, and perhaps even meet. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková By exploring the extinct star wipe film transition and its notorious history, the video essay transforms into a study in experimental media archaeology, revealing how this anachronistic artefact can still be relevant and useful today. Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video and Kapó by Alan O’Leary (OuScholPo) This video essay enters the ethical realm of Holocaust representation in cinema and creatively addresses the problem of unrepresentability: how to talk about a film that “no one has seen” and yet “no one has forgotten”? The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly We are living closer to the outbreak of a global/nuclear war than at any time since the Cold War. Yet, video essays reflecting on this are scarce. Cormac Donnelly, exploring the theme of the Anthropocene, conveys a similar sense of threat and destruction by applying the metaphor of cannibalism, media emulations, archives, and the form of an immersive trailer. Overturning Carmen’s feminicide: Materializing women’s agency through the musical by Barbara Zecchi This video essay reimagines the myth of Carmen from a feminist perspective. It stands out for its distinctive structure and form. Its tactile treatment of the material underscores its subversion of patriarchal traditions and narratives, while the ticking clock serves as a constant reminder that, in the real world, a woman is killed every ten minutes as a result of gender-based violence. gestures of thought: glance by Johannes Binotto Jean Epstein’s shimmering close-ups are boldly combined with the video essayist’s own personal archive and his wonderful music, lending the work additional sensitivity as it reflects on the elusive cinematic poetics of “shimmering images”. The Thinking Machine #95: Boro(que) Aesthetics by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin Guided by Malcolm de Chazal’s Plastic-Sense aphorisms, this video essay allows us to see Walerian Borowczyk’s Immoral Women (1979) as one might contemplate a painter’s work. And it effectively conveys Chazal’s idea that “everything on earth is sensuously connected to everything else.” Filmmaker, researcher, and lecturer in Videographic Criticism at the University of Leeds Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant Sirens by Nan Goldin (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Ordinatrices: About the Negative Spaces of Early Computing by Occitane Lacurie Black & Arab Encounters on Screen by Abiba Coulibaly Freelance film scholar and video essayist. Newly elected Fellow of the British Academy As it gets harder and harder to select only seven videos for this poll, as in the last years, I have used three parameters in the composition of my list: I had to choose works by different essayists from those for whom I voted in 2024; and my selection could only feature personal favourites in the field of videographic criticism, that is, a specific film, television and screen studies subset of the ‘video essay’. The videos also needed to be already published and freely available online, which ruled out some great works for which I will undoubtedly be voting next year. Epilogue: Remembered Video by Alan O’Leary Alan’s characteristically brilliant, generous and superbly performed, filmed and edited audiovisual work (published in December 2024) was a commissioned response to The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias, a cluster of ten videos and statements published in ASAP/J (the journal of the Association for the Study of the Arts of the Present) and curated by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper. The prompt for the cluster was Victor Burgin’s understanding of cinema as a kind of personal heterotopia (a fragmentary internal playlist or mediascape) constituted by the physical, virtual, and psychical ways in which we encounter it. As well as responding to this prompt and the videos which explored it in the main body of the issue, Epilogue: Remembered Video wonderfully articulates and exemplifies a method for videographic criticism and for humanistic criticism as such. Everyone interested in Videographic Criticism for scholarly purposes should watch it and the ten amazing videographic works with which it entered into conversation: Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú; Potbelly by Dayna McLeod; Fred Astaire’s Cane Hits My Brain by Will DiGravio; The Bijou Room by Desirée J. Garcia; The Uneasiness of Being a Subject: Queriendo sin querer by Jeffrey Romero Middents; Atmospheres of History in Larisa Shepitko’s Films by Viktoria Paranyuk; Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement by Amanda Doxtater; Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard; Desidentificación by Maillim Santiago; and Alterity Onscreen: A Gen-X Mediascape by Allison Cooper. Uncontaining Horror: 20th Century Spanish Women’s Meshes of Fear by Barbara Zecchi Published in December 2024 in the Spanish audiovisual essay journal Tecmerin. Revista de Ensayos Audiovisuales, Barbara’s video is one of the most original and powerful scholarly video essays I have watched, making an argument about women’s film authorship that really counts. Using two concepts from horror cinema as a theoretical framework – Eugenie Brinkema’s “genrelessness” and Jane Gaines’s “uncontainment” – Uncontaining Horror reinterprets films by 20th-century Spanish women directors that have not traditionally been classified as horror, offering a broader and certainly much less androcentric understanding of the genre. Not at Home by Deborah Martin Debbie’s video is a short but fabulously assembled split screen video essay that compares sequences from two films, The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1951) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Céline Sciamma, 2019), emphasising correspondences in the dynamics of space, gender, and movement in the films, and in their use of gothic conventions. It was published by [in]Transition: Journal of Videographic Film and Moving Image Studies, alongside brilliantly insightful reviews by Alison Peirse and Benjamin Sampson, in a double issue overflowing with remarkable works. I have singled it out as for me it is the perfect study of two of my all-time favourite films and is very much a video I will watch again and again, and would have loved to have made myself. I can’t wait for more of Debbie’s highly original videographic studies of space, uncanniness, queerness and horror to be published. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Lucy’s work is always brilliant and this video (deserved winner of the audiovisual essay competition at the Marienbad Film Festival in 2025) is both strikingly and uncannily so. Importantly, it succeeds in its aim of exploring the videographic form as a queer methodology. Departing from some of Lucy’s observations about space in Midsommar (Ari Aster, 2019), and using a variety of videographic editing techniques (multiscreen, image flipping, and mirroring, repetition, looping, reversing direction) as well as filming new material, her work takes up Sara Ahmed’s spatial understanding of queerness from her book, Queer Phenomenology, as she explains to great effect in her remarkable accompanying maker’s statement. Published in December 2024, ‘(dis)Orienting horror: feeling queerly’ is part of an extremely rich (first ever videographic) special issue on ‘Queer/ing Horror’, published by the Canadian horror journal Monstrum, guest edited by artist and video essayist extraordinaire Dayna McLeod, which also features amazing videographic work by Felicia Cosey (Jouissance at the Margins: Revisiting Bersani’s Is the Rectum a Grave? Through the Lens of Swallowed), Alex Hall (Lick the Blade: Locating a Queer Archive of Debris in Roberta Findlay’s The Oracle), Max Ranieri (We’re All Scrolling Through the World’s Fair: Online Horror Fiction as a Site of Queer Identity Formation), Heather O. Petrocelli and May Santiago (Queer + Horror), Ada Rosen (Inside(s) Out), Julia Erhart and Susan Bruce (Decentering Monstrosity in The Children’s Hour (1961)), Darren Elliott-Smith (Every creak, every groan, every tap in the wall, you’ll think of me: Spinning the Web of Trans*-Horror Metaphors in Cobweb (2023)), and Alison Peirse (I Can Hear Someone Coming). The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell For me, 2024–25 saw a surge in what might be regarded as ‘feature film length’ audiovisual essay projects, or certainly ones which, in their length, production ambitions and sometimes budgets, far exceeded the scope of most scholarly videographic work. Several examples of this trend are Christian Keathley’s hugely compelling 2024 work Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley, and Kevin B. Lee’s recently premiered urgent and fascinating desktop documentary Afterlives (Germany-Belgium-France 2025), Lúcia Nagib’s fabulously hybrid essay film/audiovisual essay Films to Die For (2025), as well as Steve Anderson’s recent film Reality Frictions. None of these are yet publicly viewable online, so remain beyond the scope of my selection. By far my favourite publicly available online work of extended scope is Jason Mittell’s amazing videographic serial project, a brilliant follow up to his recent reflexive study of Nathan Fielder’s TV show The Rehearsal. This time, he focuses on The Show About The Show, a webseries by filmmaker Caveh Zahedi that documents his life and the process of making the series. Jason’s project is at the cutting edge, both of video-essaying and academic research by practice, here, the practice of reflexive imitation of media works. It’s also extremely funny, highly ambitious, and very thought-provoking and original on the politics and ethics of contemporary nonfiction ‘film’making. Jason’s essential and informative introduction to the work is online here. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, and Jiří Žák It’s been another great year for the dynamic videographic duo Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková, who also published the remarkable and hilarious work The Return of the Star Wipe at [in]Transition in June 2025. I also love their important and formally innovative collaboration with Jiří Žák on Czech cinema made for the Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive Dossier published by MOVIE: A Journal of Film Criticism. Focusing on three films, 26 frames, and a single GIF, A Tale of Two Desktops proposes a new vision of archival film, one that builds on and departs from Jiří Anger’s award-winning 2024 book Towards a Film Theory from Below: Archival Film and the Aesthetics of the Crack-Up. Like the earlier video essays I have selected for this year’s poll, this work is a model of creative scholarship, in other words, it is the result of a disciplined process, using artistic as well as intellectual methods, for creating credible knowledge that can receive and withstand critical scrutiny, and which is able to be built upon by others as it itself has built on earlier studies. The Thinking Machine #93: Longing by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin Last but far from least, I have selected Longing, one of the many dozens of amazing works by the longstanding masters of film criticism in audiovisual essay form, Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin, in their ongoing collaboration for the online Dutch film magazine Filmkrant. It was hard to single out just one work by them from 2025, but I really loved this one about the striking similarities between two films starring Tilda Swinton, 35 years apart: Friendship’s Death (Peter Wollen, 1987) and Three Thousand Years of Longing (George Miller, 2022). Like those two films, Longing is a beautiful, powerful and insightful work. Assistant Professor at IULM University and co-editor of [in]Transition Every year it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the many fascinating works that are published online, presented at public events such as festivals and showcases, and so on. Choosing personal favourites is even harder. This list includes some of the works that have most prompted me to reflect, inspired me, and opened up new research possibilities for me. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant As someone interested in women’s labour in film production, I was truly struck by the inventive and surprising ways Grant and Bell find to explore and visually convey the work of script supervisor Penny Eyles. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell In this series, Jason Mittell experiments by adopting certain formal traits of the object he analyses – seriality and self-reflexivity – in clever and original ways, thus devising a complex and innovative methodological approach Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Afterlives is a feature film and, given its production value, perhaps shouldn’t be on this list. Still, it represents the most accomplished outcome of an aesthetic and methodology Lee has developed in his practice as a video essayist. It is both a theoretical reflection on the image and a moving, profound meditation on the limits of the visible. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The research Jiří and Veronika are conducting on the archaeology of video technology and the early years of digital media is truly compelling. By focusing on marginal and eccentric forms within the history of audiovisual technology, they reveal the intricate ties between aesthetics, technology, and the economics of the moving image. Backlot Connections by John Gibbs Some years ago, the work of Mark Rappaport and his book The Secret Life of Moving Shadows sparked in me a fascination not only for studio backlots and props histories, but also for the video essay as a tool capable of making invisible connections visible and accessible. This is precisely what John Gibbs achieves, with precision and elegance, in Backlot Connections. Locarno parla italiano – 404!: Glitching Locarno Film Festival by Silvia Cipelletti and Evelyn Kreutzer The video essay speaks Italian! I watched Silvia and Evelyn develop this project brilliantly during a workshop in Locarno, and the way they turned obstacles into creative opportunities is incredibly clever. AV essayist and media scholar, and researcher of gimmicky artefacts Potential of sketches, playfulness of research questions, unexpected conclusions from close readings, ephemeral phenomena, as well as work that enters the territory of violent imagery. Research in videographic scholarship and the essay film form does not operate within fixed or predetermined boundaries. My picks reflect this, in no particular order. Vampire Optics by Allan Cameron From Kittler’s reading of vampires in relation to recording and copying technologies such as the typewriter and the phonograph, to Shane Denson’s analysis of Frankenstein and the advent of sound in moving pictures, or Jiří Anger’s reading of early films in which a spliced and re-glued frame in an analogue strip produces a Frankensteinian moment at the levels of both materiality and perception, I have developed a deep appreciation for understanding monsters (their bodies, powers, and vulnerabilities) as inseparable from the media that shape them. Cameron’s audiovisual essay traces vampires along a similar path, yet refuses to stop at the boundaries of medium specificity. Instead, it follows the screen vampire’s unique relationship with light, thus revealing an interconnected network of ‘vampire optics’: mirrors, shadows, shimmer, focus, flicker, and more. The video essay is connected to Cameron’s Visceral Screens: Mediation and Matter in Horror Cinema; you can watch the essay first and then read the book, or reverse the order. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee The Medusa of Hatra becomes a single image that opens up an entire network of interconnected questions about who has the right to know, to protect, and to use cultural heritage. It sits at the crossroads of ISIS propaganda, violent imagery, the politics of digital archives, and the ethics of remembering. It forces us to ask: Who is being remembered, by whom, and by what means? Who shapes the narrative, and who is shaped by it? Underlying these questions is a deeper one: where does agency reside, and where does it dissolve into forms of being interpreted, mediated, or spoken for by others? For Kevin, vulnerability does not arise merely from viewing a brutal or violent image. It comes from navigating the tensions and voices that gather around these questions, existing within an ever-evolving discourse of power… The film stands as the culmination of years of filmmaking and research, and it is a film well worth seeing. Also read Seeing without Seeing – Towards a Generative Archival Practice. Toute la data du monde by Evelyn Kreutzer A connection emerges with the voice-over from Alain Resnais’s Toute la mémoire du monde, which reflects on the library as a system of memory. Evelyn extends this parallel by proposing a way of approaching AI as a system that not only structures memory but actively produces it. This idea resonates with Kevin’s Afterlives, especially in the section where AI appears as the only remaining archive of certain (here, extremist) images. The audiovisual essay therefore positions AI not merely as a tool of image production but as a system of knowledge, power, and memory that demands investigation. It suggests that we should not be intimidated by these black-box, seemingly shiny tools, but instead look closely at what lies within them. Good to pair with Silvia Cipelletti’s piece Memoria Algoritmica. For a broader context, one might go to see Alan Warburton’s Wizard of AI. Imaging Orphée / Orphée imaginé by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski What if Jacques Demy had made Parking differently? Imaging Orphée plays with this alternative past, through editing, remixing, and counterfactual speculation, it explores how his 1985 queer musical might have taken another form. In dialogue with Demy’s style and contemporary media, a new Orpheus emerges, singing across time and cultures. Drawing on an eclectic corpus and on what we know of Demy’s craft, Imaging Orphée uses videographic means to envision how the past itself might have unfolded otherwise, a mode of analysis that becomes an act of playful reinvention. If the piece invites us to re-imagine other films, then it is an invitation worth accepting. A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek A reconfiguration of a film and its afterlife (through memes, videos, ads, and other artefacts) into the single frame of a web browser, forming one associative stream, a never-ending analysis. I would love to see more similar analytical work that unfolds within the scope of a single virtual window or a single frame, much like how TikTok or an Instagram Reel can operate, as Hysterical Melancholy / Cyber Trash does for digital nostalgia. Comedy Objects #1: Slapstick Speculation by Noah Teichner When you are watching film comedies, what do you focus on? The predicaments of the main character, the misbehaviour of everything around them, the jokes? Noah focuses on Hollywood film comedies from the 1930s. To do so, he is able to connect the humour and the language (the delivery of the jokes) to the omnipresence of the financial crisis. A close reading of figures of speech, gesture, and music places film comedies less in the realm of frivolous slips of the tongue and more within the logic of the system, financial system. In researching the history and phenomenon of slapstick comedies, this essay pairs nicely with Petr Král’s Le Burlesque ou Morale de la tarte à la crème, even though they approach the subject from slightly different perspectives. Published as part of a special issue of the journal Images secondes on Cinema and Financial Speculation (edited by Occitane Lacurie and Barnabé Sauvage). Television Still Delivers People: Re-Creating the 1973 Video Manifesto by Richard Serra and Carlotta Fay Schoolman through Multiple Screens and Various Media by Jaap Kooijman About our relationship to the screen, about our subjectivity and agency, and about the very idea of a mass medium; about the fact that there is not just one television screen but many, and whether ‘mass’ even remains a meaningful category. A playful media-archaeological sketch, not yet published. Presented as a work-in-progress at NECS 2025. Video essayist Part Time Video Essayist Full Time Video Essay Enjoyer You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) With the rise of AI in the past few years, I have seen many coworkers, friends and family members all sort of ‘give up’ when it comes to the small amount of writing they are challenged with. This video really tackles this trend and comes from a unique position of a teacher who still believes in his students. Also there’s a part which mentions Baby Gronk that made me cry, which is definitely the only time that will happen (I hope). You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel “And you may ask yourself, ‘Well, how did I get here?’” These words really struck me in David Byrne’s True Stories, Big Joel’s You are into Mousetrap Youtube struck me in a very similar way. The internet is a wide and weird place and we all find ourselves in unique and specific rabbit holes. You are likely not into Mousetrap Youtube but there’s something in its place that fascinates you. You Seem Like You Wouldn’t Clap for Tinkerbell by Afterthoughts A very raw essay about someone’s own struggle wrestling with their belief that I would imagine everyone with a loved one they’ve lost can relate to. Impressively it was all written, filmed and edited for a 48 hour collab. What’s Stopping You? (Spoiler: It’s You) by Nathan Zed Brilliant editing, tight writing, and a warm reminder to nourish that same child-like passion you had for something in the first place. Another classic. A Video Essay About Efficiency by Pillar of Garbage A clever video essay metaphor used to tackle what is lost in shortcuts made in our everyday lives. The Musical Easter Egg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by Kikikrazed This unlocked a connection I completely missed on my first watch of Close Encounters, it helped me further understand what Spielberg and company were going for in this film and I’m a little excited to give it a rewatch from that lens. Camp Rock Is About Food Poisoning by Indietrix A thorough analysis of Camp Rock’s haphazard portrayal of food safety done with tons of comedy and an appreciation for the profession. Media scholar and video essayist; University of Minnesota a rumble from the core of the earth by Laura Del Vecchio and Katarzyna Paszkiewicz I am beyond impressed how this video essay achieves the core mission of videographic scholarship – making a compelling, theoretically sophisticated, and novel argument both in the written statement as well as the audiovisual material. Challenging the notions of Western-centric knowledge production and perception is easier said than done; yet, the exquisite editing offers the viewer not only the space to critically reflect on but to experience what it means to “listen otherwise”. The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly Like in some of his other works, Donnelly’s layering of tactility – from the visual framing and the materiality of the visual and audio clips to the body horror of the depicted cannibalism – manages to create a horrifying visceral aftereffect that is simultaneously highly entertaining and deeply disturbing. Cheezit Timeline by Benedetta Andreasi I love how Andreasi’s response to technical issues creates a meditation on the intimacy and precarity of sharing one’s own creative process in the form of the editing timeline. Instead of minimising proximity, the physical embodiment of both the creator and their surroundings introduces an unexpected distance to the work – the anxiety I feel over the filled cup at the centre reflecting the refusal to let me get too close. Classif & Me (Laird’s Constraint) by Alan O’Leary A perfect example of the productive energy of constraints that invite and ultimately necessitate subversion. I have a deep appreciation for how O’Leary makes room for what he calls errors in his work that prove themselves as rich points of engagement. The video is playful yet contemplative and intellectually thought-provoking. Short film programmer, artistic leader at Go Short My picks are drawn primarily from the film festival circuit. In no particular order: Zodiac Killer Project by Charlie Shackleton Deconstructing true crime tropes with much humour, and somehow still making it a thrilling true crime watch. The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos Very powerful archive essay; by recontextualising images creating a space to reflect on the oppression of Palestinian people. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Maryam Tafakory delivering her annual banger; this time with some breathtaking colours. happiness by Fırat Yücel How to carry the weight of the world’s pain when it’s constantly live-broadcast to our screens; no one can sleep until everyone is free. A Reconnaissance by Stefan Kruse With each film Stefan Kruse is diving deeper into the world of surveillance. This time he’s so invested he even steps away from his computer, finding himself at a Maltese airport standing alongside plane spotters to capture images of a covert drone. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen More like a video column maybe? Film curator and lecturer at Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD), where she gives a course on the power of representation in contemporary cinema with a focus on gender, decolonial and ecological studies. These works expand the territory of the essay film, one in which individual subjectivities operate as critical lenses onto broader socio-political structures. Mobilising strategies drawn from archival material, autofiction, forensic aesthetics, and postcolonial critique, the films interrogate the conditions under which memory, identity, and power are created. The works foreground the essay film as a site of epistemological resistance: a cinematic practice that both questions dominant narratives and experiments with the forms through which knowledge itself can be constructed, destabilised, and reclaimed. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory This film is a lyrical, politically charged meditation in which a young woman’s first love story with a woman blooms amid the shadows of state violence, weaving intimate confession with the unspoken traumas of Iran’s night-gardens. The film beautifully and powerfully weaves flowers, manuscript illuminations and film excerpts that create a film of love and desire that transcends the power structures. Cold Call by Stefanie Schroeder In a personal essay on the very act of writing, the filmmaker meets digital scam culture, transforming an intrusive phone call into an unexpected portrait of vulnerability, creative paralysis, and accidental resistance. Stefanie Schroeder’s film questions the intimate through cyber vigilantism, racism and power relationships. The rhythm of her film is particularly interesting as her personal story develops in parallel to the person on the other side of the line. Sixty-Seven Milliseconds by Fleuryfontaine This forensic, hybrid investigation traces the path of a single bullet through motion capture and CGI, exposing the distortions of policing and the politics embedded in every frame of surveillance. Fleuryfontaine’s (Antoine Fontaine and Galdric Fleury) film resonates a lot with recent violent events that happened in Switzerland. Nsala by Mickael-Sltan Mbanza The film is a haunting use of colonial archives that merges silence, fiction, and contemporary imagery to reclaim erased histories and rehumanise those frozen in exploitative imagery. Mickael-Sltan Mbanza plays with colonial archives and contemporary footage to fictionally recount the story of a couple recruited to work in a mine under colonial rule. I Can’t Think of Anything Right Now by Hussen Ibraheem A rain-soaked, metaphysical road film where a simple ride slips into a dreamlike detour through memory, exile, and the fragile boundaries between forgetting and survival. In Hussen Ibraheem’s film, water carries the past and the future of those who are trapped in between memories and exile. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen Abortion Party is a chaotic, irreverent autobiographical film that turns a fraught reproductive decision into an absurd, messy celebration of chosen family, bad timing, and the dark comedy of youth. Julia Mellen’s film is witty and opens up to new ways of celebrating dark times. Lost Songs of Sundari by Sudarshan Sawant The film proposes a gentle, elegiac triptych of voices reflecting on Mumbai’s shifting shorelines, capturing the quiet vanishing of coastal worlds reshaped, almost erased, by relentless urban expansion. Sudarshan Sawant creates an essay where the living and the non-living find a common space in an ever reshaping landscape. Video essayist and music producer under the name Kai After Kai. Also producer, co-writer, and composer for the horror fiction podcast Kingscreek The Most Boring Place in Tears of the Kingdom? by Any Austin Video games, perhaps by nature, tend to be pretty goal/purpose oriented. One of the first things you might ask about that game is “what do you DO in it?” But recently I’ve found myself developing a sort of fondness for moments in games that give me the opportunity to simply do ‘nothing’ – games that have things with no ‘purpose’ or ‘meaning’, but simply ‘are’. This video by Any Austin echoes that growing fascination – a video that explores areas in the Zelda game Tears of the Kingdom that objectively have no practical gameplay purpose, but nonetheless have their own value in spite of that due to simply being there. From helping enhance an adventure game’s roleplaying elements to helping to curate a sense of player expectation and anticipation, it’s clear that moments like these have merit in gaming, and I’m glad to see it explained so well. The Opposite of Cosmic Horror by Tale Foundry It’s a real mark of quality and impact when a work changes the way I think about and process the world, even if in the most minute way. As a massive fan and now creator of cosmic horror, I’m used to dreaming up concepts and monsters far larger than any one person could ever imagine or even process, but this video exposed to me how that feeling can, ironically, still lead to a form of anthropocentrism. Rarely do we give much thought to those smaller than us — much smaller — who might look up at us and feel their sense of scale and understanding of the universe fall out from under them. The pests that scurry between our walls, the vermin that hide in our corners, the objects of so much fear and hate from ourselves, but have we ever really considered how they feel? Have *I* ever considered how they feel when I cast my shadow over them and, without a second thought, end their existence and continue like they were simply nothing? I can say that I do. Now. When Death Note Broke Its Own Rules by Sloan Stowe Part of why I make videos could be said to be ‘obsession’. That is to say, my videos are born from feelings when something, no matter how big or small, crawls over my brain, leaving its impact all over as it grasps my mind and refuses to let go. In that sense, I think I may have found a kindred spirit. Sloan spends half an hour examining a scene less than a fifth of that length, but not a single second is wasted. Every one is filled with some kind of analysis of cinematography, localisation, animation, acting, sound design, all in service of unpacking everything buried underneath these four minutes of anime characters talking in the rain. It is the kind of video born when something truly takes root in you and demands to be acknowledged, demands to be explored. It’s something I truly love to see, in myself yes, but especially in others. Video essayist (as LambHoot) and solutions architect So many video essayists leaned into irreverence this year. If you’re like me, a wave of borderline comedy essays flew through your sub feed. Many messed with tone, interlacing absurd subject matter and harsh delivery into the usual structure. In nonchalant voices, authors spread messages, opined inconclusively on difficult topics, and counted how many functional urinals there were in video games. Many of my picks showed rather than told. The medium felt so much more self-aware. I had a blast watching all of these. I Studied for My Citizenship Test with Assassin’s Creed 3 by SolidArf I’ve watched enough YouTube to know to always click any Assassin’s Creed 3 video essays that bless your timeline. SolidArf’s timely piece examines how many of the US citizenship test’s questions are answered accurately by the game’s content, and ultimately evolves into a critique of both. How Many Times Can You Pee in Heavy Rain? by Allie Meowy Genuinely the most ‘laugh out loud’ video essay this year (maybe ever). An absolutely absurd premise leads to an examination of granularity and detail in virtual worlds. Like if AVGN made video essays (I swear this is a compliment). Bluey Is Perfect, and That Terrifies Me by MML’s Commentaries Matt examines his biases as a child of separated parents, confronting his anxieties about potential parenthood. I wasn’t familiar with Bluey before this, but the video helped me understand why so many parent friends praise the show. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre The most ‘show, don’t tell’ video essay of the year, so much so that it literally takes your peripheral vision to watch. No other video essayist put themselves on the front line as much as Lily did this year (again, literally). A raw examination of visibility, vulnerability, and safety. Recommended post-watch read: Unlearning Shame (Devon Price, 2024). A Narrative Analysis of Space Invaders by Chariot Rider Some of my favourite videos are Chariot Rider’s. I can’t discuss this one’s subject matter without spoiling a twist that made me laugh out loud… but I can say that Chariot is the master of extracting a mile from an inch. My Quest to Uncover the Mystery of Death Stranding 2’s Porters by Writing on Games My favourite Writing on Games videos are those where he points a camera at something benign long enough for a meaningful narrative to emerge from it. By following random NPCs long after they would naturally de-spawn, Hamish highlights aspects of the world’s design he’d otherwise miss. Like watching a leaf under a microscope and remembering how alive it really is. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord Another terrific video I can’t possibly spoil. I didn’t know the Backrooms were real photographs until watching this, but I’m gladly less unsettled by them now. Kendra digs through blueprints and renovation documents to trace a cause-and-effect chain from a 1910s department store to the modern-day meme. Associate Professor in Audiovisual Arts and Cognition at the University of Groningen, NL / co-author of Film Studies in Motion: From Audiovisual Essay to Academic Research Video Trying to get a grip on a year’s videographic production is becoming increasingly difficult as the output grows exponentially over time. This unavoidably results in a highly personal selection (and potentially less overlap among the videos chosen by others), which is good news because it also indicates a quickly increasing videographic scene and community. Where Do You Put the Camera? by Every Frame a Painting (Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou) Every Frame a Painting has only released a single video in 2025, which is bad news for all cinephiles who appreciate Tony Zhou’s meticulous research, clarity in argumentation, and seamless delivery, but good news for all other video essayists who will now have a chance to make it to our best-of-the-year lists. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse Delicately balancing between the subjective-personal (“when I watch horror films, I wrap myself in crochet blankets”) and the objective-scholarly (“crochet is … a portent, a warning of impending horror”), this simple but superbly edited and soundtracked supercut video makes mediated crochet almost tangible. Cineradiographic Vision by Onur Turgut The term cineradiography, which gives the project its title, underscores the capacity of imaging technologies to reveal the anatomy of cinematic space, both metaphorically, by unraveling spatial meaning, and perceptually, by disrupting visual norms. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, Jiří Žák Do you, as a teacher of early cinema, struggle to make the audiovisual past relevant to the current generation of your students? By examining “how nitrate film materials from the beginnings of cinema – with all their weird shapes, textures, and visual quirks – survive and circulate in the digital age,” this well-researched and excellently produced hands-on film archaeological experiment offers a brilliant solution. Google Mapping Blow-Up: A Desktop Remediation by Cáit Murphy This video, which combines one of my favourite films (Blowup), activities (film-induced tourism), and videographic methods (desktop documentary), checks off many of my cinephile boxes. The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar A shot-to-shot AI remake of the montage sequence from Alan J. Pakula’s 1974 The Parallax View is my favourite conceptual video essay of the year. Audiovisual essayists, writers, cinephiles 100 Years of History in 100 Films by kaptainkristian Reaching the year 2001 / Reaching the film 2001. From there, the timeline collapsed. Another timeline was added. And what ‘it’ showed was parallel to what we saw, or perhaps its inner face/essence. Is the inner face of 2019 Blade Runner (1982)? Is Steve Jobs 2015 or 1998… and The Matrix, which is its very, very own year itself. Reaching 2002 and 2005, following the passage through the inter-dimensional gates of Kubrick’s 2001, and Patlabor 2 followed – the iron mecha hands; the iron hands of Zuckerberg/Eisenberg that wrote our destiny – where you understand-don’t-understand where we are anymore. The transcendence of a seemingly simple idea, a seemingly simple[minded] understanding. The nervousness of the discrepancy between that year in history and the film’s production year. How masculine and phallic the century we have passed through is (if not the entire last millennium!); even Freddie Mercury in concert is along the same lines. 1979 must be Iran, right: The Masculine-Barbaline revolution. In your mind, you have the films’ production years in parallel, and aside from the simple fact that the story of many films takes place in a year different from their production year, this tells us something about ‘time’; is Blade Runner just arriving in 2019? We’ve gone way past that! Reaching the ticking seconds of the doomsday clock: The outer/inner face of these final years. All the films are beautiful here. Even all the ones you hate are redeemed here. The Matrix, Blade Runner, 2001: The electricity of these three dispersed panels. And opening with Ordet, with creator’s own signature on the image. The senses of The Silence of the Lambs by Lara Callaghan, Adam Woodward (Little White Lies) Sometimes you need a little silence to be touched. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Films are carried by the hands of their lovers [through history]; by their shadows. Associate Professor of Media Studies, University of Amsterdam Fading Echoes: Remembering and Forgetting through Videotapes by Vladimir Rosas-Salazar This audiovisual essay shows that videographic criticism can be an effective form to address media archaeology. Composed of home-made footage, Fading Echoes demonstrates how video can serve as a tool for remembering while simultaneously revealing how memories fade through the medium’s own material degradation. By foregrounding glitches, deterioration, and other traces of wear, the piece connects these visual ruptures to José van Dijck’s concept of mediated memories, emphasising not only how media shape remembrance but also how they contribute to forgetting. The result is a moving, personal, and poetic visualization of the intertwined processes through which memories are both captured and lost. Not at Home by Deborah Alexandra Martin The dual split screen, placing a sequence from one film alongside a sequence from another, is a well-established technique in videographic criticism. Consider, for example, Kogonada’s What is Neorealism? or Liz Greene’s Velvet Elephant. Not at Home fits seamlessly into this tradition, inviting a compare-and-contrast between the films The Innocents (Clayton, 1951) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Sciamma, 2019). By juxtaposing these (seemingly unedited) sequences with a focus on the candle as a prop, the audiovisual essay raises relevant questions about femininity and space, bringing the films into a rich dialogue that goes beyond just compare-and-contrast. Not at Home demonstrates how effective this relatively simple split-screen technique is. The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds by Mathias Bonde Korsgaard The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds is a supercut of 61 ‘canonical’ music videos, one from every year between 1964 and 2024, together presenting a history of music video in an eclectic and rapidly edited style reminiscent of the so-called MTV aesthetic – with a sidenote that the supercut is in chronological order. That these music videos are indeed canonical becomes clear, at least to me, as it takes only a snippet (both visually and audibly) to recognise them. Although the supercut itself is quite short (in fact 135 seconds rather than the stated 169 seconds), it is accompanied by a relatively extensive written text that not only clarifies the criteria for selecting the featured videos but also reflects on the scholarly need to establish a canon. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková One can easily be deceived by the playful presentation of The Return of the Star Wipe, as the voice-over and the editing adopt a tongue-in-cheek tone that mirrors the kitschy nature of the star-wipe transition itself. Yet this funny and even nostalgic presentation proves highly effective in delivering a well-researched and convincing argument in media archeology. The audiovisual essay demonstrates the added value of videographic criticism, as no written article could so effectively and vividly discuss the mechanics and cultural relevance of this admittedly tacky technique. The Return of the Star Wipe is not only a delight to watch but an illuminating and informative exploration of an often-overlooked element in media history. Postdoctoral researcher, video essayist, curator, Università della Svizzera italiana I want to make one important disclaimer: In past years, to avoid any conflict of interest, I usually abstained from nominating any pieces in which I was directly involved (as editor or consultant, for example) or by video essayists with whom I have a particularly close and current working relationship. This year, two of my nominations (by Lee and by Cipelletti) are exceptions to this rule but I believe they are warranted because they present important milestones in the larger video essay landscape with regards to videographic output’s migration into other fields of media production and consumption. Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley by Christian Keathley Chris Keathley’s long-form video essay/film presents three seemingly totally disparate starting points (a personal, autobiographical reflection; a local history; and a film- and industry-historical investigation) and then beautifully and affectively integrates them with each other. The film is touching, whimsical, highly informative and tonally precise, and a real template for videographic engagements with audiovisual history, memory, and lived experience. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková One of the most entertaining and original video essays of the recent past. I applaud the makers for their originality — in terms of topic (who else would think to make a video essay about a particular, largely forgotten editing transition?) and in terms of their own videographic style that is both very true to the history they lay out, and yet very recognizable in its authorial signature. It’s a great example of how the video essay can emulate, play with, and indulge in the tonal registers of its object of analysis. The Water Diaries, or My Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi A beautiful, poetic, and pensive meditation on water and film as they both move us and connect us to the world and our imaginations. Beginning with the maker’s reflections on what it means for her to be present in a specific film-institutional site (Locarno Film Festival) and connecting it (via water images and metaphors) to the oeuvre of a specific film auteur (Jane Campion), the video moves from the personal to the analytical and from the local to the global in a seamless, rhythmic flow. Why Do I Love These VICIOUS Queens? by Matt Baume Matt Baume’s videos are generally thoroughly researched, highly entertaining, and great documentaries of the (often hidden, often tumultuous) queer stories in Hollywood and mainstream media history. I like this one in particular because it picks up a personal question of taste (in the title) to go into a much larger investigation into TV history, the history of queer representation, and transatlantic media comparisons. the decline in literacy & rise in ai by silver fox A very DIY and formally simple investigation into a huge and pressing societal concern: literacy and media consumption among young people in the age of AI. Made by a gen-Z youtuber about a primarily gen-alpha phenomenon and building on the maker’s commentary and numerous social media videos and testimonials, it is an acute call for awareness that I take seriously and appreciate. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee As I mentioned in my disclaimer, I closely work with Kevin B. Lee and have witnessed him work on this project tirelessly for several years, so I am admittedly biased. I want to stress, however, that this is a major step in video essay history – after many years of developing the desktop documentary format in the larger realm of video essay culture, Lee has now produced a feature-length documentary film that develops this methodology into a large-scale archival, media-reflexive, and politically acute investigation that is screening at major film festivals at the moment. Memoria Algoritmica by Silvia Cipelletti Here’s my second highly biased nomination – for a video essay by my colleague Silvia Cipelletti, which presents another major milestone in video essay development. Produced first for a public screening event at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, an alternative, new version of the video essay was then commissioned by Arte.tv (one of the most important and prestigious European TV channels and producers of cultural innovation). I like both versions a lot (the original video essay and the TV version) and believe they serve as great case studies to compare how the same argumentation might be adapted to different media ecologies. I applaud both Cipelletti and Arte for this transition of videographic content as it migrates from digital platforms to museum spaces to television. Video-essayist, film critic and researcher Once again, I am taking part in this list by sharing a few works which interested me – and once again, chance (and curators) played a huge role in the way I got to see them. Also, my list is less a top than an homage to videos and videasts I love. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory I saw this film at FIDMarseille, in July 2025, a few months after Maryam Tafakory was given a ‘carte blanche’ retrospective dedicated to her work at Cinéma du Réel. The artist continues her patient mosaic work of reassembling Iranian cinema. The images are superimposed, altered and recoloured using a method that creates what can only be described as a style. Daria’s Night Flowers radicalises a return to onscreen text present in her previous works. The artist composes an herbarium of flowers immortalised by cinema, admired, displayed or picked by the female characters that her films habitually observe. On the editing table, these images encounter the illuminated flowers of the Kitab-e hashayish (کتاب حشايش), a pharmacological codex from 1595 with multicoloured illustrations. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen I saw this work, which pretends to be a videographic application to an artist grant at FIDMarseille too. Julia Mellen explains that she was inspired by a specific aesthetic associated with boomers’ social media habits – or rather, their Facebook habits – and their taste for dubious 3D modelling. At the edge of the frame, the director launches into a 13-minute uninterrupted story time – the length of the film – facing the camera, during which she recounts the organisation of a party to celebrate her abortion. This format of self-narrative, which originated with the video hosting platform YouTube before migrating and enjoying even greater success on TikTok, is more indicative of generations whose adolescence and young adulthood have been intertwined with digital technology. However, the setting for this performance, filmed in a single sequence shot, constantly bounces from one segment to another within a larger frame, reproducing the artist’s memories in 3D. It is difficult not to recognise, in this mechanical ballet, a screensaver from yesteryear, whose media archaeology takes us back to the DVD players of old. Thus, Julia Mellen’s stream of consciousness, which echoes the flow of her words, seems to be shaped by different layers of the artist’s technological and personal history. The personal is media, one thinks when seeing Abortion Party – since it demonstrates from the outset, through its very subject matter, how political the personal can be. Man Number 4 by Miranda Pennell I am really interested in Miranda Pennell’s filmic and videographic essays and I had the chance to see her latest piece at the Go Short Film Festival in Nijmegen. This work takes place in a single picture from which the film slowly zooms out, from a mosaic of pixels to faces, to surroundings, to context, to realisation. The process somehow reminded me of other videographic works: Capricorn Sunset by Johannes Binotto, or what remains by belit sağ, in which the constitutive particle of the image becomes the measuring unit of an invisible violence, contained within the representation. The picture was taken in December 2023 in Gaza, and shows mass deportation by the IDF of Palestinians, blindfolded, handcuffed, half-naked, almost as numerous as the pixels that concealed them. Very composed, the photograph evokes Goya’s painting, the digital encoding of visual information replacing the brushstroke, carrying the same ineffable violence. The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos I also saw this archival essay at Go Short. This piece is also part of a growing corpus of videographic works which try to resist the visual annihilation of Palestinian history. For this film, Panagopoulos collects a 16mm botanical diary, shot by an English scientist who was commissioned to document the flora of Mandatory Palestine in the late 1930s. Accidentally – a bit like in Kamal Al Jafari’s films – Palestinians appear among the colourful fields of flowers, working, passing by, living at the edges of the frame. At the centre of the image, often, a smiling Englishman, uprooting plants with a joyful violence, which seems to contain in germ more than a century of forthcoming history. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková They already know it: I am a huge fan of Veronika and Jiří’s work, their playful and unique approach to video essay and videographic history. They represent an essential current in our community: the archaeology of videographic creation itself. This is truly a necessary and courageous work to engage with the very history of what we take for granted (or what the design thinking made us see as natural) either software-wise or hardware-wise. To engage with these crucial questions, they always find an original path, an unexpected motif, a fascinating idea: in this case, the favourite transition of every kid that once got to play with Windows Movie Maker. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Once again, the proof is masterfully made that video essay can exist as a feature film. I do not want to say too much about this documentary which is continuing its journey in festivals – I myself have not yet had the chance to see it on a big screen. Both through its theme, its material and its method, Afterlives manages to uncover the forensic potential of video essay and to show how this form is able to reflect upon the constant reconfiguration of the contemporary visual culture, especially in the age of AI. L’Histoire politique du festival de Locarno by Cinéma et politique I had the chance to watch Clémentine Meyer’s video essay about the Locarno Film Festival… in Locarno. Working with archival material and scale models representing the actors in this extraordinary story, the videast retraces the political, economic and cinephilic layers that form the foundation of this festival, unique in Europe. From ostpolitik to erotica, this video uncovers the strong (and unexpected) tendencies that shaped the moving identity of Locarno. Assistant Professor of Japanese Film at the University of British Columbia and video essayist This year, I was drawn to works that foreground process, of making-as-thinking, of media as something that is made. The works that inspired me invite viewers, in a variety of ways, to consider how ideas take shape. They encourage us to think about the drafts behind the draft, the gestures of selection and omission, and the rhythmic negotiations between intention and accident. Each of these works feature how video essayists can think through the act of mixing and ‘meddling’, as media scholar Ritika Kaushik puts it, and they invite us to witness and feel the stages of research and experimentation that shape them. phenomenology of marco damilano by Benedetta Andreasi Developed during the Reframing the Argument videographic workshop held at Notre Dame University (summer, 2025), the piece turns its own process into an analytic method: a deliberately off-kilter voiceover unsettles the polished aesthetic of Damilano’s Il Cavallo e la Torre, exposing how broadcast news creates a comfortable distance between viewer and ‘displaced other’. The final minute of shared silence, stripped of commentary, lands with an imperative quiet force. It is a videographic gesture that reframes spectatorship itself, inviting us to sit with what mediated discourse so often smooths over. For an even more open embrace of process, and rising to the challenge of facing disruptive difficulties, I also love Benedetta’s Cheezit Timeline, hosted on the new-this-year platform Fragments: A Journal of videographic form and method developed by Cormac Donnelly, Jemma Saunders, and Will DiGravio. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod Age Perfect emerges directly from a community of practice that treats process as the argument itself. It is bold and brave and smart and everything I love about McLeod’s work. By entering the glossy world of anti-aging ads through performance and tactile re-creation, McLeod exposes the artifice behind beauty culture(s) and treats process not as something to be hidden but as the very site of discovery. In the spirit of Johannes Binotto’s Practices of Viewing via the Ways of Doing videographic exercise Making Materiality Matter, the maker lets the seams show, inviting us to witness how meaning emerges through trying things out on the timeline. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson (dis)Orientating Horror turns videographic process into a queer methodology. Also emerging from the Ways of Doing Making Materiality Matter exercise, the piece begins with a single disorienting moment from Midsommar and uses it as a generative prompt to think through horror’s habitual orientations. On the timeline, Donaldson works through this problem materially: flipping, mirroring, looping, and multiplying the image until the refusal of the ‘straight line’ becomes something you feel in your own body. The video lets us witness that process of trying, testing the film’s gestures against an idea of embodied cinema and experimenting toward a form that inhabits disorientation rather than resolving it. (dis)Orientating Horror is part of a fantastic special issue of Monstrum on Queer/ing Horror, among them Alison Peirse’s brilliant I Can Hear Someone Coming, a counterfactual, coital collection of women’s voices from 1930s horror films. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shadow Self treats videographic criticism as an evolving process of attachment, tracing how certain films take hold of us and accompany us through our own lived rhythms. The seeds of this project were planted at the Embodying the Video Essay workshop held at Bowdoin College in 2023, and that lineage shows: the piece embraces embodiment as a mode of inquiry through voice, gesture, memory, and caregiving. Quraeshi Shepard weaves Varda’s Documenteur together with her own personal footage and audio of parent–child conversations, allowing the interruptions and digressions of connectivity to become structural rather than something to edit out. This is a work that lets process remain visible while asking what happens when scholarship, spectatorship, and parenthood meet on the timeline. Miradas by Pablo Serrano Torres Like Donaldson’s (dis)Orientating Horror, Serrano Torres’ Miradas embodies process not as a preliminary stage but as the very substance of queer videographic thinking. A peer of Quraeshi Shepard’s Shadow Self, Miradas is a work first conceived at the 2023 Embodying the Video Essay workshop and as a project of that context we can see that the piece moves deliberately from solitary introspection to collaborative creation, making the maker’s body, voice, and relationships integral to its argument. While engaging deeply with scholarly theory, Miradas refuses the straight line of academic seriousness; its process is the product. It is messy. It is embodied. It is communal. And it is joyful. AI and ‘Being Human’ by Mariam Khaled and Mahima Jain There is, perhaps correctly, a proliferation of pieces engaging with AI. I find works that engage with the process of using AI (e.g., a transparency of prompts or a reflection of interaction) to be far more interesting than displays of results. AI and ‘Being Human’ is such an endeavour, and a stake-holding one at that. It treats the desktop documentary not simply as a mode of presentation but as a process of decolonial unlearning. It highlights a way of making visible how AI technologies discipline and racialise our definitions of ‘the human’ by working through autoethnographic encounters with multiple AI platforms. Here we have the friction and ambivalence that occurs when AI flattens cultural complexity into sanitised universals. This is videographic criticism that does its thinking out loud. Comedy Objects #1: Slapstick Speculation by Noah Teichner Slapstick Speculation shows how videographic methodology can treat archival research not as raw material but as an imaginative, processual space for reanimating history. By blending 1930s comedy shorts, novelty songs, and monologues with speculative fiction, the piece reconstructs Hollywood’s shift to sound through the eyes and labor of comedy workers navigating the shocks of the 1929 Crash. While that is the conceptual background of the piece, for me I can feel how video thinks across media, revealing liveness as an intermedial effect shared by vaudeville, radio, early sound film, the stock ticker, and the choice of font and text-on-screen placement. Co-head of videoessays.org and director of Afterlives This year I was fortunate to be involved in some terrific videographic projects such as the NECSUS issue of video essays on the Locarno Film Festival and a programme of video essays on AI for the Jeu de Paume. Among the exceptional works from these projects, I want to celebrate The Water Diaries: A Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi, Algorithmic Borders by Silvia Cipelletti, Toute la data du monde by Evelyn Kreutzer, and not exactly a still life by Johannes Binotto. BLKNWS: Terms and Conditions by Khalil Joseph Like watching a videographic supernova, reaching for all the stars. Enjoy utopia whenever you find it.

See Also: Ask Me for Those Unborn Promises that May Seem Unlikely to Happen in the Natural by Donatella Della Ratta and The Void Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant A quietly radical mobilization of archival materials, creating fascinating associations between a life in film and with films. See Also: Animation in London/ Matchmove in Bangalore by Suryansu Guha Mechanical Kurds by Hito Steyerl AI cinema makes its strongest impact when it collides with its real life context, like a drone missile aimed at someone who programmed it. See Also: Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, and Jiří Žák From the team that seems to be having the most fun making videographic scholarship these days. A toss-up with The Return of the Star Wipe but I went with this in solidarity with non-English-language video essays. See Also: Latencies of the Statistical Image by Roc Albalat Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Most of the choices on my list demonstrate the possibilities of video essays exposed to realities beyond screens. This edu-activist YouTube video champions new possibilities for visibility, while also arguing for the virtues of staying unseen. See Also: Before the Drop by Rosa Wernecke A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek It’s a self-contained rabbit hole. It’s a mock-fan website that holds a funhouse mirror to fan obsession. It’s a compilation of every meme that exists of a certain movie. It’s a critical retelling of that film through those memes. It’s also an installation that turns gallery spaces into sculptural doomscrolls. But… is it a video essay? There is an idea of a video essay. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real video essay. See Also: You Are Into Mousetrap Youtube by Big Joel Film critic and programmer – Cinemateca Portuguesa, IndieLisboa IFF Here are five films/videos, seen over the last year, that question our relationship with the ‘audiovisual’, with its simultaneous ability to reveal the nature of things and obscure their meaning. Soixante-sept millisecondes by Fleuryfontaine (Galdric Fleury and Antoine Fontaine) A film about trajectories, about bodies and projectiles in motion; it’s a film-denouncement, but it’s also a short treatise on the documental validity of moving images. Green Grey Black Brown by Yuyan Wang Meet Yuyan Wang, today’s most exciting video essayist. Each of her supercuts is a demonstration of the astonishing power of editing and the hypnotic potential of the ‘raccord’. Camera Test (King Cadbury) by Charlie Shackleton This year Charlie Shackleton made his new feature film, the intricate Zodiac Killer Project, but this short film is possibly his best film to date. Film archives and family memories merge with disarming simplicity. Being John Smith by John Smith The culmination of a body of work, the film that gives meaning and offers a retrospective review of a life (and a career). And it does so with the grace and self-deprecating humour that only a master is capable of mastering. 13 Alfinetes by João Pedro Rodrigues, João Rui Guerra da Mata Presented (still in a work-in-progress version) at the end of a retrospective that took place in Lisbon and Madrid, 13 Pins is, to a certain extent, the 8 ½ of João Pedro Rodrigues’s filmography. A film obsessed with circularity which, as a result, revolves simultaneously in a centripetal and centrifugal direction, closing the past and opening up the future. A Vida dos Espelhos by Saguenail and Regina Guimarães Created for the exhibition organised by the museum Casa do Cinema Manoel de Oliveira around the figure of Luis Miguel Cintra, A Vida dos Espelhos is based on a ten-hour interview between the actor and curator António Preto. It revisits the more than 20 films Cintra made with Manoel de Oliveira (plus some with Paulo Rocha), unfolding as an intricate interplay between what is spoken in voice-over and what the film excerpts reveal on screen. A meticulous revisiting of a stage-like oeuvre through the eyes of an actor formed equally by theatre and cinema – a journey of both confirmation and contradiction. Video essayist (as The Lesser Feat) and YouTube researcher who teaches Film & Television Studies at the University of Warwick All my chosen videos were published on YouTube (in some cases also Nebula), and made by non-academics. As a scholar of YouTube video essays, this seems my best chance to highlight a few different creators than some of my academic colleagues. While YouTube video essays can be about virtually any topic, I restrict myself to examples in which creators analyse at least one piece of screen media. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Thrillingly experimental but accessible, deeply anxious but defiantly poised, this is a fascinating meditation on the politics of trans visibility in the second Trump era. Alexandre’s video probes this subject partly via film analyses (e.g.: We’re All Going to the World’s Fair), but more affectingly through its formal variety: an extreme-widescreen aspect ratio clashes with perversely restricted framings, handheld self-recordings of Alexandre fleeing riot police contrast steely surveillance-camera footage, guerilla street projection and more. All navigate in different ways the political potentials, dangers, and power of the camera’s gaze. My favourite YouTube video essay of the year by some margin; in fact, one of my screen media highlights of 2025, period. When Your Hero Is a Monster by The Leftist Cooks The Leftist Cooks are the Ireland-based married couple Sarah Oeffler and Neilly Farrell, and they make some of the most consistently aesthetically ambitious and intellectually thoughtful work in the field of what used to be called BreadTube (the loose collective of further-Left-than-liberal YouTube video essayists that flourished especially during the previous Trump presidency). Here they wrestle disarmingly honestly with the problem of beloved artists who reveal themselves as undeserving of their fans’ love (in this case, primarily Neil Gaiman), with characteristic humour, earnestness, insight, and creativity. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Illustrated with charming drawings by another underrated YouTuber, Mothcub, this short work about YouTube viewing habits might be considered more of an animated short story than a video essay. I’d put it differently: like (say) David Foster Wallace’s writing, which can dance between the modes of critical essay and literature, Big Joel here pushes the YouTube analytic-essayistic mode to its most literary and lyrical. Fear of Dark by Jacob Geller This is the latest in Geller’s Fear of… series, which explores the eerie fascination of environments associated with the limits of human sensory experience (it follows Fear of Cold, …of Depths, and …of Big Things Underwater). Drawing on a dizzying multitude of expressive uses of darkness in videogames, films and visual art, Geller’s atmospheric video also embodies its theme through its own photography: evocative experiments with unnervingly low light levels help conjure feelings of dread by testing his camera’s capacity to capture true darkness. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis One of the foundational voices of the YouTube video essay returned to the platform this year after a period during which she’s largely been making work for the creator-owned platform Nebula. The result was a classic, thoughtful Ellis breakdown of a cultural controversy, now applied to a weightier topic than usual: the backlash faced by children’s YouTuber Ms Rachel for her forthright support of Gaza. Her decision to publish it on YouTube has allowed the fundraiser Ellis attached to the video to raise over $800,000 for The Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund. Film critic The Body Hysteric by Cristina Álvarez López This, the best video essay of the year, was rejected by the Marienbad Festival selection committee. Their – and their audience’s – loss. Male Gazing by David Verdeure A remarkable, thoroughgoing and very intricate treatment of a classic film, Hitchcock’s Rear Window. See and hear things you never knew were there! Nebulous Encounters by Catherine Grant Two mighty scenes in fog, from Murnau’s Sunrise and Amenábar’s The Others. Arranged simply but eloquently across two screens. All cinema is here. Queer performance-based media artist, Montreal My picks reflect what excited me about video essay making this year and are by no means exhaustive. I look forward to watching works that others will share on this list that I don’t know. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre A thorough 48-minute rumination about the stakes of trans visibility for trans people, this longform work by YouTube essayist Lily Alexandre was warmly received when I saw it on the big screen at Montreal’s Exposures, Canada’s only trans film festival. At the centre of this piece is a question about trans visibility and whom it is for. Alexandre dives in deeply to offer insightful critique of trans film and media objects complemented and complicated by protest footage, surveillance, and nighttime monologues staged in quiet outdoor locations, all invoking concerns about public spaces, safety, and risk. Do yourself a favour: close your open tabs and apps, go full-screen, and give this remarkable work your full attention. See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird What an incredible video essay! Simply one of Colleen Laird’s best, See Under: Orient was made as part of One Hundred Movies Walk into a Bar… a summer 2025 collaborative videographic workshop organised by Ariel Avissar and Laird that responded to The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century list published by The New York Times. Laird structures her video essay around definitions of ‘orient’ (with reference to Ariel Avissar’s TV Dictionary format) and explodes our screen and speakers with a captivating soundtrack, stunning multiscreens (the vertical slices in the middle of the piece are particularly enthralling), heady Google Map zooms, and a brilliant use of text that selects and directs us to just how embedded Orientalist frameworks and biases are in film culture. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant I learn so much from Catherine Grant every time I watch her work, and this piece co-created with film historian Melanie Bell about film continuity and the life and work of script supervisor Penny Eyles is no exception. A masterclass in video essay making, this video essay uses an intricate layout reminiscent of a video editing interface where we are challenged to decode Grant’s arrangement of scenes and sources as they play out, exemplifying Grant’s renowned engagement with material thinking. Centred around Sally Potter’s Orlando, Grant expertly takes us through the unseen labour of Eyles through archive, documentary, and extracted scenes from British films produced between 1943 and 2012. What a treat! (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson This award-winning video essay (Marienbad Film Festival, 2025) is a pleasure to watch. Fife Donaldson mirrors, flips, and layers landscape shots from horror films that fill the frame with a disorienting sense of foreboding made eerie and uncanny through repetition of sound and image. Fully interrogating Sara Ahmed’s work on queer orientation from her book Queer Phenomenology, Fife Donaldson artfully uses text on screen with a delicious colour palette that exemplifies its content. Full disclosure: this video essay appears in a special issue of Monstrum entitled Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, which I edited. I Can Hear Someone Coming by Alison Peirse Alison Pierse’s videographic work is always so meticulous, and this playful, provocative, joyful, queer video essay is no exception. She invites us to imagine if all women in 1930s horror were queer and proceeds to deliver this fantasy of their sexual arousal. Circular cut-outs act like peepholes into scenes that focus our attention onto key characters and their (now) queer actions. With scalpel-like precision, she extracts individual words, sentences, gasps, and exclamations to construct sexy sound bites of female desire in the body of the piece. Lavender text spells out this dialogue over lush vintage wallpaper. Such a delight! Full disclosure: this video essay also appears in a special issue of Monstrum entitled Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, which I edited. Backlot Connections by John Gibbs With an Easter egg tucked behind every turn, this video essay links an array of (mainly) 1950s films through their shared use of the Universal backlot, connecting seemingly disparate characters, scenarios, and plots to ultimately reveal their similarities. Gibbs unobtrusively uses an onscreen subtitle track to narrate his observations and guide us through the same American town square again and again. He maps fictional spaces onto real, reused set pieces that live just beyond the Los Angeles River, weaving together stories that happened across fictions and temporalities to invite us into this endlessly recycled town. Meet Part | Mothers Daughters by Viktoria Paranyuk Moments of longing, intimacy, trauma, and loss are connected in this moving video essay by Viktoria Paranyuk. She puts Chantal Akerman’s Meetings with Anna in onscreen conversation with Lana Gogoberidze’s Some Interviews on Personal Matters, foregrounding the filmmakers’ personal lives, histories, and relationships with their mothers and how this has shaped their films. Paranyuk uses grids and feminist diptychs to engage both films and their makers, what Paranyuk calls “empathetic engagement” with incredible success. Video essayist (as kikikrazed) and community manager for The Essay Library For my selections, I chose to highlight videos that inspired me as both a creator and viewer of video essays. A Video About Everything Except This Monument Hidden in the Bushes by Dime Store Adventures Dime Store Adventures is, to me, the best storyteller on YouTube right now. This video sets out to document the process of researching a monument in Rhode Island, but it evolves several times. I appreciate how much he shares about his thought process as both a researcher and video creator. Each new discovery makes the video better because he welcomes them instead of trying to bend his sources to fit a certain conclusion. There’s a reveal at the 19 minute mark that made me pause the video and immediately save it to my list for this poll. SE7EN & How 35mm Scans Lie to You by WatchingtheAerial I love how WatchingtheAerial often includes an activity related to the topic of each video essay. In this case, for a video about fan-made film scans and remasters, he makes some scans of his own to get a personal look at the process. This essay does a great job of explaining technical information in a clear and concise way. He provides a nuanced take on the ongoing debate surrounding the accuracy of different scans and releases, with a fun twist at the end. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord There’s no shortage of online discussion about the Backrooms, but Kendra Gaylord still manages to find something new to say. It’s a surprisingly funny exploration of the real building behind the famous Backrooms photo, packed with tons of information about the architectural developments that have occurred over the room’s lifetime. Every time I rewatch this video I learn something new thanks to Kendra’s genuine interest in digging up niche information and sharing it with the world. With the release of the upcoming A24 film The Backrooms, the concept is evolving from a collaborative storytelling exercise to a profitable venture. The Backrooms are about to change forever, so I appreciate how Kendra takes the opportunity to highlight the real building and memories that started it all. Why You Should WANT To Cite Your Sources by Dime Store Adventures I’m mentioning Dime Store Adventures again because I think this video does a great job of highlighting what’s wrong with the way many people talk about plagiarism on YouTube. He argues that many creators cite their sources primarily to avoid being accused of plagiarism (a reoccurring scandal on the platform) instead of recognising the actual benefit that good citation practices have. This video should be required viewing for anyone incorporating research in their videos. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) “Humans call, and humans answer.” This essay itself is endlessly inspiring, but what I find especially motivating is the response it received. In the comments section I noticed that it was many viewers’ first introduction to the world of desktop documentaries – and they were so excited to discover the format! If you spend a lot of time releasing videos on YouTube, you start to feel weighed down by the pressure to ‘play it safe’ or risk losing favour in the eyes of the indecipherable algorithm. The response to this video essay proves that YouTube audiences have an appetite for more creativity and experimentation on the platform. Co-editor and co-founder, [in]Transition This list will largely consist of works published in [in]Transition given how much time and bandwidth viewing and reviewing submissions takes. Needless to say, I’m excited to see the selections of my colleagues and peers that will introduce me to pieces I missed given that blindspot. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar I had always imagined that it would be difficult to make a video essay analysing how sound functions in film given the medium’s skew towards visual information. Pavitra Sundar’s video On Listening challenged my own lack of imagination with its poetic exploration. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková There’s a running concern I tend to have about our field – that the texts videographic critics tend to privilege are canonical works by esteemed auteurs (I’m guilty of it too). In this context, Anger and Hanáková’s insightful exploration of the star wipe reminds us that serious analysis can account for the derided as well… sometimes even playfully. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse Alison Peirse showcases such an intuitive sense of rhythm and clip selection in her supercuts that it sometimes takes me multiple screenings to fully appreciate the argument they present because I’m so transfixed by their aesthetics. Crochet Is Sick!, like her previous work Knit One, Stab Two, continues her exploration of gender and the horror genre, but she finds significant deviations and fresh terrain here. Plus I always end up with a list of more horror flicks to check out by the end of her pieces, which is always a win. Film teacher and researcher at Escola das Artes in Católica University (O Porto); film programmer; film critic at À pala de Walsh website Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Maryam Tafakory’s essayistic cinema germinates from observation, a meticulous look at the past of her art, detecting images that remain to be made, imagined. However, it would be simpler to fill these gaps with parallel fictions. This is not her method: counter-imagination is filmed on the back of these very painful images, as if inviting the viewer to turn the past of Iranian cinema inside out and see new possibilities. In Daria’s Night Flowers, Tafakory ‘demands’ the images of oppressed and desperate women from post-revolution Iranian cinema to tell us about the possibility of an impossible queer love, and in this colourful, blossoming gesture, we are simultaneously seeing the prison bars and the freedom that the palimpsest points to. Kelly Reichardt’s Bestiario by Celia Sainz Celia Sainz is interested in exploring the notion of videographic ecocriticism, not only as thematic exploration but as an ontological gesture. Is the critical operation that acts directly on the structure of a film a way of revealing the fragility of the boundaries that insist on dividing things? Kelly Reichardt’s Bestiary is a three-part essay that operates this fragmentation within the American director’s body of work, but does so from a directional logic. To where do our eyes turn to? In the first segment, Birds Eye Views, we look up, where the life of birds challenges us in movement and sound. In the last segment, Ground Dog Day, we remain horizontal, close to the ground, in this communion on soil between humans (other beings) and dogs. In the middle of this gesture, No(Hu)Man’s Land, Sainz positions humans among other existences, revealing themselves among shots of segmented bodies that are becoming across the technological, the synthetic and the biological. In this case, videographic ecocriticism is a way to pierce through and connect the unconnected. Om Shanti Omnibus by International Video Essay Research Network (IVERN) In video essays, there is a ‘profane’ gesture towards the uniqueness and integrity of the work. Perhaps this premise makes videographic criticism an appropriate method for thinking about the decentering of authorial unity and the collaborative approach. Twelve members of the International Video Essay Research Network (IVERN) divided up a film they were unfamiliar with – Om Shanti Om (Farah Khan, 2007) – and, working on a specific segment, they had to obey specific parameters. The use of text on screen, voiceover, epigraph, multiscreen, superimposition, music/sound only from film, music/sound from external source, self-filmed footage (including desktop), footage from another source, repetition, unusual transitions and speed. The end result is fascinating: a cadavre exquis that is not just a compilation but a suggestion for mapping pedagogical possibilities in the teaching and practice of audiovisual essayism. The dissemination of perspectives on Khan’s film and the multiplication of digital impressions placed over the original give this exercise a true sense of decentralised criticism, of perspectives signed simultaneously from places of proximity, distance and collaboration. Hands Off, Eyes On by Donatella Della Ratta, R. Alessandro Turchioe, and Sofia Busquets Hands Off, Eyes On, by Donatella Della Ratta, R. Alessandro Turchioe and Sofia Busquets, is an intelligent video essay that exposes the tensions inherent in activism, in the distinction between the eye and the hand. Between visibility with transformative potential and the hypothetical limitations of that hand and the (im)possibility of art to have an immediately transformative impact. Hands Off, Eyes On takes a critical look at media, its reception, and the visibility market of festivals. Behind the screens, in their shadows, the films and words printed on the wall continue (contradict) the privileged space of cinema. Abbas Kiarostami: A Transversal Filmography by Cristian Tormo Cristian Tormo’s, Abbas Kiarostami: A Transversal Filmography brilliantly shows how a filmmaker can advance in his themes from film to film. The work expands, becomes more complex, branches out. The work grows up, like the characters in these films. Kiarostami is a key author for understanding the relationship between cinema and growing up, especially in the transition from childhood to adolescence. This video essay shows how, although the theme remains the same, the strategies for filming the problems of growing up change as the dilemmas transform and the world expands. Fading Echoes: Remembering and Forgetting through Videotapes by Vladimir Rosas-Salazar Nothing escapes deterioration. At the same time, everyone tries to resist it. Vladimir Rosas-Salazar uses home videos that his family recorded in the 1990s and 2000s in this video essay. Personal videos promised to build an archive as resistance to the loss of organic memory. Like with film. And as will probably happen with digital data. Rosas-Salazar uses the marks of the media, of its decay, its palimpsest, not only to suggest this fragility to us, but to reflect on the fallibility of memory. The imperfection of the media is perhaps the best match for the imperfection of memory: both recover, create and slowly fade away. The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning by João Araújo A brief editing exercise: hypnotic, simple, about to be lost. Of all the techniques that audiovisual essays can use, editing, as the beginning of a conversation with cinema, retains a mysterious form. In Araújo’s The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning, we glide through the fragility of the end of something that always restarts. The moving image of cinema symbolises this life, this fluidity, which lies between the elements, between the liquid and the weight of the fruit. In the midst of our gaze, everything falls, gravity is complete. But soon, everything rises again. It is the brilliance of cinema, which links causes, that makes death impermanent. As Marcus Aurelius wrote: “All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one.” YouTube-based video essayist Why Did UK Crisp Packets Swap Colours? by Chris Spargo While many people attribute Spargo’s meteoric rise in 2025 to the absence of household name Tom Scott, I think that’s doing him a bit of a disservice. He’s his own creator, in both personality and subject matter. Answering the question that you’ve always wondered, but been too afraid to ask, Why Did UK Crisp Packets Swap Colours? weaves a five-minute tale of corporate battles and tragedy, while also overlapping with the “Maths is blue instead of yellow” niche. There really is something for everyone here. Wacky History of Computer Scrabble by Junferno It’s easy to get distracted by Junferno from the Junferno YouTube Channel’s fast paced editing and deadpan humour without realising that you’re actually learning University-level Computer Science. Wacky History of Computer Scrabble is a dense dive into something that, on the surface, should be quite simple. It’s Scrabble, after all — you’ve played Scrabble, right? Yet, in between quips and jokes that you can only make sense of five seconds after he’s told them, you’ll learn that computers are really weird and Scrabble is really complicated and they also called one of the models for playing a word a “dawg”. That’s pretty funny. Games About Concrete by Puddle If we subscribe to the popular 2007 animated film Ratatouille’s idea of “a great chef can come from anywhere”, then Puddle’s Games About Concrete is proof that it can apply to the world of Video Essays as well. Sitting at a YouTube subscriber count of double digits, Puddle’s video is a both bleak and uplifting dive into a series of games about concrete and the sublime, harrowing, fantastical feelings they evoke. While many creators leave no stone unturned in their coverage, Puddle is not afraid to let the video breathe and to let the games speak for themselves, leaving the interpretation up to the viewer. PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Lily Alexandre’s work has maintained a reliable spot on my list since 2023, and this year was no different. Trans Day of Vanishing is a chilling (literally, in some shots), haunting, incisive reflection on contemporary trans visibility, and it’s one of her best videos to date. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Written and delivered by Big Joel and animated delightfully by Mothcub, this video isn’t really about mousetraps or YouTube, but it’s also about both? Or possibly neither. Either way, I found it terrifying and wonderful. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis I suspect that I won’t be the only person to put this rare ‘Lindsay Ellis returns to YouTube’ video on my list, so I won’t belabor the point with a woefully incomplete description or justification. This video made me laugh, and cry, and cry, and cry, and it is worth watching again. Academic filmmaker and Associate Professor of film and media at Aarhus University My impression is that the scholarly video essay in 2026 has achieved something like self-assurance. Perhaps institutional recognition of video essay practice has become more established; certainly, some of the innovations of the past 15 years have been integrated and even somewhat routinised. Catherine Grant’s influence seems to me pervasive, particularly the example of her epigraphic work and deployment of soft montage. Grant’s own videos made with collaborators this year – Pausas/Pauses with Rachel Randall, and Making Fiction Flow with Melanie Bell – and the response she made for a collection of video essays edited by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper (ASAP Review, December 2024), are themselves magisterial consolidation of the rhetoric Grant has evolved over a decade and a half. I would place such works in a strand of videographic criticism that suggests the form is uniquely equipped for the reflexive activation of the archive, a strand that stretches from videos like Between Magic and Realism from Kathleen Loock’s Hollywood Memories project, through John Gibbs’ Backlot Connections, to Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková’s The Return of the Star Wipe and Mathias Bonde Korsgaard’s The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds. The ambition of such work also begins to suggest the capacity of videographic criticism to devote sustained attention to themes and phenomena. The two volumes published so far in the Lever Press videographic book series – Jason Mittell on Breaking Bad and Gregory Brophy and Shawn Malley on contemporary science fiction – are the standouts here, of course. (Interestingly, both programmatically employ a range of videographic modes, suggesting that videographic criticism per se is as core a concern as the declared topics.) Series like Johannes Binotto’s Gestures of Thought (among them the uncanny Swallow) and Alison Peirse’s supercut treatments of horror cinema (for example, Crochet Is Sick!) also prove the cumulative power of analysis across multiple videos. Conversely, Christian Keathley’s teasing and complex one-hour Cinephilia and History is a single but monograph-equivalent video essay that demonstrates the intellectual sophistication of which videographic criticism is capable. It also represents an alternative mode of videographic work that foregrounds the body of the maker, albeit in a very different register from that of Dayna McLeod, the preeminent practitioner in this ‘somatic’ mode (see Potbelly). McLeod refers to herself as a ‘performance artist’; I think we need the term ‘performance academic’ to capture the distinctiveness of some of the work being produced. I mention all these essayists and strands they represent because the richness and quantity of work in the field makes choosing ever harder for the purpose of this poll. My ‘official’ selection below expresses my sense of the self-assurance and consolidation in scholarly videographic criticism mentioned above. But it also appreciates the continued experimentation with the video essay form that, I’m glad to say, frustrates the synthesising impulse motivating this introductory paragraph. Contemptuous Chess: A Moving Poem by Drew Morton Contemptuous Chess is a contribution to Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems project, in which makers are invited to pair “a single poem or multiple poems […] with a single or multiple moving-image media text(s) […]”. Morton puts three texts into dialogue: Alberto Moravia’s novel Il disprezzo (Contempt, 1954), about a playwright who reluctantly adapts The Odyssey for the screen, Godard’s film adaptation of that novel, Le Mépris (Contempt, 1963), and Rosario Castellanos’s poem Chess (1972). The result is a masterclass in pacing, on-screen text, and the orchestration of voices, other sound and music. With readings of Castellanos’s poem in four languages, it applies the lessons of Barbara Zecchi’s thinking on the ‘accented video essay’ and presents adaptation itself as an accented practice. Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú I thought Joel Burges and Allison Cooper’s cluster of video essays entitled The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias was extremely well conceived and produced (full disclosure: I was invited – and delighted – to compose a video response). Among the uniformly superb videos in the collection, I think I have watched most often Catalina Segú’s Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place, which deals with the personal and cultural legacies of the Chilean dictatorship. This formally and thematically ambitious video essay reveals new connections with each viewing, and I use it regularly now in class to show how complexity and ambivalence can be managed and enacted as videographic thought. The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar I think Ariel Avissar won’t mind if I describe The ParAlax View as the ugliest video essay of 2025. It’s also one of the year’s most intellectually intriguing. The video is a shot-for-shot AI remake of the ‘brainwashing montage’ from Alan J. Pakula’s The Parallax View (1974) in which the original images are replaced by slop approximations generated by Picsart, themselves based on prompts elicited from ChatGPT. Avissar also composes the creator statement in iterative and avowed collaboration with ChatGPT, and includes interpolations from an unnamed peer reviewer. The combination of video essay and unstably authored text self-consciously takes forward videographic criticism as a distributed and cyborg scholarly practice. Sound Stack, Soundwalk, Southworth by Cormac Donnelly I may be cheating by nominating Cormac Donnelly’s Sound Stack, Soundwalk, Southworth. This is not a single video essay but a portfolio of three videos containing a video analysis of a soundscape in Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007), a methodological tutorial on imaging techniques borrowed from Kevin Ferguson, and the recording of a soundwalk Donnelly took through Boston, for a total of 134 minutes. As with Ariel Avissar’s video and statement, Donnelly’s portfolio insists on videographic scholarship as a distributed and compound practice, and argues against conceptions of the video essay as an autonomous or self-contained form. I’m delighted to see Donnelly picking up the idea of ‘luxury scholarship’, in which making and method are indulged for their own sake. At the same time, Donnelly’s challenge to the ‘visual prejudice’ in film studies salutarily reprises a strand of important work by the great Liz Greene, and resonates with recent work on sound by scholar-makers like Pavitra Sundar (On Listening) and Annalisa Pellino (the forthcoming Becoming-Voice). Object Oriented Breaking Bad by Jason Mittell I take advantage of the publication in late 2024 of Jason Mittell’s videographic book, The Chemistry of Character in Breaking Bad, to nominate a video essay that has circulated for some years. I think Object Oriented Breaking Bad is a key work in the field. It shows how deformative methods can analytically grasp aspects of long-form texts hidden in plain sight, surfacing textures of world-building and the more-than-human. It suggests the potential for videographic practice to allow non-human entities to ‘speak’ in what we can imagine with Bruno Latour as a ‘Parliament of Things’ – a forum in which objects and ecologies find political representation alongside citizens and societies. An Accented Video Way of Thinking: Becoming videoessay by Barbara Zecchi Drawing on thinkers like Deleuze and Hamid Naficy, and on theories of the accent as a mode of thought rather than just speech, Barbara Zecchi’s meta-video contrasts the ‘videoessay’ (she insists on the single word), as an ‘accented’ form of criticism, with traditional, purportedly ‘accent-less’ scholarship. This is playful but challenging work: I may even have overheard Prof. Zecchi suggest that, on rewatching the videoessay, she found she couldn’t quite follow it, despite having made it herself. This is as it should be. Please don’t mention this to Prof. Zecchi, but I prefer this mode in her work to the more crowd-pleasing and easily legible achievement of a video like The Rhythms of Rage. The work we do should exceed and elude us. ‘Predictable Unpredictability’– Dynamic Embodied Patterns in Miklós Jancsó’s Film Style by Miklós Kiss and Maarten Coëgnarts Miklós Kiss and Maarten Coëgnarts would certainly disagree with what I have just written. Miklós Kiss has been resolute in arguing the distinction between videographic research method and communication mode, and has insisted on the need to be ‘clear’ in scholarly video essays. Accordingly, Predictable Unpredictability is exemplary in its explanatory clarity. Kiss and Coëgnarts show how complex frame and figure movement in Miklós Jancsó, hard to grasp by traditional analytical means, can be captured and analysed by merging animated diagrams and film extracts. In working audiovisually to offer a precise account of an aspect of Jancsó’s style, Kiss and Coëgnarts have expanded the rhetoric and capacities of videographic criticism. Video essayists and political activists We try to avoid hierarchies so this exercise was a challenge. We picked essays which each exemplified a different aspect of the artform. Doubtlessly, there are other equally beautiful essays from this year, but these are the ones that stuck with us. The Alt-Right Playbook: The South Bank of the Rubicon by Innuendo Studios For years now, Innuendo Studios has put out videos starting with a hypothetical, “Say, for the sake of argument”. This video, apparently the last in the series, does not start that way. Instead it starts with gentle sound design, and an unexpected introduction. This essay is a plea, and it will be a time capsule. It asks the audience to take stock in the moment they’re in, as they watch a dark history unfold. It makes salient the emotional turmoil of experiencing politics, with an eerily gentle tone. Fascists Will Waste Your Time. by Thought Slime Thought Slime uses comedy to be very clear, and uses clarity to be shatteringly funny. As with most of their videos, the tone is intentionally unpretentious. Thought Slime puts forth an argument about the best way to speak to unapologetic fascists, which is not to speak to them at all. Behind her humour is unimpeachable logic, and Mildred’s persona is thoroughly enjoyable company, even with what should be a grim topic. DIY HRT: Everything I Can Legally Tell You by Lily Alexandre This video is praxis; and not in some fuzzy sense in which art inspires revolutions, but in the simple and straightforward sense that the work itself will tangibly help people. We would not be surprised to see other works from Lily on this list, and comparatively this work may seem somewhat unassuming. But it is the work we have forwarded to people who are in desperate positions, having to manage their own healthcare. There is real bravery in using a platform like YouTube to spread information to marginalised people, and Lily does so with her usual mastery of the medium. Brat and the Culture of Addiction by Alexander Avila An Alexander Avila video sometimes feels like taking an interesting philosophy class, complete with pop culture references, swish lighting, perfect music and sprinkles of queer innuendo. This video in particular showcases Alex’s ability to compose a narrative with a dizzying array of elements. He takes real risks. At one point in his piece, Alex breaks all the rules of YouTube and filmmaking and addresses the audience directly in a pointed staring contest. Not just anticipating the audience’s discomfort, but triggering it intentionally, watching you with folded arms as time passes. Much of the video feels uncomfortable, and yet it’s a work we’ve watched more than once. For such a demonstration of virtuosity it also has such heart. The ‘War’ in Gaza Is Not Really Taking Place by chriswaves Chriswaves is the mercurial personification of internet culture; he has emerged as one of the most unique and insightful voices covering the intersection of technology, alienation, and capitalist exploitation. His work is slick, catchy, and meticulously edited. In this essay, he applies Jean Baudrillard’s and Achille Mbembe’s work to the conflict in Gaza, and highlights the throughline from small acts of capitalistic exploitation to terrifying state violence. It’s haunting without being voyeuristic, academic while still feeling urgent. And most importantly, it somehow ends on a plea for hope. Chris’s work is both innovative and familiar, a reminder of what is uniquely good about this genre. Video essayist, community manager for the Essay Library, Yu-Gi-Oh player Being a manager for the Essay Library, a Discord server for up-and-coming video essayists, I tend to come into contact with a lot of video essays from… up-and-coming video essayists. It’s wonderful to see the payoff for videos when I’ve seen firsthand the amount of work that has gone into them, and the source of various artistic choices taken in their creation. My submissions include some highlights of those from this year. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) Rarely do you come across a video that makes you feel the kind of joy you get from just being a human. This video from Josh showcases this joy in one of its most basic forms: communication. He refutes the value of AI writing from the idea that the purpose of writing is to meet with another person, and reflects the personal side of this issue by drawing upon his experiences with his friends and as an English professor to back up his points. This essay is both deeply intimate and extremely relevant to an important issue impacting our cultural landscape. Storytime Animation Doesn’t Feel Relatable Anymore by comma splice This first video from comma splice explores the transformation of the YouTube genre of storytime animation. These videos usually reflect on one’s lived experience – they tend to change quite a bit in style and substance as their creators grow from hobbyists to the owners of small production companies. Though comma splice’s essay functions as a critique, it comes from a place of love for the genre, and it can easily be seen in their self-made avatar which meshes wonderfully with the style of the videos they critique. I hope to see more of their work in the future. Change-Makers: Opposing Fascism In Daily Life by Afterthoughts This is one of a couple of videos in a series by Afterthoughts, which seeks to showcase actionable goals people strive for when trying to resist the current political landscape. A common critique of leftist video essays is that while they often seek to inform people of issues in society, they don’t often provide a guide for solving the problem. Change-Makers has this missing information in spades, tackling tactics like civil disobedience or protesting often through the lens of three different archetypes of activist that they define. This information is something that I think many people sorely need at the moment, and Afterthoughts is doing a fantastic job at presenting it! How to Reduce Salt by Core-A GamingMy favourite aspect of Core-A Gaming is that while his videos are incredibly applicable to his chosen subject of fighting games, they usually extend to the general mindset approaching competition. In this video, he examines techniques used in cognitive behavioral therapy to create a healthier mindset towards approaching competition, which is an issue that many people struggle with from my own experience. I love the way he incorporates interviews he conducts with top players from various games to back up his points, easily bridging the gap from theoretical to practical. Professor of Film Studies, University of Leeds Videographic criticism is feeling its archival fantasy in 2025. Check out Ellen Nolan’s The Nita Harvey Archive for Screenworks, Amanda Doxtater’s Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement in ASAP-Review, Viktoria Paranyuk’s Meet Part | Mothers Daughters in Apparatus, and the wonderful Movie dossier Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive. I remain, as ever, obsessed with archives, film history, and feelings. This (magnificent) obsession is evidenced with great beauty and clarity in the work I have selected: Zodiac Killer Project by Charlie Shackleton when the archive denies your desires AGENCIA by May Santiago when the archive cannot hold you Okay Keskidee! Let Me See Inside by Rhea Storr when film builds new archives They’re Just Hands! by Dayna McLeod when film is reimagined as an archive of love Video essayist You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) There are many videos dissecting the numerous problems with AI but none have inspired me to be a better human and friend like this thoughtful exploration of communication and art. be your own algorithm by pagemelt A rare criticism of algorithms that keeps its critique aimed where it belongs while being a love letter to humanity and art in ways that are often dismissed in other critiques of our online spaces controlled by corporations. I Saw the TV Glow: CRT Memories and Fuzzy Genders by AdequateEmily A masterful analysis that weaves in the personal from herself and other trans people to poignantly touch on why this film had such an impact for many of us, myself included. WARFRAME 1999 is Absurdly Punk Rock by SocraTetris I found myself loving a game that I knew nearly nothing about going in. A thoughtful examination of what a piece of art has to say when we consider its cultural context in a moment in time with an emphatically punk rock conclusion. What I Learned Photographing NPCs in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth by SolidArf A beautiful exploration of the little details in massive AAA games through a lens of his love of photography which brings appreciation to elements of the art form often overlooked. How Galileo Broke the Scientific Method by Dr Fatima An ideological breakdown of how science itself is often discussed and perceived gives us much to think about how we go about acquiring knowledge. Dr Fatima’s end of video discussions are also a welcome addition that not only build on her points but something we rarely see on YouTube. Sinners and the Death of Black Art by F.D. Signifier Manages to take a beloved piece of media and uses it to interrogate a double consciousness that exists when creating media within systems that are antagonistic to those making the media. Video essayist on YouTube Regrettably, this selection is limited to the YouTube video essay sphere, as I’m not familiar enough with the wider landscape to be much use beyond it. That being said, I’m very happy to share some of the great video work I’ve been fortunate enough to see on that platform this year! We’ve forgotten how to forget. by josh (with parentheses) This one flew way under the radar. Josh’s piece goes down an elegantly presented and deeply compelling rabbit hole, starting with a few confusing frames of 1995’s A Goofy Movie, moving through questions of medium, cartography, and even Disney lore, ending on a recognition of what we’ve lost as online viewers – the ability “to love a thing and let it go”. Scratch the surface, and many of our present moment’s distressing realities feel like knock-on effects of this principle, of the way the internet lets any discussion carry on, intensify, and ferment forever. The alt-right wouldn’t have formed if they’d had to GamerGate in person. There’d be no basilisks or longtermism addling the minds in charge of our economies had LessWrong been a coffee shop. This essay isn’t about either of those things – it’s about a weird map in A Goofy Movie! – but our journey down that rabbit hole is very much situated in the concerns of 2025. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Is this even a video essay? Is it a visual poem, instead? What’s the difference? I’m not sure. Whatever this is, Big Joel has produced an obliquely evocative video that examines cruelty, interpersonal boundaries, the intimacy of viewing, the way every surface on a platform like YouTube is, in some way, a slippery slope. This one rewards repeat viewings, and is gorgeously animated by mothcub. Fantasies of Nuremberg by Jacob Geller How do you make video essays while the world is falling apart? It’s a question many prominent creators in this space have wrestled with in recent times. Some answers have been better than others. From a formal perspective, Fantasies of Nuremberg is a more straightforward essay than many of Geller’s, except when it’s not. It takes the viewer along in a journey from despair, to confusion, to rage, and back again. Revenge is too much, and not enough. Justice is elusive. This is a knotty essay. The knots remain largely intact at its end, but handling them together for 40 or so minutes does result in a sort of affirmation. The Ten Traits of Slop Content by Ro Ramdin This is, as one YouTube commenter puts it, “A very thorough thesis on stuff that kinda evades thoroughness.” Slop is one of those terms that came out of nowhere and shot straight into the dominant vocabulary of the internet. For the past year or so, it’s been very hard to talk online about art or content without having to contend with this word in some way. Many of us have attempted to define what people are trying to convey with the term, and most of us have failed. Not Ro Ramdin. By avoiding direct definition and instead lasering in on the ways we talk about slop, the voices leading that conversation, and the social, cultural and technological contexts we’re doing slop ‘discourse’ within, Ramdin takes us right to its heart. It’s an uneasy, sickly sweet journey. Are Americans Irish? by The Leftist Cooks There are very few essayists I’ll drop whatever I’m doing to catch up on. The Leftist Cooks are among that number, and this essay is a great example of why. Honestly, all their essays are – I could have picked any of their releases from the past 12 months here. Neilly and Sarah are masters of the long-form video essay. It’s not easy to dive as deep into a question as the pair do here while keeping that exploration fresh, thought-provoking, and authentic (trust me, I’ve tried). Are Americans Irish? does all this and more, zooming through history, film, politics, philosophy, and personal experience to end up interrogating the very idea of identity. Head of Film Programming & Distribution, Eye Filmmuseum Dracula by Radu Jude Outrageous essay film on AI, the bloodsucker of our times. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Pretty sure I picked a film by Maryam Tafakory every time I participated in this poll. Masterful as always. Remembering Otherwise by belit sağ A performative reading in the cinema inviting the audience to analyse the same few seconds of footage in different ways, based on a broader project on a 1978 labour strike in Veghel, the Netherlands, led by Turkish migrant women. happiness by Fırat Yücel Ancestral Visions of the Future by Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph Audiovisual PhD student and Film & TV Placement Coordinator at the University of Birmingham In no particular order, these all made it onto a handy notepad this year, under the heading ’video essays to watch again’. Enjoy! Backlot Connections by John Gibbs As an actor plays different parts, so the backlot portrays different places, yet fundamentally remains itself. A fascinating study of how seemingly separate narratives and characters’ lives converge on and around the Universal Backlot. Arkiv Avis Mor (Archive Newspaper Mother) by Marie Hallager Andersen I found this utterly captivating and original. Marie Hallager Andersen weaves together a whale, old newspaper, home videos, dance performances, projection, questions about archives and bodies, and so much more. Beautiful storytelling that ruminates on motherhood, memory and movement. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková Meticulously researched, so fun to watch and a perfectly realised retro aesthetic throughout that is anything but gimmicky in its execution. <applause> Lost in Grand Central by Joel Blackledge Clever interplay of text and image showcases the incongruity between Hollywood superstars and a British city widely denigrated for its looks, as well as the confusion many have experienced in and around Birmingham New Street Station and Grand Central shopping centre. I wish I’d made this! Mapping Roma by Jessica Wax-Edwards An embodied exploration into the filming locations of Roma which uses superimposition to great effect, highlighting the complexities of representing ‘real’ places on screen, both past and present, and how film location tourists may experience them. Filler Words by Ian Garwood Entertaining and subtly provocative, this certainly gave me ‘pause for thought’. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse So well crafted (excuse the pun), I can’t look at crocheted blankets or shawls in any screen context now without wondering what impending horrors may await. Building on her previous video essay ‘Knit One, Stab Two’ – though this also works strongly as a standalone piece – Alison Peirse champions the crucial work of the Art Department and Wardrobe. Freelance critic, former associate editor for documentary at Hyperallergic Henry Fonda for President by Alexander Horwath The best theatrically released essay film I’ve seen this year. Henry Fonda, it turns out, works very well as both a metonym and a contrast with America and its history. Everyone Is Cheating at Chess (Allegedly) by Sarah Z Extremely fun and funny video about people going to extremes to cheat, which also is a useful look at how changing technology and social mores have caused the storied strategy game’s meta, social role, and psychogeographic environment to evolve. Why Movies Just Don’t Feel ‘Real’ Anymore by Like Stories of Old There’s been a lot of discourse about digital sheen and changing production models and how it’s affected cinema aesthetics. This, more than any other video or single article, works perfectly as a succinct way to explain to those who might not get it just what we’re talking about. The Wizard of Oz at Sphere Is Nightmare Fuel by Be Kind Rewind ChatGPT Made Me Delusional by Eddy Burback Disney’s Living Characters: A Broken Promise by Defunctland Video essayist and PhD How to Spot a Bad Critic by Accented Cinema The rise of independent creators on online platforms like YouTube has, for all its benefits, also led to a collapse in quality control. Virtually anyone can upload a video of insubstantial analysis or bad-faith criticism and call it a video essay. How to Spot a Bad Critic offers a useful framework for viewers to recognise poor criticism when they see it. It is also a good video for fellow essayists, a standard for us to hold ourselves to. Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Biopic You’re Not Allowed to See… by Be Kind Rewind Be Kind Rewind’s recounting of Superstar’s production, legacy, and legal troubles would be worthy of consideration on the strength of its writing and research alone, but it’s the videomaking which makes the work transcendent. Just as Todd Haynes used Barbie dolls to re-enact the life story of Karen Carpenter, so too does Isabel Custodio use Barbie dolls to tell the story of Haynes and his film. Formally ambitious and substantial. How David Lynch Saw the Bright Side by Broey Deschanel Doubling as a thoughtful analysis of David Lynch’s artistry and a moving tribute to a much beloved filmmaker, Deschanel’s video essay explores familiar aspects of Lynch’s work to arrive at an unexpected and underdiscussed conclusion. How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard Most of The Elephant Graveyard’s video work has been dedicated to critiquing the modern comedy sphere dominated by Joe Rogan and his expanded circle. This video is his magnum opus. A damning portrait of how thoroughly MAGA politics and its figureheads have infiltrated pop culture through the guise of comedy that is also far funnier than any of the so-called comedians highlighted. Why the Terminator Uses a Phone Book by Jesse Tribble In an era of multi-hour deep dives, it’s refreshing to see a video essayist tackle something so small and seemingly inconsequential. In just under five minutes, Jesse offers a compelling read of the phone book as plot device in The Terminator, incorporating the conventions of genre cinema and even the history of the telephone itself in his analysis. PragerU’s Terrible Shakespeare Opinions, or Why I Stopped Talking About Shakespeare by Kyle Kallgren Stunning. More than just a cutting retort to PragerU’s bigotry and anti-intellectualism, this video essay thoroughly dismantles the notion that any artwork or artist can truly transcend the political and material realities in which they exist. Kyle Kallgren has since announced his retirement from videomaking on YouTube and this swan song is a reminder of how vital he’s been to the medium. Witty, rigorously researched, and willing to sit within uncomfortable complexities, this is an essential video essay. modern masculinity and The Critical Drinker by Man Carrying Thing Videos critiquing/debunking the bad film analysis of rage-bait YouTubers like The Critical Drinker have become a popular sub-genre on Film YouTube in recent years. But Man Carrying Thing zeroes in on a less-often discussed aspect of such channels: their appallingly lazy video editing. Video editor and podcast host How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard In-depth verbal evisceration of Rogan and his orbiters. What Are ‘White People Tacos’? by Internet Shaquille Direct, succinct, funny, and insightful video about white people tacos and how they differ from their traditional Mexican counterparts. The Labubu Chronicles by Ro Ramdin Cultural commentary, poem, and opulent visual art feast all in one. ChatGPT Made Me Delusional by Eddy Burback What better way to demonstrate ChatGPT’s corrosive mental effects than to present it with one foundational delusion that it then runs with and builds upon to an astonishing degree? Filmmaker, author, video essayist I’ve never needed new ways of thinking than I do now. I live in hope for the next generation, that we may yet find the Godard of video essays Spectateurs! by Arnaud Desplechin Everything an essay should be: personal, beautiful, thoughtful, and Mathieu Amalric shows up. Disney’s Animatronics: A Living History by Kevin Perjurer Nothing like getting enchanted by a Defunctland piece I Fell in Love with a Quebec Reality Dating Show by Derin Emre Spritely and openhearted The Queen is Dead: Trans, Queer, and Femme Image in Last Exit to Brooklyn by Willow Maclay and Kat Ellinger A great probing look at a history still being discovered The Purplettes: The Room Next Door by Green and Red A lovely cubist deconstruction of a work that flows so effortlessly past its details. Making us better understand how an artist tells a story of death’s complications. Video essayist and independent scholar Breaking The Creepy AI in Police Cameras by Benn Jordan I asked the question “What is Cinema?” a lot this year. The primary site of screen reception is no longer the theatre or even the television, but rather everywhere else there’s a screen – phones, ATMs, rear-facing cameras on your car. Cinema is everywhere and nowhere. But more importantly, the camera itself no longer primarily resides in Hollywood or TV studios or even in your pocket, but in the vast array of always-on surveillance systems blanketing corporate and government buildings, roadsides, and doorbells, outfitted with licence plate readers and facial recognition AI, and piping all that visual and telemetric data into the hard drives of police, ICE, and privately-owned data brokers. What is cinema? Nowadays, it’s the surveillance grid. And so if we’re going to make meaningful video essays about seeing-knowledge-power in the world today, they’d better be interventions into that surveillance grid. And NO ONE this year has more meaningfully intervened on that apparatus than Benn Jordan, who EXPOSED the whole data collection system and BROKE the licence-plate-reading functionality on Flock Safety cameras in this video, then followed up by HACKING the entire 80,000-camera grid here. Everything else this year takes a back seat. The Rehearsal Season 2, Episode 3 ‘Pilot’s Code’, minutes 21 through 31 by Nathan Fielder Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal Season 2 might be the most multi-modal piece of media ever made. It’s so multi-modal that for 10 minutes in episode 3, he shifts into full-YouTuber fan-theory video-essay mode – but with two important twists. One: unlike the eisegetical crackpot nonsense that pollutes most of YouTube, I’m absolutely sold on Fielder’s Evanescence Hypothesis. Two: all of his corkboard-diagramming and cockpit-voice-recorder-timing are in the service of something beautiful: empathy for the private struggle of a public individual and the mental health epidemic hiding in plain sight behind it. All the jokes are serious, and that’s surpassingly rare and precious. Orwell: 2+2=5 by Raoul Peck While this film seems historically fated to not land with the urgency of Peck’s I Am Not Your Negro, that’s a shame – because the breadth of research, the adroit connections it makes to the present, and its empathy for Orwell’s life story are in all ways the equal of that great earlier work. Just when you think it’s only about propaganda and social control, it becomes about surveillance, AI (“The imagination will not breed in captivity” – Orwell), revolution, love, morality, and everything else that matters. This one speaks for itself. Panorama of Western State Penitentiary by Eli Jacob Boonin-Vail The best video essays exist at the junction of some set of concerns you didn’t previously realise intersected. This compact and impactful academic piece sits at the crossroads of contemporary film production, carceral technologies, media archaeology, and much more. What does it mean for a jail to be ‘well designed’? Why would we ever be happy to look at one? And yet from early cinema to the present we haven’t been able to stop aestheticising them. A worthwhile study, and maybe even a wake-up call. Why ChatGPT Can’t Draw a Full Glass of Wine by Alex O’Connor The best rumination on AI this year was Josh Geist’s You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.), but since I recognised him for his video on Winnie the Pooh and Candide a few years ago (still incredible!), this video offers another path through AI. From a simple question, posed in the title, Alex finds a new way to examine empiricism and potentially kickstart hundreds of Philosophy 101 discussions that haven’t been interesting to students in decades. I Solved Klotski by 2swap As a species, we went all-in on the eye. There’s almost no way we can meaningfully understand a set of numbers or the operation of a complex system directly. We have to invent a way to visualise it. I wish more video essayists started with that fundamental task: to find a new way to visualise something. It makes my year when someone makes something this jaw-droppingly gorgeous. What If We Made a Camera That Sees in Reverse? by Stuff Made Here For my final slot this year, I just want to shout-out all the ‘f*ck-around-and-find-out’ YouTubers who are still finding new ways of seeing things. Like Lensevision and his geometric camera filter experiments, Patrick Gillespie repeatedly blurring and sharpening an image, or, most amazingly, this video’s spinning camera rig that sees in unwrapped? reverse? perspective? behind things? … You really just have to see for yourself. Photography began with engineering. And it can be reborn every time an engineer decides to start from scratch again. It’s beautiful. Managing editor of Found Footage Magazine This 2025 short-list obviously fails to capture the full scope of the video essays that make critical use of found footage or pre-existing images. And the last year has brought an exceptional number of remarkable works. The titles highlighted here represent just one attempt to recognise video essays that engage meaningfully with the world around us. They tackle with creativity and courage global concerns such as the Palestinian conflict, racism, housing affordability, cultural heritage, collective identity or the inevitable ways in which mankind and technology interact. I hope this selection is a reminder of what we cannot miss. Another Other by Bex Oluwatoyin Thompson In a moment marked by fierce political polarization, a film like Another Other poses a lot of thought-provoking questions about profound social crisis and the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society. Houses We Can Own by Susana Bessa A fascination with the way houses are depicted in the movies becomes a video essay that reflects on how the environments we occupy influence personal experiences, beliefs and achievements. Houses We Can Own is a video essay which considers how architecture and spatial environments shape our identities and the narratives we build around our lives. The Sorrow of the Lynx by Michaela Grill Contemporary art plays an essential role in confronting the climate emergency. Michaela Grill’s The Sorrow of the Lynx delves into the natural world of Siberia to explore how this expansive ecosystem is being transformed by the growing pressures of global warming and man-made disasters, from widespread woodland fires to other environmental disruptions. Human Movie: Six Meditations on a Compression Algorithm by Eryk Salvaggio Blending glitched AI-generated imagery with archival images, Eryk Salvaggio’s work sheds light on how cognitive processes are simulated, onto how human consciousness is being emulated and imprisoned in today’s modern digital landscape. The Force by Wilma Stone I particularly like The Force. Wilma Stone’s video essay, while grounded in scholarship, is fully compatible with a work process that embraces a poetic approach to the archive to tell how colonial histories erase local knowledge, heritage, and identity. Film curator/Film studies PhD candidate (University of St Andrews) A mix of works I’m grateful to have discovered this year, including some unorthodox choices that share the critical and formal sensibilities at work in the liveliest and most perceptive video essays, and that perhaps hint at promising directions for the form. Flesh & Ghost by Sky Hopinka A transporting film of ghosts, flesh and echoes, which like many of Hopinka’s works, offers ways to feel for all that shimmers at the limits of knowing. A looped two-channel video, alive with the music of Courtney Asztalos, it approaches cycles of loss and return, grief and gratitude, through a Hočąk story, VHS tapes from Hopinka’s youth, and the shifting motions of poetry, myth, and memory. just above the tear duct on each side by Cat and Éiméar McClay Fragmenting texts found in the archival materials of the defunct St. Conal’s Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny, this singular work looks closely behind the harrowing statistic that during the 1950s, Ireland had the highest rate of psychiatric hospital use in the world. The imbrications of colonial and carceral logics with local social and religious dynamics interact with staggering force with the quiet, animated digital renditions of the dilapidated, life-crushing spaces that once housed them. Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú A vivid and affecting work about the interplay of sensing and being sensed by places, tracing the shifting limits of control when retrieving certain memories, where mechanisms of forgetting are dissolved and undone by the flesh. Through an exquisite sense of pace, the video essay gathers footage from Segú’s family video archives, military marches and parades from the Chilean dictatorship, TV shows, and a sensitive return to scenes from Lucrecia Martel’s films. Like the gesture it circles – a child jumping in a swimming pool without hesitation, Segú’s own, echoed in La cienega – the work moves between the surface and depths of personal and collective experiences, which shape the body. အသွင်ပြောင်းလဲမှုတစ်ခု/A Metamorphosis by Lin Htet Aung A restructuring of state television propaganda from Myanmar’s dictatorship into a formally exciting and unsettling broadcast. The work tends towards playful abstraction, where the official colours of the national flag interact with other colours that allude to new possibilities. Familiar language and images are retuned as elusive visuals and unnerving lullabies (using AI trained on the voice of the military dictator), which eschew footage of protests and state violence but retain an affective texture attuned to both the subtle and blatant workings of propaganda. A Brief History of Chasing Storms by Curtis Miller The tornado as destructive weather, visual icon, a thrilling and tragic event, linked to climate change, disaster capitalism, and mythologies of American film culture. A tactile and expansive work that balances memorable anecdotes with a range of archival materials. It organises stories teased from repeated journeys across the ‘Tornado Alley’ of the American Midwest into discrete episodes, while inviting sound to carry the work in open and surprising ways, engaging the iconic imagery of tornadoes and the anxieties and imaginaries they evoke with generous, critical, and moving depth. Artist, filmmaker and PhD student at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Brno University of Technology – VUT) Confession: This year, I haven’t seen nearly as many video essays as I used to. For this reason, my selection is eclectic and personal. It is not meant to be a selection of the so-called objectively best, but rather of what won me over the moment I encountered it. How Not to Remember Our Bodies by Lucie Rosenfeldová An impressive deconstruction of historical materials, supplemented by the author’s photographs, animations, and visualizations, deals with women’s reproductive rights in socialist Czechoslovakia. Unspectacular, but all the more disturbing and uncompromising. It raises fundamental questions about the autonomy of the female body in relation to bureaucracy and patriarchy. “What is ‘we’ when we say ‘ours’?” How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard An answer to the question: Why did comedy get so shitty? Together with the creator of The Elephant Graveyard, you can dive into a deep rabbit hole where you will explore everything that the manosphere, Roganosphere, toxicity, alt-right, conspirituality, and the cult practices of charismatic but stupid leaders mean. You will see the world behind the mirror, as described by Naomi Klein in her book Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World. Towards Eremos: Form, Emptiness, Posthumanism by Jáchym Šidlák The video essay attempts to describe the viewer’s experience of watching a film that seeks to adopt a posthumanist and more-than-human perspective. This is a difficult task on both levels. Judge for yourself how well it succeeds. Or rather, experience it for yourself. Head of the University of Massachusetts Film Studies Program The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar Ariel Avissar is one of the most inventive and transformative video­essayists working today. (I could fill my entire poll with works by Ariel Avissar.) With This Is Not What I Normally Do he had already pushed the form into territories that felt unprecedented – often with conceptual audacity. The ParAIax View marks yet another leap forward. Here, Avissar invites AI systems to reimagine the notorious brainwashing montage from The Parallax View (1974), not as a simple remake but as a probing test of what happens when machinic hallucination encounters one of cinema’s most disturbing political visions. The result is quite mesmerising, revealing new tensions, distortions, and interpretive slippages that emerge when human intention meets algorithmic generation. And of course, this comes on the heels of his spectacular earlier Parallax View Piece (Laird’s Constraint) (forthcoming in Screenworks). See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird Colleen Laird’s first video essay Eye–Camera–Ninagawa was an absolute virtuoso deconstruction of the opening montage of Ninagawa’s Helter Skelter – so dazzling in its precision, originality, and skill that one might have thought it her opera maestra. We were not surprised by the string of similarly commanding works following it (she is such a brilliant videoessayist), yet it was hard to believe she could surpass it. And yet her latest video essay, See Under: Orient, goes beyond everything one could have anticipated. It is a work of breathtaking beauty and brilliance: a seamless fusion of sound, rhythm, and colour, carried by a theoretical sophistication that never weighs down its sensorial force. The piece marks a new pinnacle in Laird’s already extraordinary videographic practice – and one can only imagine that even greater achievements lie ahead. Pausas\Pauses by Rachel Randall and Catherine Grant Pausas/Pauses is a beautiful exploration of a gesture that recurs across contemporary Latin American cinema yet often slips past critical attention: the fleeting moments in which domestic, cleaning, and care workers momentarily step out of their demands and inhabit a fragile space of inwardness. Rachel Randall and Catherine Grant gather these slivers of rest – from windowsill gazes to sunlit pauses during commutes – and let them speak to each other through videographic montage, revealing a shared emotional register that written scholarship has largely overlooked. By placing scenes from seven films into conversation, they illuminate how these works imagine the workers’ inner worlds, even as those vantage points remain partially inaccessible to the filmmakers themselves. The result is a video essay that not only uncovers a quiet but persistent visual motif, but also brilliantly reflects on classed and gendered asymmetries of leisure. Pausas becomes, in this sense, a meditation on who is afforded the luxury to pause – and who must steal it. Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video and Kapó by Alan O’Leary Alan O’Leary is one of the most remarkable figures in videographic criticism. His work consistently combines rigor and creativity, producing video essays that are as intellectually compelling as they are aesthetically captivating. Selecting a single piece of his for this poll borders on the absurd: each one feels like a fully realised achievement, and the sheer breadth and vitality of his output mean that there is always a new gem to discover. From the ethical and formal subtlety of Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video, and Kapó, to the analytical playfulness of Classif. & Me (Laird’s Constraint), or the exquisite formal precision of Canister in Close Up (Payne’s Constraint) (these last two produced for Avissar’s Parametric Summer Series), to the collective ingenuity of Om Shanti Omnibus, produced in collaboration with the other members of IVERN, O’Leary’s oeuvre is consistently impressive. Any one of these works could easily stand as a landmark in videographic practice, yet together they demonstrate a rare, sustained mastery that continually expands the possibilities of the form. Potbelly by Dayna McLeod Dayna McLeod has an extraordinary talent for using humour as a powerful critical instrument for her feminist intervention – her humour is very sharp, and theoretically rich. In Potbelly – as also in Age Perfect, another brilliant video essay she produced this year – she distills complex debates in aging and gender into short pieces that have the power of carrying the force of entire scholarly articles. What might take pages of academic prose, McLeod conveys through wit, performance, and an unflinching attention to how older women’s bodies are read, regulated, and stereotyped. Her comedy never softens the critique; instead, it opens a conceptual space where laughter becomes a form of resistance and a method of knowing. These pieces are miniature in duration but expansive in impact – proof that videographic insight can be both concise and powerfully transformative (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson In (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly, Lucy Fife Donaldson treats brilliantly the videographic form itself as a queer methodology, exploring how horror films disrupt spatial and bodily norms to produce disorientation that can be both unsettling and generative. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s and Jennifer M. Barker’s ideas of embodied orientation, the essay traces moments – from the drone shot in Midsommar to camera movements in The Shining, The Descent, and other genre examples – that invert, twist, and destabilise the viewer’s sense of verticality and linearity. The piece demonstrates how the video essay can make theoretical insights tangible, turning the sensory intensity of horror into a reflection on queerness, embodiment, and the potential for new orientations in both film and life. Winner of the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival Audiovisual Essay Award, it exemplifies how critical practice can inhabit, rather than resolve, the pleasures and provocations of disorientation. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur is a compelling investigation of the porous boundaries between academic analysis and creative practice, fiction and documentary, biography and autobiography. The video essay uses Varda’s film as a lens to explore how these categories intersect, allowing personal reflection and formal experimentation to illuminate one another. In just over seven minutes, it demonstrates how videographic work can enact the very concepts it theorises, producing insights that written scholarship alone might struggle to convey. Recognised with the Audiovisual Essay Award at the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival, this piece exemplifies how videography can blend rigor, artistry, and self-reflexivity in a seamless, evocative form. The voters on this poll were given the option to highlight ‘emerging voices’ in the video essay community. Some contributors chose to direct readers to specific videos, while others focused on an essayist’s whole body of work. Allie Meowy (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) Allie Meowy takes the deepest dives from angles you would never expect that are both hilarious and heartwarming in their sincerity. Amber Flannery Field (nominated by Clare O’Gara) I may be cheating slightly here, since Field has already created and published video essay-adjacent content on TikTok for several years. Given that she’s also been teasing a pivot to long-form YouTube video essays recently, though, I wanted to include her. Field is, in her own words, “the only good tour guide in New York City,” and her videos, which explore race, gender, popular culture, politics, community organising, the spaces and places of Washington DC and New York, and all the overlaps therein, are among the most compelling I’ve ever seen on TikTok. I’ve also never been more impressed by a person’s ability to unflinchingly deliver thought- and heart-wrenching commentary to a camera in so many different ways in so many different public places. Aurélie Coop (nominated by Lucy Fife Donaldson) Aurélie is in her final year at St Andrews, and produced a brilliant audiovisual essay for my course last year. Inspired by a range of sources, it draws on the range of audiovisual essay making in really inventive ways, while doing something distinctive and fresh. I’m very excited to see what she will make next! Casey Explosion (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) If you enjoy games and do not know who Casey Explosion is, you are missing out on some incredible recommendations. She has brought her thoughtful love of games to YouTube with some incredible videos. Celia Sainz (nominated by Alan O’Leary) Celia Sainz received her PhD this year from Mass Amherst, where she worked with Barbara Zecchi. Currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Spanish at Williams College, she has already made herself a leading light in videographic ecocriticism (did she invent the term?). I think her non-anthropocentric approach to videographic film studies, as evidenced in video essays like KELLY REICHARDT’S BESTIARIO (published in [in]Transition), will be increasingly prominent. Comma Splice (nominated by Hizzy Hay) Great visual animations paired with strong analysis of a YouTube medium I had no familiarity with, yet still found really engaging. Creative Destruction Video (nominated by J. Nicholas Geist) The lyric essay in creative nonfiction gets a lot of pushback from all sides, because it refuses to accept a bright line between poetry and prose, or between fiction and nonfiction. But from those complicated, messy areas of overlap arise many of my favourite essays. I haven’t really seen anyone attempting to bring the lyric essay to the video space until I saw Creative Destruction’s Fugue State Waltz. He has continued to infuse the video essay with the lyric in his Jason Voorhees: Reagan’s Golem. His more experimental essays are challenging to both viewers and, unfortunately, the algorithm. I hope he continues down this path, though, because he is making some of the most interesting and exciting video essays I’ve seen. Dex Veitch (nominated by Lucy Fife Donaldson) Dex Veitch is a junior at UMass Amherst majoring in Comp Lit and Film Studies. His video essay The Cinematic Scar: Reconceptualizing Suture Theory won second place in the Michael S. Roif Award in Film Studies for Best Video Essay in 2025, and after seeing his embodiment exercises on Orphée, I was really impressed by their expressive density. Elsie Walker (nominated by Catherine Grant) Elsie is the second of two established scholars who, as a recent alumni of the Middlebury Workshop on Scholarship in Sound and Image, made a great impact as new video essayists on this year’s Adelio Ferrero Award for Video Essays. Elsie’s highly personal and moving video essay A Beautiful Day in the Tree of Life received an honourable mention. Eva Alvarez Vazquez (nominated by Alison Peirse) Her sound work is smart, corporeal, and effective. I can’t wait to see what she does next. HeyItMeBen (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) 2025 marked Ben’s triumphant return after a year-long hiatus. His piece Searching for Hope in Iron Lung explores themes of desperation, illness, and hope. The piece examines a couple of examples that bridge the virtual and real worlds. Johanna Gustin (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) Gustin is a filmmaker and graduate student at the Stanford Documentary programme. Her desktop documentary I Think About Birds is a fascinating and ultimately breathtaking desktop documentary that draws surprising ties between manosphere/tradwife videos, nature documentaries and her own family yearnings. josh (with parentheses) (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) Josh’s ‘let me share my screen’ approach is such a compelling storytelling technique. It’s easy to get immersed in these videos, which is strange since there’s literally an interface sitting between audience and topic. Maybe there’s something skeuomorphic going on (watching a video on a computer of a computer’s interface). We’ve forgotten how to forget and You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) are great demonstrations of Josh’s signature style. Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Alison Peirse) I’ve long admired Katarzyna Paszkiewicz’s cutting edge work in feminist film studies, and it is tremendously exciting to see this major scholar beginning to think videographically. Her style is cool and calm, a balm for the overstimulated. Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Catherine Grant) Katarzyna’s amazing video essay Environmental Time, which she began working on while learning to edit at the Middlebury Workshop, was published by the Spanish academic journal Teknokultura. Revista de Cultura Digital y Movimientos Sociales in 2025. It brilliantly juxtaposes selected footage from Nomadland (2020) and Anthropocene: The Human Epoch (2018) to explore the films’ hauntological landscapes. It’s a powerful and important work and I cannot wait for more video essays by her to enter the public sphere. Laura Del Vecchio & Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Maria Hofmann) The collaboration between Laura Del Vecchio, a multidisciplinary researcher, artist, musician, editor and translator, and Katarzyna Paszkiewicz, Associate Professor in English and Film Studies at the University of the Balearic Islands, on a rumble from the core of the earth, that elegantly brings together scholarly rigor and creative expression, makes me excited for any future works by them. Lilith Grasmug (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Lilith Grasmug is an Austrian actress born in Paris. In 2017, she starred in Virgil Vernier’s Sophia Antipolis before working with Jean-Christophe Meurisse, Mikhaël Hers, Carmen Jaquier, and Claire Burger. After studying at the ECAL film department in Lausanne, she is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in contemporary art research at the Sorbonne, under the supervision of Elvan Zabunyan. Some of You Fucked Eva is her first short film as a director. Linia Verde (nominated by Jiří Anger) A group of Romanian students, mentored by Ana Szel and Liri Chapelan, created a remarkable collection of video essays on the themes of hyperobjects and ecocriticism. Published in Film a doba under the title A Small Batch of Irrepresentable Entities, this collection displays a playfulness and an engagement with topics that reach beyond strict film studies toward the environmental humanities – both of which are more than welcome. Marine de Dardel (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) de Dardel is a doctoral researcher working with me and Johannes Binotto, and her videographic work makes bold experiments with textual, audiovisual and verbal language. The Colour Out of Space (linked above) uses creative coding to programme a future iteration of Locarno Film Festival using a dataset derived from the festival. Her other works of this year, (DES)ASTRES.ai and Promontorium Somnii (Post Mortem) each reveal distinctly different possibilities for videographic approaches to generative AI. Marta Cerón León (nominated by Dayna McLeod) I had the pleasure of working with Marta and some other incredible students in the Film Studies programme at the University of Massachusetts Amherst this fall where they are making really great work. In Embodied Sound, a brittle and crunchy soundscape reframes the pharmacy scene in Vuk Lungulov-Klotz’s 2023 Mutt, where the protagonist walks the aisles while on the phone. As Marta says, “the sound makes the space feel prescriptive, as if the drugs themselves speak or were making sounds while framing the body.” In two of her other videos that also work with Mutt – Supercut and OnScreen Cameo – Marta intervenes in scenes to show us how the main character is constantly framed, contained, and surveilled. Keep an eye out for Marta’s work! Maud Ceuterick (nominated by Alan O’Leary) Maud Ceuterick has published just two video essays so far, I think, but they are different enough, and so interesting in their individual ways, that they announce an important maker. The ferocious RAWR: Kitchen Rage Judith and I was published last year in Teknokultura. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen abjection mobilised like this in a scholarly context. Filming Out Loud, made in dialogue with the anthropologist Carola Ludovica Giannotti Mura and published in Academic Quarter, interrogates the epistemic and ethical affordances of videographic criticism with sensitivity and reflexive intelligence. May Santiago (nominated by Alan O’Leary) May Santiago, a performance academic based in Baltimore, has already been nominated multiple times for this poll. She describes her PhD work as archiving as activism, or as a counter to the colonial archive of Puerto Rico. Video essays such as Desidentificación (published in Burges and Cooper’s Personal Mediascapes collection) and Agencia (presented at SCMS in Chicago this year), combine archival and performative material, self-generated footage and personal revelation. They are incredibly intense and somehow intensely glamorous. Noa Epars & Marvin Merkel (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Born in 1998 in Penthalaz, he is of Swiss origin. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in French Literature and History at the University of Lausanne, he began studying cinema at the HEAD – Geneva (University of Art and Design) in 2021. In 2022, he co-directed Serafina, presented in official competition at the 75th Locarno Film Festival and at the New Directors/New Films Festival at the MoMA. The same year, he directed The Misanthrope, presented in several European festivals. Marvin Merkel is a Lausanne-based artist who combines photography with his sculptural and performative work. The nominator specifically highlighted their newest piece, Always Wanted to Be God, Never Wanted to Do Good. Renegade Cut (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) While he has been making videos for a long time, his recent pivot into making whatever he wants has been an incredible creative inspiration to what video essays can be. Rotem Sudman (nominated by Colleen Laird) Rotem Sudman is an extraordinarily promising emerging voice whose work moves with equal measures of young intellectual rigor and technical precision informed by moral courage and a palpably bursting heart. My first encounter with her videographic essay was through her entry on Terrace House in the TV Dictionary series (published in [in]Transition), which I reviewed. Sudman is a deft editor, but she is also something rarer: a maker who understands the video essay as a method of critical witnessing. Her ongoing research demonstrates a profound commitment to rethinking film’s relationship to history, memory, political struggle, and stakes. Sudman brings a perspective that is both ethically attuned and urgently needed. Forthcoming in 2026 peer-reviewed publications, her efforts confront the violences operational in archival erasure while offering space for counter-narratives to emerge. Sudman’s work gives me hope. Salomé Aguilera Skvirsky (nominated by Catherine Grant) Salomé is one of two established scholars who, as recent alumna of the Middlebury Workshop on Scholarship in Sound and Image, made a great impact as new video essayists on this year’s Adelio Ferrero Award for Video Essays. Salomé’s astonishingly original work Our Morals and Theirs on the Chilean film El chacal de Nahueltoro (Miguel Littín, 1969) took first prize. Samantha Wojcik (nominated by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski) Samantha’s work, inspired by Agnès Varda’s The Gleaners and I, was in high consideration for the first annual graduate student video essay award organised through the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, judged by myself, Allison Cooper (Bowdoin College), and Andrea Comiskey (Carnegie Mellon University). She uses an expanded definition of ‘gleaning’ to take the spectator on a joyous, eclectic tour of queer and queer-adjacent imagery, concluding with an exhilarating performance in the desktop documentary form. Sarah Davis Baker (nominated by Dan Schindel) Baker has come out of the gate as a video essayist with some really strong stuff this year. She’s very thoughtful and has done a great job of finding novel topics and approaching them from unexpected angles. Check out The Internet Used to Be a Place. Silvia Cipelletti (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) Cipelletti is part of my research group and in 2025 really came into her own with several video essays, Mediterranean Border and Algorithmic Borders (later adapted into a segment for the TV series PhantasIA), which are part of her doctoral dissertation research on videographic approaches to border landscapes, and her collaboration with Evelyn Kreutzer Locarno parla italiano – 404!: Glitching Locarno Film Festival explored the divided realities under the surface of a celebratory event. All these works demonstrate an energetic and self-exposing approach to negotiating between desktop and ethnographic field research. Therapist Plus Gamer (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) Jared (Therapist Plus Gamer) has been doing one of my favourite things on this platform: bringing real-life professional expertise into video essays. I’m glad he finds the time to be so productive at crafting well-made, educational, and entertaining videos. Watching his latest piece during lunch is a ritual I look forward to every week. Timothée Engasser (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Born in Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire in 1991, Timothée Engasser lives and works between Marseille and Lille. A graduate in urban sociology with a thesis in research and creation (ENSAV/Université du Mirail), he has pursued the themes of his research in cinematographic works on the edge of reality, between documentary and experimental. His films include Tenace, Il y a un endroit dans la nuit and Omens bloom in the dark, which have been screened at a number of international festivals (International Kurzfilmtage Winterthur, Les Yeux ouverts, Entrevues de Belfort, FRAC Grand Large). He seeks to explore the imaginary worlds among traces, ruins and gaps. The nominator specifically highlighted their piece, Home Is Where the Heart Is. Tingyu Chen (nominated by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski) Tingyu’s videographic analysis of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman was highly ranked by Allison Cooper (Bowdoin College), Andrea Comiskey (Carnegie Mellon University), and myself for the first annual graduate student video essay award organised through the Society for Cinema and Media Studies. This ambitious project intensifies the film’s spatial qualities using deformative methods to expand our understanding of a film better known for its durational representation of women’s labor. Toni’s Film Club (nominated by Queline Meadows) While Toni has been releasing videos for a few years now, he seemed to really hit his stride in 2025. He puts a ton of effort into everything he makes (many of his recent videos include interviews) and I can’t wait to see what he does next. Valeria Villegas Lindvall (nominated by Alison Peirse) A major new thinker in decolonial horror criticism, Valeria Villegas Lindvall is now finding her voice in videographic criticism. And that voice is raw punk energy. weisensei (nominated by Hizzy Hay) A video essayist with a background as a story artist, which provides a unique perspective on what makes media excel.

Title: Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI
URL: https://beincrypto.com/nvidia-absorbs-rival-decentralized-ai/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T00:53:24Z
Full Content:
Written & Edited byOihyun Kim NVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company’s largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance. The chipmaker’s latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia’s growing dominance. The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company’s assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a “non-exclusive licensing agreement.” Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant’s Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive. The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and employees while licensing the startup’s technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia’s $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022. The Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia’s approach bluntly: “We will buy you before you can compete with us.” Nvidia's newest strategy:"We will buy you before you can compete with us."There has never been a company like Nvidia. https://t.co/wsbuAgIqyM Groq’s Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem. The timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: “We’re delighted by Google’s success… NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it’s the only platform that runs every AI model.” When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting. While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure. “People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that’s data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,” Jack Collier, io.net’s Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings. However, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia’s acquisition of Groq’s low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance. The transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia’s financial gravity remains to be seen.

Title: Rich like Bill Gates: Meet the Saudi sisters wielding $75 billion in a man’s world

When President Donald Trump feted Saudi Arabia’s crown prince at a state dinner last month, invitees included heavyweights like Apple boss Tim Cook and Citigroup’s Jane Fraser. Seated next to Elon Musk was Lubna Olayan, whose deep connections to both Wall Street and the kingdom marked her out as one of the most influential people in a room packed with luminaries. That White House banquet underscored the growing influence of the Olayan Group, a sprawling and secretive Saudi empire that Lubna and her sister Hutham have helmed for decades. The duo came of age at a time when women weren’t permitted to drive and needed a male guardian’s permission to even get a passport in the kingdom. Yet they’ve managed to steer the family conglomerate into a behemoth that operates at the scale of a sovereign wealth fund. Described as frank and outgoing, Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan has a reputation for being deeply involved with her family’s investments.Credit: Bloomberg The group controls a nearly $US13 billion ($19.6 billion) stock portfolio in the US, with stakes worth almost $US1 billion in BlackRock and $US1.5 billion in JPMorgan Chase, filings show. A large investor in Credit Suisse before its collapse, the conglomerate boasts a prime property portfolio that spans from Madison Avenue to central London. It has forged a large Dubai real-estate deal with Brookfield, and makes vast investments in private equity and fixed income. At home, it bottles Coca-Cola, runs Burger King outlets and services oilfields. Those bets have transformed the Olayan clan into one of the world’s richest families. Their fortune is valued at more than $US50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is including them in its annual list for the first time. That figure doesn’t fully reflect the magnitude of their riches, according to people familiar with the matter, as the group discloses limited financial information. Many of them pegged the Olayans’ net worth well above $US100 billion, putting them in the same league as Bill Gates, Carlos Slim and Mukesh Ambani. ‘Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy. We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.’ That makes the Olayans richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett. Their influence extends well beyond that financial firepower, aided in part by a loyalty to Saudi Arabia during tough times that’s made the group an indispensable national fixture, people familiar with the matter said. The extent of the Olayans’ reach often has Wall Street bosses reaching out for advice as they race to expand in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s nearly $US1.3 trillion economy. “MBS continues to be drawn to the US as preferred partner in security and economic development,” said Steffen Hertog, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “Having private interlocutors with close links to US finance is useful.” A US-based representative for the Olayan Group didn’t comment and directed all requests to a Saudi-based spokesperson, who didn’t respond to a detailed list of questions. Most global executives are reluctant to speak about the family for fear of offending the sisters, who are known to fiercely guard their privacy. This story is based on an analysis of the family’s investments, operating companies and filings of family-owned entities, as well as interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the group, who asked not to be named discussing information that isn’t public. Hutham and Lubna, both in their early seventies, were born in Saudi Arabia to Suliman Olayan. The patriarch was orphaned at a young age and started out working as a dispatcher for the predecessor company of Saudi Aramco, leveraging his fluent English. He mortgaged his house for $US8000 to win a pipeline contract, according to a profile in Time magazine, eventually launching the Olayan Group in 1947. From there, Suliman diversified aggressively, and the group went on to strike partnerships to sell Colgate toothpaste, Oreos and Coca-Cola in the kingdom. He bought US equities to use as credit with American banks and by 1980, his conglomerate brought in more than $US300 million in annual revenue, according to the Time profile. His globalist bent created a uniquely bi-national empire that the daughters were immersed in early. Both studied in the US and were given significant jobs in the family business on their return. After Suliman’s death in 2002, his son Khaled was named chairman of Olayan Group, but Lubna and Hutham helped run much of the family’s vast operations. Lubna led the Mideast-focused division and Hutham took charge of Olayan America. The sisters married foreigners and took on prominent roles — Lubna was the first woman elected to the board of a public company in Saudi Arabia in 2004. Even then, women’s rights were severely limited in the kingdom. Only in 2018 were women finally given the right to drive. In an interview with NPR in 2018, Lubna recalled the difficulty finding a ladies room in factories and boardrooms because there were usually no women. She began approaching government officials and executives for help boosting the female workforce — all the while being reminded to tread carefully and attempting to avoid confrontation. “So, you negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she said in the interview about those early efforts. Along the way, the sisters developed reputations for being steely negotiators. Their ascent was aided by an ability to keep a low profile and the duo ensured their business was seen as supportive of the government’s aims. The group is now officially headquartered in Liechtenstein, with offices around the world, including in Athens, where Lubna’s lawyer husband has deep ties. Over the years, the family has gained a reputation for running a stringently professional organisation that’s sophisticated in its dealmaking at a level not typically seen at family offices. The Olayans are deemed richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett.Credit: AP “The family was very conscious of incorporating corporate governance frameworks into their business, and they did it with a high level of professionalism,” said Josiane Fahed-Sreih, director of the Institute of Family and Entrepreneurial Business at Lebanese American University. In one sign of their influence, the Olayan family was untouched in 2017 when dozens of Saudi royals, former officials and businessmen, including Alwaleed, were detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as the crown prince consolidated power and conducted an unprecedented national shakeup. Alwaleed, worth about $US17 billion these days, has made a comeback of sorts in recent years and his investment group has benefited from the kingdom’s construction frenzy. In the 1990s, the businessman was known for a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently pictured on a private yacht purchased from Donald Trump. The Olayans do things differently. “Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy,” Hutham said about the Olayan family in a speech to the Arab Bankers Association of North America in 2013. “We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.” Even so, there have been investing missteps. A longtime investor in Credit Suisse, they stuck by the bank even through its downturn, ultimately becoming one of the big losers in the turmoil that culminated with UBS Group’s discount purchase of the troubled lender. The losses were at a scale that could roil large financial firms, but one international executive recalls the collapse being treated as a relative non-event within the Olayan Group. The conglomerate continued to execute transactions and payments as normal during the period, the person said. Saudi National Bank, the Swiss lender’s top shareholder, was among firms that lost money on its investment and its chairman resigned in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the Olayans’ profile has only grown in the years since. Key to that are their relationships on Wall Street and within the kingdom, particularly as Riyadh has started to intensify pressure on foreign firms to invest more locally and help diversify the economy. Despite recent fiscal pressures, Saudi Arabia remains a lucrative market for the titans of global finance: Riyadh ranks as one of the biggest issuers of debt in recent years, while the kingdom’s wealth fund has shown an appetite for blockbuster deals like the recent $US55 billion transaction to take Electronic Arts Inc private. Lubna has close connections to BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, among others, and was recently named co-chair of the US-Saudi Business Council alongside Citi’s Fraser. Hutham sits on the board of Brookfield, which ranks as one of the biggest private equity investors in the Middle East. This year, during Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative conference, often called Davos in the Desert, Lubna hosted a party in Riyadh that had top global financial executives and officials mingling over canapés and rice and lamb, according to one attendee. Their links run broader than just finance. The US equity investments their father started to amass in the 1960s have grown to $US12.7 billion. These days, the portfolio includes stakes in Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. By comparison, Saudi Arabia’s $US1 trillion wealth fund owns just over $US19 billion in US stocks. The group’s private equity portfolio forms another large chunk, and is estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Compounded annual growth rate for direct investments has exceeded 30 per cent over a 10-year period, according to its website. The firm’s real-estate holdings span more than 40 million square feet and 40,000 apartments under management. At home, the Olayans have backed the kingdom’s biggest efforts. When Saudi Aramco’s $US25 billion IPO struggled to attract international investors in 2019, the Olayan family was among those tapped locally by the administration of MBS — as the de facto ruler is called — to shore up demand. Lubna Olayan has successfully navigated the obstacles for women in the Saudi business world. “You negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she says.Credit: Bloomberg At the same time, the sisters have managed a careful balancing act with their public comments. In 2018, as much of Wall Street avoided the kingdom’s FII conference after Saudi agents murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Lubna used the start of a panel discussion to mourn his death, saying that the act ran counter to Saudi values. “We are very grateful that the terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,” Lubna said in her address. These days, Lubna is chair of the Olayan Group’s corporate board, according to a recent press release from the US-Saudi Business Council. Hutham chairs the shareholders’ board, the group’s website says. Day-to-day operations are mostly managed by the likes of Chief Executive Officer Hani Lazkani and Chief Operating Officer Samer Yaghnam, people familiar with the matter said, though the sisters remain the public face of the group and helm broad strategy with family members. Multiple people described Lubna as frank and outgoing, with a reputation for being deeply involved with her investments. Like her father, she’s worldly and warm but also incisive, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a friend of the late Suliman. “If you talk with her about current events, it’s not just, ‘This happened.’ She understands why things are moving the way they are.” Hutham, meanwhile, appears soft-spoken and grandmotherly in conversation, but her line of gentle questioning can elicit small details that can serve as fodder for the negotiating table, according to one international executive. The sisters are among the few people who understand the true extent of their sprawling business in its entirety, and tightly control its financial details. There have been moments in past years when a listing of an operating business seemed imminent, but deals haven’t materialised. Meanwhile, much has changed for Saudi women in the workforce. In the past seven years, the kingdom has announced reforms allowing women to set up businesses without male consent and travel independently, and many now run private equity funds, trade stocks and work in factories. “We look for opportunities, even in adversity,” said Hutham in her 2013 speech about her family. “We see silver linings.” Bloomberg The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Why Solana, Zcash, and the Trump Administration defined 2025, and what their dominance means for 2026. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If 2024 was the year of the crypto reawakening, 2025 was the year the plumbing finally got permitted. This year, the emerging industry entered January with tentative optimism and exited December with federal statutes. As a result, the narrative shifted definitively from “crypto as a casino” to “crypto as capital markets infrastructure.” During this period, volumes moved on-chain, policy moved into the White House, and major asset managers moved past their hesitation, as evidenced most starkly by Vanguard’s reversal earlier this month, which allowed crypto ETFs on its platform. With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. However, in a year defined by record-breaking flows and legislative victories, not everyone shared the spoils equally. The winners of 2025 weren’t just the assets that went up; they were the protocols, people, and products that fundamentally secured their place in the future of finance. Based on CryptoSlate's analysis, here are the 12 definitive winners of the year and why they mattered: There is no discussion of the crypto landscape in 2025 without acknowledging the sheer force of the US pivot. For years, the industry operated with one foot out the door, eyeing Dubai or Singapore. In 2025, the US slammed that door shut and locked everyone inside—happily. Considering this, the victory is shared between the jurisdiction itself and the catalyst at the top. The 47th President’s administration delivered on the industry's longest-held wish list in under 12 months, effectively re-onshoring the digital asset economy. Several Executive Orders backing digital assets set the tone, but the strategic victories were tactical. The signing of the GENIUS Act on July 18 provided the first federal definition for stablecoins, while the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” Executive Order in March signaled to sovereign wealth funds globally that digital assets were a matter of national security. Hines rejected the idea of a numeric target for Bitcoin federal holdings, saying the US wants as much as it can get. Crucially, by pushing a leadership change at the SEC and the CFTC, the administration cleared the “regulation by enforcement” fog. Essentially, Trump's actions have set the tone to make the US “the crypto capital of the world.” The premier vehicle for institutional access didn't just survive its sophomore year; it thrived despite BTC's poor performance. This was evidenced by BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerging as one of the top 10 US ETFs by inflows, outpacing traditional heavyweights such as the Invesco QQQ Trust and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). Away from the flagship digital asset, Ethereum spot ETFs cemented their status as the default on-ramp for wealth managers, rendering the “not your keys, not your coins” debate irrelevant for the suit-and-tie crowd. The pivotal moment came in September when the SEC approved **generic listing standards**. This technical but crucial policy win slashed the red tape for future products, removing the need for 19b-4 filings for every single new ticker. As a result, the market welcomed an avalanche of new products focused on other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, which also delivered strong performance this year. Solana effectively shed its “beta” reputation in 2025, as the “fast but breaks” narrative is dead. At the same time, Solana pulled off the most difficult pivot in crypto this year by going from the “memecoin casino” to the “liquidity layer” of the global market. Kalshi and Polymarket just had their biggest month ever as Solana's memecoin share fell to cycle lows. We chart the flows and test the rotation thesis. While it maintained its cultural dominance, CoinGecko reported that Solana was the most-followed blockchain ecosystem globally in 2025 for the second consecutive year. The network is no longer just about speculative tokens; it is now where efficient capital lives. According to Artemis data, Solana has emerged as a fundamental liquidity layer, with on-chain SOL-USD trading volume exceeding the combined SOL spot volume on Binance and Bybit, two of the top three centralized exchanges by trading volume, for three consecutive months. Essentially, Solana has differentiated itself as the primary venue for execution-sensitive activity. It is no longer just competing with Ethereum; it is competing with Nasdaq. If Solana won on speed, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, won on distribution. By leveraging the US-based exchange's massive existing user base, Base became the sticky default for consumer apps and stablecoin experimentation. Coinbase aims to transform crypto wallets into super-apps, integrating trading, social media, and merchant services. Base proved that in 2025, distribution matters more than novel cryptography. It became the launchpad for “normie” crypto—consumer fintech apps that use crypto rails on the backend without the user ever knowing. It is the bridge between the chaotic on-chain world and the regulated safety of Coinbase. After years of legal purgatory, 2025 was the year Ripple and XRP were finally set free. The long-running battle between the firm and the SEC officially concluded with a final judgment that cleared the runway for institutional adoption. As a result, XRP's narrative shifted overnight from “litigation risk” to “liquidity engine,” driving its value upward and paving the way for the launch of the first Spot XRP ETFs in November. At the same time, the company behind it, Ripple, spent the year aggressively buying the plumbing of traditional finance. Ripple deployed over $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this year alone, most notably the purchase of prime broker Hidden Road, treasury management firm GTreasury, and stablecoin infrastructure provider Rail. Ripple raised $500M at a $40B valuation from Citadel and Fortress, but the capital went to equity, not XRP. A bigger Ripple doesn't automatically mean higher prices for XRP. These moves have effectively transformed Ripple from a “payments company” into a full-stack institutional powerhouse. The surprise comeback of the year was Zcash and the privacy sector as a whole. Emerging as the undisputed best-performing sector of 2025, privacy coins shed their “illicit” stigma to become the darlings of the post-surveillance economy. While Zcash led the charge, the momentum was sector-wide. Ethereum developers accelerated their privacy initiatives, while other privacy solutions finally gained mainnet traction. Institutional interest and network resilience guide Zcash's resurgence as regulatory landscapes shift. Moreover, the regulatory thaw was palpable as the SEC held formal meetings with privacy protocol leaders to discuss compliant architecture. Notably, that would have been unthinkable a year ago. Real World Assets (RWAs) moved from “pilot programs” to “critical plumbing,” heavily aided by a friendly SEC. The Commission’s shift away from hostile enforcement allowed major players to integrate these assets without fear of a Wells Notice. Banks once shunned crypto custody; now they’re racing to tokenize trillions in cash and securities. The quiet rebuild is underway, and it’s happening inside the balance sheets of Goldman, Citi, and BlackRock. The watershed moment was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund being accepted as off-exchange collateral on Binance. This blurred the lines between TradFi and the crypto market structure. By December, tokenized money market funds and T-bills had surpassed $8 billion in AUM, while the broader RWA market is around $20 billion. Moreover, traditional financial giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, Fidelity, Nasdaq, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) are heavily banking on the sector to make the traditional financial sector more transparent and efficient. Like Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair, said: “On-chain markets will bring greater predictability, transparency, and efficiency for investors.” The “killer app” debate is over. Stablecoins are the rail. The sector's market cap breached $300 billion in October, while Ethereum-based stablecoin supply hit an all-time high of $166 billion in September. In fact, Token Terminal stated that the total number of stablecoin holders is at an all-time high of around 200 million. This shows that the sector's growth was driven by these assets' ability to settle instantly, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, legislative progress in the US, especially the passage of the GENIUS Act, provided the legal clarity for banks to enter the fray. Essentially, stablecoins are no longer just trading chips; they are becoming the settlement layer for global fintech. Jeremy NG, the founder of Open Eden, captured it best, saying: “Stablecoins have crossed the line from crypto plumbing to financial infrastructure.” On-chain derivatives crossed the credibility chasm as monthly volumes hit a record $1.2 trillion in October. This sector won because it successfully siphoned volume from centralized exchanges (CEXs) by offering self-custody and, frankly, better incentives. The rise of perp DEXs like Hyperliquid and Aster signals a maturity in DeFi market structure. Traders are increasingly comfortable leaving billions in smart contract risk to avoid counterparty risk. 2025 was the year event contracts entered the US mainstream as Kalshi and Polymarket, the two dominant platforms in the sector, printed record numbers this year. However, the headline winner is that several traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms like Gemini and Coinbase have also thrown their hats into the nascent sector. Prediction markets have become Wall Street’s newest battleground, with Kalshi betting on regulation and Polymarket betting on decentralization—and both racing to turn real-world events into tradeable assets. This sector won because it bridged the gap between “gambling” and “finance.” With Polymarket also receiving a path forward via an amended CFTC framework, event contracts are moving from niche internet curiosities to regulated hedging instruments. While the US focused on legislation, Hong Kong focused on execution supremacy—and the data proves it. In Q3 2025, Hong Kong's ETP market officially overtook South Korea and Japan to become the third largest globally by turnover, with average daily turnover hitting HK$37.8 billion (+150% YoY). The city's strategy of regulatory clarity paid off in tangible exchange milestones. The VATP (Virtual Asset Trading Platform) regime matured from a “deemed-to-be-licensed” purgatory into a robust ecosystem. Hong Kong's new crypto initiatives target institutional capital amid competition with Singapore and Dubai. By mid-2025, the SFC granted full licenses to additional major global exchanges, bringing the total number of licensed exchanges to 11. This effectively funneled regional institutional liquidity into a compliant, bank-connected net, isolating unregulated players. At the same time, the city's Stablecoins Ordinance that came into force on Aug. 1, created a pristine sandbox that attracted over 30 applicants by the September deadline. The final spot on this list belongs to you—the cohort that stayed. Over the past grueling years, early believers were told that crypto was a fraud, a bubble, or a dead end. They endured the collapse of 2022, the regulatory chokehold of the Gensler years, and the boredom of 2024. In 2025, they were vindicated. This year wasn't just about “numbers go up”; it was about “thesis proved right.” Related ReadingSEC Chair Gary Gensler issues stark warning about crypto investing ahead of Bitcoin ETF decisionWith the SEC expected to imminently approve a Bitcoin ETF, Chair Gensler alerts investors to risks involved in crypto investments.

Title: Ethereum price under pressure as $6B options expiry nears

ETH options data shows investors increasing downside protection as the year-end $6 billion options expry approaches, signaling caution. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) has been unable to sustain prices above $3,400 for the past 40 days, raising concerns among traders that bears may remain in control longer. Key takeaways: $6B in Ether options will expire on Friday, with call (buy) bets outnumbering put (sell) instruments by 2.2 times. Bears hold the advantage unless ETH price breaks $3,100. The $6 billion ETH options expiry on Friday may add further pressure, as bulls had anticipated year-end prices of $4,000 or higher before the 28% crash in November. Ether’s price at 8:00 am UTC on Friday will determine whether bears retain control, despite call options outnumbering put instruments by a factor of 2.2. Deribit accounts for 70% of total open interest, followed by the Chicago-based CME with 20%. However, most of the $4.1 billion in call options are set to expire worthless on Friday, as traders concentrated bullish bets on year-end Ether prices between $3,500 and $5,000. Less than 15% of aggregate call options were positioned at $3,000 or lower. Related: Trend Research quietly becomes one of Ethereum’s largest whales with 46K ETH buy Even excluding overly optimistic calls at $5,000 and above, which likely carried limited cost to buyers, data shows that fewer than 25% of these instruments were placed below $3,200. Traders often sell covered calls at $8,000 and $10,000 year-end strikes with no realistic expectation of reaching those levels. While bulls were overly confident that Ether would reclaim $3,400 by year-end, bearish strategies may also have gone too far by clustering bets between $2,200 and $2,900. If Ether trades above $2,950 on Friday, more than 60% of the $1.9 billion in aggregate put options will expire worthless. Even so, bearish positions remain better placed as long as ETH stays below $3,200. Investors reacted to Thursday’s reports that Intel failed in its push to manufacture advanced chips in the US as it sought to challenge global leader Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC US). According to Bloomberg, Nvidia (NVDA US) halted production tests that relied on Intel’s manufacturing processes. As traders priced in weaker prospects for the economic impact of artificial intelligence in the US, many moved to hedge their ETH positions. Demand for bearish ETH options strategies increased, including the “bear diagonal put spread,” “bear put spread” and “bear call spread,” particularly after multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $3,400 level over the past five weeks. Below are four probable scenarios for the year-end ETH aggregate options expiry based on current price trends: $2,700 to $2,900: The net result favors the put instruments by $580 million. $2,901 to $3,000: The net result favors the put instruments by $440 million. $3,101 to $3,200: Balanced outcome between call and put options. $3,201 to $3,300: The net result favors the call instruments by $150 million. A Friday expiry below $2,900 could further weaken Ether investor sentiment. However, Ether bulls still have an opportunity to push prices toward $3,100 on Friday, which would help balance positioning and distance Ether’s price from the $2,775 December lows.

Fifteen months after seeing its first five commercial mobile-broadband satellites reach orbit, AST SpaceMobile now has a sixth circling the Earth. The first of the company’s second-generation BlueBird Block 2 satellites lifted off at 10:25 p.m. EST Tuesday from India’s Satish Dhawan Space Centre atop an LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark III) rocket. About 15 minutes later, mission controllers confirmed the satellite’s deployment into a 323-mile-high orbit from the upper stage of that expendable launch vehicle. “This launch validates years of US innovation and American manufacturing, executed by our team, and marks the transition to scaled deployment,” AST’s press release quotes Abel Avellan, its founder, chairman, and CEO. “With BlueBird 6 now in orbit, we are firmly on the path to delivering true space-based cellular broadband directly to everyday smartphones, at a global scale.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated the launch in a post on X, saying it featured “the heaviest satellite ever launched from Indian soil” and advanced India’s self-reliance agenda. The country is working toward inaugurating its own human spaceflight program with an upgraded version of the LVM3 rocket. BlueBird 6 is a much larger spacecraft than AST’s first five production satellites, launched in September 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The Midland, Tex., company’s press release touts the new spacecraft as “the largest commercial communications array ever deployed in low Earth orbit,” at almost 2,400 square feet. AST says this design’s massive antenna and processing capability will allow it to support more than 2,000 cells per satellite, with 120Mbps of bandwidth per cell for messaging, voice, and data service to unmodified phones on the ground. Achieving that full capacity, however, will require an upgraded ASIC that a November earnings release reported is not set for “first integration” with a satellite until Q1 2026. AST’s Tuesday announcement predicted that the company will launch 45 to 60 satellites by the end of the year, which company executives have said would be more than enough to provide commercial coverage across the US for its partners AT&T and Verizon. The company aims for its next launch in January from Cape Canaveral and plans to step up its delivery cadence by using higher-capacity launch vehicles. In its November earnings call, executives said the Falcon 9 can loft three next-gen BlueBirds at a time, while Blue Origin’s New Glenn can carry eight at a time. AST, however, is now years and hundreds of satellites behind SpaceX’s Starlink, which has been providing messaging and, more recently, app-specific data roaming service to T-Mobile and other partner carriers with 650-plus direct-to-cell Starlinks. Many industry analysts, having seen AST repeatedly fall behind its own forecasts, now predict that AST won’t be able to provide substantial competition to Starlink in direct-to-device service until 2027. This company does, however, hold one non-trivial advantage in what looks like an extremely one-sided contest so far: It’s the one firm somewhat reasonably positioned to provide a commercial direct-to-cell alternative to SpaceX and its mercurial CEO, Elon Musk.

Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week's 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. The weekly report was released a day early due to the Christmas holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market.

Last week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk's purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. WATCH: Jobs report reveals cooling labor market and 'uneven economy,' analyst says Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government's data. The Labor Department's report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 750 to 216,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 13 rose by 38,000 to 1.92 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: How XRP Is Approaching A Structural Break That Could Change Everything

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After years of compression, XRP is quietly approaching a moment where the market will see a true structural break. This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: BlackRock strategists expect limited rate cuts in 2026 unless labor market cracks

Time Published: 2025-12-24T15:11:11Z

Share this article The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver limited rate cuts in 2026 unless there is a sharp deterioration in the labor market, according to BlackRock senior strategists Amanda Lynam and Dominique Bly. Their outlook reflects recent US labor market data, which point to modest softening but no sharp downturn. Although the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, the highest since 2021, analysts noted that part of the increase was driven by higher labor force participation and government job losses rather than a fundamental weakening in labor conditions. From a policy standpoint, the Fed continues to view labor risks as balanced, according to BlackRock’s strategists. Recent data echo some downside concerns flagged by Chair Jerome Powell, but do not signal a major breakdown in employment conditions, they stated. With 175 basis points of cuts already implemented since September 2024 and policy rates approaching neutral, BlackRock sees limited room for aggressive easing in 2026. Further cuts would depend on a sharp labor market decline, which they do not expect. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Here’s How High Bitcoin Price Would Be At Gold’s ATH Market Cap
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/how-high-bitcoin-price-gold/
Time Published: 2025-12-24T14:30:47Z
Full Content:
Gold has reached unprecedented price levels at the end of 2025, breaking above $4,525 per ounce and setting fresh all-time highs as Bitcoin price continues to struggle. That surge has pushed gold’s total market capitalization to levels that dwarf the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This difference between gold, the established safe-haven asset and Bitcoin, a growing digital store of value, invites a provocative question: if BTC’s total valuation equaled gold’s peak market cap, what price would BTC have to reach? Gold’s rally in 2025 captured global attention as prices climbed past $4,500 per ounce for the first time, setting a new record that reflects more than just short-term speculation. Gold’s strength this year is not just about price per ounce. In market-cap terms, gold has added about $12 trillion in value since the start of 2025 alone. That single-year increase in gold’s market capitalization is around seven times larger than the entire Bitcoin market cap. This recent all-time high price has helped boost gold’s total market capitalization to an estimated $31.1 trillion, based on the total value of above-ground gold stocks multiplied by the elevated price per ounce. Bitcoin’s market capitalization currently stands at $1.736 trillion, based on a circulating supply of just under 20 million BTC. Unlike gold, BTC’S total valuation has not increased this year. Instead, it has shrunk by roughly $100 billion since January 1, with its price now struggling in the mid-$80,000s. Market Cap Of Gold And Bitcoin. Source: Companiemarketcap.com Put simply, Bitcoin is only a small slice of gold’s valuation. At today’s levels, gold’s $31 trillion market cap means that Bitcoin fits into gold roughly 18 times over. This ratio is a good reference point for Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, given its reputation as a digital version of gold. If Bitcoin were to match gold’s $31 trillion market capitalization, the corresponding price per BTC would be considerably higher than current levels. Using a circulating supply of about 19.96 million BTC, BTC would need to push to approximately $1.55 million per coin to reach parity with gold’s current all-time-high market cap. The amount of capital inflow needed for BTC to reach this price level is massive and unprecedented. Still, many Bitcoin maximalists believe this scenario is not unrealistic over an extended timeframe. Michael Saylor, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, has proposed that BTC will eventually surpass gold in total market value within the next 10 years. In a November interview, Saylor said he has “no doubt” that BTC will become a larger asset class than gold by 2035. It is obvious that 2025 is about to be a red year for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market. However, 2026 could play out as a recovery and normalization year. Recovery in this context does not imply explosive upside, but a period where bearish price action is worked off and confidence in BTC is rebuilt gradually.

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week and remain at historically healthy levels despite some signs that the labor market is weakening. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week’s 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That’s below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. The weekly report was released a day early due to the Christmas holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 750 to 216,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 13 rose by 38,000 to 1.92 million, the government said.

AIBiggest DisappointmentsKotaku 2025LayoffsMindsEyeTariffsTrump I’d hoped 2025 would be a better year than 2024. And in some personal ways, it was. But it was also yet another year filled with layoffs, AI slop, greedy execs, price increases, and more signs that the entire game industry is collapsing. So, like we’ve done in years past, Kotaku has rounded up a collection of some of the worst, most disappointing video game news and events from 2025 and catalogued it in a handy dandy list. Take breaks as you scroll through this, and let’s all hope 2026 is better. It can’t be worse, right? Please, tell me it can’t be worse. Please… This was the year in which, more than ever before, a lot of big games got canned, or we learned about projects that were binned not long ago. Perfect Dark, the slick-looking reboot of Rare’s sci-fi shooter series? Canned, and the studio behind it shuttered. A Wonder Woman game from Monolith? Canceled taking the beloved studio behind No One Lives Forever and Shadow of Mordor down with it. An EA-published Black Panther game from some former Monolith devs that would have reportedly featured a version of Mordor’s popular Nemesis System? Dead and the studio behind it closed, too. EA also shelved a Titanfall extraction shooter spin-off; Sony killed a few live-service games, including a God of War multiplayer project; and a cool-looking Transformers game from Splash Damage got the axe this year, leading to, you guessed it, layoffs. And these are just the ones that we know about. I’d bet a lot more games were canceled in 2025 as publishers continue to focus more and more on fewer franchises that can be reliably counted on to turn a profit. And as noted, many of these cancellations led to layoffs and studios being closed, a problem worth talking about separately, because in 2025, these cuts and closings happened a lot.Â 2025 wasnât as bad for industry layoffs as 2024, but it was still pretty terrible. Nearly 10,000 developers lost jobs, according to layoff tracker Amir Satvat. Thatâs down from the over 15,000 pink-slips peak of 2025, but still up from 2022. The big cutbacks were once again at Microsoft, which shaved hundreds of jobs across its gaming division, including at Rare, Zenimax, and King.Â But those were hardly the only ones. Notable teams like Cloud Chamber, working on BioShock 4, lost dozens of staff, Amazon Gaming cut over 100 positions, and Square Enix made cuts across its international publishing business. Indies were also still hit hard. Heart Machine had to lay people off and end Hyper Light Breaker Early Access development early, while Wreckreation maker Three Fields Entertainment turned to Patreon as it looks for new funding.Â Randomly looking up the developer behind Floppy Knights to see what they were working on next, only to find a shutdown notice on their homepage, pretty much summed up the ongoing industry vibe.Â – Ethan Gach Generative AI isn’t new tech. It’s been floating around for a few years now. But in 2025, it felt like AI popped up more than ever across different games and studios. Swen Vincke, the head ofÂ Baldur’s Gate 3Â maker Larian Studios, stepped into it big time in December after he sounded shockingly bullish on AI generation tools. And Vincke wasn’t alone. Plenty of other video game executives and bosses had lots of positive things to say about AI generation tools. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II director Daniel VÃ¡vra is all for AI usage if it lets his studio make games faster. Chris Cocks, the CEO of D&D parent company Hasbro, said AI is “supercharging fandom.” Nexon CEO Junghun Lee, whose company owns the studio behind Arc Raiders, said in an interview that it’s “important to assume that every game company is now using AI,â and that other companies needed to rely on the tech to “increase [their] competitiveness.” Helldivers 2 boss Shams Jorjani thinks people are being too quick to dismiss AI and called Arc Raiders‘ use of the tech interesting, adding that in his view the tech “actually makes gaming better.â Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino reportedly said that it’s “becoming common sense in the creative world to rely on the power of AI to boost work efficiency.” Level-5 is the studio behind Professor Layton and Ni No Kuni.Â The gung-ho attitude so many gaming execs and bosses have toward gen AI tools likely explains how ugly, wonky AI slop keeps ending up in big video games, including Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7,Â Anno 117: Pax Romana,Â and others. And despite players almost universally being against AI art and other slop, this trend isn’t going away in 2026. PUBG publisher Krafton plans to spend nearly $70 million on becoming an “AI-first” company. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is investing a lot into leveraging the controversial tech into its future video games, even showing off an FPS that was built entirely around AI tech. The shit has even worked its way into stuff like GZDoom and television show recaps. This is our future. It fucking sucks, and until the AI bubble pops, we all will have to put up with more slop in 2026, so greedy execs can make the line go up more by replacing devs and artists with AI chatbots and hoping gamers eventually get over it. It’s never been cheap to play video games. But in 2025, this already expensive hobby became even more pricey. As noted by Stephen Totilo over at Game File, since April, there have been eight price hikes total from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft on consoles, accessories, and subscriptions. This is likely one big reason why console sales were in the gutter in November. And even if you tried to buy a used Xbox or PS5 to save money, it would still likely be more expensive than that same console would have cost at launch in 2020. Meanwhile, Nintendo became the first publisher to break a shocking price barrier when it announced that Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World would be priced at $80. Later, Xbox announced that The Outer Worlds 2 would also be $80, but the backlash was so strong that it relented and lowered the price to $70. However, Xbox didn’t back down on raising prices on Game Pass and turned the service, once called the best deal in gaming by many, intoÂ a more complicated and expensive subscription service. Sony raised prices on PlayStation Plus as well. Perhaps you decide to skip consoles entirely, build a PC, and take advantage of all the great deals on stores like Steam and GOG. Well, thanks to a number of factors, including tech companies gobbling up parts for AI usage and President Trump’s idiotic tariffs, RAM and other PC parts are becoming more and more expensive. And this also means that PC handhelds, like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, will likely cost more when newer versions are announced, and prices on existing models will probably increase. Valve has also announced that it is done making the cheapest version of the Steam Deck, which isn’t good news for folks looking for an affordable and accessible entry into PC gaming. I mean, none of this is good news, and with rumors swirling that next-gen machines will be expensive behemoths, I’d recommend gamers start saving up money as we enter 2026. Itâs been five months since Steam and itch.io began purging certain NSFW games from their storefronts following pressure from payment processors like Mastercard. Despite an immediate backlash and ongoing calls not to let banks censor art, tons of games remain unavailable to purchase on the worldâs biggest PC gaming storefronts. The worst part of all is that itâs still not even clear who the corporate partners are trying to appease with the crackdown. The message to potential censorship advocates is that if you make enough noise, controversy-averse companies will back down. – Ethan Gach Electronic Arts is probably not anyoneâs favorite publisher, given itâs responsible for turning some beloved IPs into live-service slop and gutting certain teams under its umbrella after undermining them for decades, but nobody wants to see a company bought out by the Saudi government. Though EA claims it will maintain creative freedom after the $55 billion deal is signed, sealed, and delivered, all it takes is one person from on high to say that BioWare canât include queer relationships in Mass Effect 5 or that The Sims is now going to focus exclusively on the nuclear family for all of that independence to go away. EA can put on a brave face all it wants, but this is bleak, and a lot of good developers and stories are likely going to suffer for it.Â – Kenneth Shepard There was a lot of buzz around Mindseye, the first game from longtime Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies’ indie video game studio. It was going to be a GTA-like semi-open-world action game that tied into a larger suite of online game creation tools that people could use to build their own experiences, ala Roblox or Fortnite. Instead, what Mindseye ended up being when it launched earlier this year was a complete disaster. It was extremely buggy, ran like crap, was filled with boring missions, and felt sterile and empty. It was easily one of the worst games of the year, and it likely jeopardizes the future of Benzies’ studio and other projects. The Trump administration turning fascist propaganda into the stuff of memes isnât terribly surprising, but itâs disappointing that some of the biggest companies in video games just let him use their IP to do it. Microsoft and The PokÃ©mon Company both saw their creations used in posts from the Trump administration trying to recruit nerds to join ICE, and while The PokÃ©mon Company said it hadn’t given permission for the use of its work, it stopped short of condemning the video post of ICE agents âcatchingâ immigrants set to the iconic anime theme song from the â90s. Microsoft, meanwhile, didnât say a goddamn word. With the current administration being this brain-rotted and online, I imagine most people want to just keep their heads down and not put the spotlight on themselves for longer than they have to. But if Sabrina Carpenter can tell Trump to eat shit, so can you, Master Chief. – Kenneth Shepard 2024 was a bad year for physical media, and 2025 just brought more bad news on that front. Some physical game releases on the Switch 2, the hottest new console around, make use of Game Key Cards, which are basically little pieces of plastic that don’t contain the game, but instead a digital DRM key that lets you download and play a specific game. They rely on the internet and Nintendo’s servers, and that should make everyone nervous. Meanwhile, I walked into a Target to do some Christmas shopping and discovered that my local store has just stopped selling Xbox games. The Outer Worlds 2 skipped a physical Xbox release entirely. And PlayStation made only 3 percent of its total profits in 2024 from physical game sales. Yikes. While physical games aren’t going away entirely in 2026, it does seem like the era of stores filled with aisles of games to buy is long gone. Grand Theft Auto 6, possibly the most highly anticipated video game release in a decade, suffered two more delays in 2025. Originally, Rockstar’s long-awaited open-world crime sim was supposed to launch this year, with many anticipating a fall arrival. But in the spring, the game was delayed until May 2026. Fans were given a second trailer to make up for the delay and marked the new date on their calendars. And then, about six months later, Rockstar announced another delay, pushing GTA 6 back all the way until November 2026. Of course, this wasn’t the most disappointing news to come from Rockstar Games in 2025. No, that would be the union-busting accusations leveled against the company after it fired over two dozen employees for allegedly sharing confidential information on Discord. The staff who were fired deny these allegations and, with the support of the Independent Workersâ Union of Great Britain, continued to protest at Rockstar’s offices. This whole situation has blown up so much that the UK’s Prime Minister has openly called out Rockstar Games and demanded further investigation. It’s clear this isn’t going away like Rockstar Games likely hoped, and when (if?) GTA 6 finally launches in 2026, the company’s firing of these employees will likely be a hot topic among the press and fans. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Share this article BlackRock deposited approximately $200 million in Bitcoin and $29 million in Ethereum into Coinbase Prime on Wednesday, according to Arkham Intelligence data. The transfers coincide with a period of uneven demand for BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where outflows have outweighed inflows in recent weeks. BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) posted around $157 million in net redemptions yesterday, and its Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw an additional $25 million withdrawn, per Farside Investors. The IBIT fund still leads the market for Bitcoin investment products. The Wall Street giant has highlighted Bitcoin as one of its leading investment themes for 2025, alongside T-bills and major tech stocks. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Timothée Chalamet, a Neil Diamond tribute band and more in theaters for Christmas
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/12/24/nx-s1-5649826/marty-supreme-song-sung-blue-the-choral-the-plague

By Bob Mondello , Stephen Thompson Timothée Chalamet in Marty Supreme. A24 hide caption A ping pong hustler for the ages, a Neil Diamond interpreter for the '80s, choral music both comic and spiritual, plus tormented teens, twisted families, and a giant snake on the loose. It's quite the jolly holiday at your local cineplex. They join a new Avatar sequel, a Bradley Cooper-directed drama, and more in theaters. In theaters Thursday I feel as if I should tell you to speed-read this review, preferably with Fats Domino's "The Fat Man" blaring in your ear. Josh Safdie's adrenaline-fueled, screwball comedy about a table tennis hustler who dreams of world domination — in a sport that hasn't registered yet with the American public — is a mesmerizing cinematic tour de force. Timothée Chalamet plays Marty Mauser (loosely based on real-life 1940s and '50s U.S. ping pong champ and petty criminal Marty Reisman), graduating from determined kid-with-a-passion to aggrieved also-ran-in-full-melt-down mode, attracting and then alienating everyone he comes across. We meet him as a New York shoe salesman having storeroom trysts with his married childhood sweetheart (Odessa A'zion) and prepping for a bout in England for which he can't even afford plane fare. Marty establishes with a series of heists and scams that he's got no problem cheating or stealing to get there, then regales the press with a pugnacious racist routine that lands him on front pages before his first serve. Chalamet's live-wire approach is neatly countered by a serenely sensual turn by Gwyneth Paltrow as an aging movie star who finds Marty amusing and alarming in about equal measure. And the film's just getting started at that point, careening towards a championship in Japan with the propulsive, harrowing, rush-to-judgment feel of Safdie's Uncut Gems mixed up with dizzying comedy. It's a thrill ride, pure and simple. — Bob Mondello In theaters Thursday Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life, blue-collar Milwaukee couple who formed a Neil Diamond tribute act in the 1980s, get the sequin-and-spangle treatment in this Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson love-fest. Writer and director Craig Brewer keeps the music central and the sentiment tolerable as the couple meets cute, bonds quick, and forms a musical act known professionally as Lightning and Thunder. The stars are well-matched and appealing — Hudson does a winning Patsy Cline impersonation, and Jackman completely nails Neil Diamond's sound and bearing. The couple's story, which has more downs than ups, doesn't quite match the mood of a movie determined to be ever-and-always-up. Still, the stars are engaging, the supporting cast great fun, and the music rousing. — Bob Mondello Whether you plan to head out to the theater or binge from the couch, our critics have gathered together their favorite films and TV shows of 2025. In theaters Thursday The original Anaconda movie came out almost 30 years ago, sending an assortment of '90s movie stars down the Amazon, where they were menaced and occasionally crushed and/or devoured by giant deadly snakes. That film, starring Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube, was a hit that spawned a handful of lightly regarded sequels. Heavy on meta references to the original film, the new Anaconda is not quite a reboot, it's not quite a sequel, and it's played for laughs. Jack Black and Paul Rudd star as lifelong friends who grew up wanting to be filmmakers. But they've followed different career paths — Paul Rudd's character is a struggling actor whose biggest role was a bit part on the TV show S.W.A.T., while Jack Black's character makes wedding videos while yearning to shoot something more creative. They gather their old friends and collaborators — played by Thandiwe Newton and Steve Zahn — and head to the Amazon to shoot a meta reimagining of Anaconda. As you can imagine, this proves harder than it sounds. — Stephen Thompson In limited theaters Wednesday The first image is an eerie, underwater shot — sun-dappled blues, greens, and greys — its peace suddenly exploded as bodies plunge into the pool. Middle school boys, limbs all akimbo, almost literally at sea, as they struggle for equilibrium. It's an apt beginning for the story of a youngster trying to figure out where he fits in among the cliques at a summer water polo camp. Ben (Everett Blunck) is the camp newbie, Jake (Kayo Martin) its smirking cool kid who picks up on his fellow campers' idiosyncrasies and exploits them. He tells Ben that Eli (Kenny Rasmussen), a withdrawn boy with a rash, has the "plague" and must be avoided. Ben, seeing the obvious pain the outcast is in, can't square that with his own sense of decency, but also doesn't want to be ostracized, and his attempt to split the difference leads the film into Lord of the Flies territory. Charlie Polinger's directorial debut looks breathtaking, feels unnerving, and traffics cleverly in body-horror tropes as it basically establishes that 12-year-old boys are savages who should never be without adult supervision. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Wednesday You might expect Jim Jarmusch to look at family relationships with a certain eccentricity, but not necessarily in the elegantly framed way he does in this triptych about adult children and the parents they don't begin to understand. The Father segment casts Adam Driver and Mayim Bialik as siblings who are stiff with each other, and even less comfortable with their garrulous con man of a dad (Tom Waits). Driver's come with provisions and cash, Bialik's come armed with an arched eyebrow, and Waits is ready for them both. The second part, Mother, finds a sublimely chilly Charlotte Rampling hosting an awkward once-a-year tea for her daughters, one primly nervous (Cate Blanchett), the other pink-haired and boisterous (Vicky Krieps). And the final third, Sister Brother, finds Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat bonding in their recently deceased parents' now-empty Paris apartment. This segment seems less about estrangement, until you realize how little they actually know about their dear departed folks. There are running jokes about Rolexes, the expression "Bob's your uncle," and toasts to tie things together, along with a sweet, reflective tone that makes this one of the year's most compassionate films. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Thursday Director Nicholas Hytner and screenwriter Alan Bennett, who previously teamed up on The Madness of King George, The History Boys, and The Lady in the Van, are plumbing shallower depths in this gentle dramedy about an amateur chorus in 1916. When their choirmaster leaves to fight in World War I, grieving mill owner Roger Allam, who funds the chorus, reluctantly hires Dr. Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes), a gifted choirmaster but a divisive choice in this intensely nationalistic moment — because he's spent the last few years in Germany. He also exhibits "peculiarities" (code for being gay) but this seems less important to the locals. Fiennes is briskly dismissive of local traditions, snippy about English appreciation for the arts, and celebrated enough in music circles to persuade composer Edward Elgar (Simon Russell Beale) to let them perform his oratorio "The Dream of Gerontius." Elgar is less thrilled when he discovers the chorus is turning the oratorio into a story about the war, casting its elderly hero as a young soldier and generally making it what later generations would call "relevant." It's all sweet and sentimental, and though it's being released during awards seasons, feels as if it really wants to be considered for best picture of 1933. — Bob Mondello In select theaters Thursday "I've got it all," says paper factory supervisor Man-su as he hugs his family at a barbecue in the backyard of his elegant Korean home. He's grilling some eels given to him by the paper company's new American owners, secure in the knowledge that this must mean they value him. This being a social satire by director Park Chan-wook, it's reasonable to expect he will shortly be dealt a blow, and one day later, he's been axed. (The film is based on Donald E. Westlake's 1997 horror-thriller novel The Ax). He's distraught but can't express, or even really understand, that he feels he has lost his manhood, his mojo, and his reason for being. On top of that, his industry is consolidating, so finding another job before his severance pay runs out and he loses his house (his childhood home) will be tricky. Asked if he'd consider a job outside the paper industry, Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) says that for him there is "no other choice," echoing the words his American bosses uttered about bringing down costs as they did layoffs. But with the end of severance payments looming, he hatches a plan to knock off his job market competition one by one. Isn't this mass murder? Well, he has "no other choice." At first it seems as if we're in serial-killer comedy territory, but the filmmaker widens the frame to include narrative side trips — a stepson who's stealing cellphones, a daughter who's a cello prodigy, a wife who's working for a dentist that Man-su suspects has designs on her. Oh, and pig-farm trauma from his youth, and a passion for greenhouse gardening. Director Park has a lot going on, and a final paper-plant-mechanization sequence suggests that all these stabs at human agency may just have been humanity's last gasp. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Thursday Ambitious, stylized, intense, and thoroughly unorthodox, Mona Fastvold's religious biopic tells the story of Shakers founder Ann Lee (a wild-eyed, fiercely committed Amanda Seyfried) as a full-scale musical drama. That's not to say there are finger-snapping tunes. The score adapts 18th century Shaker spirituals, and the choreography involves the thrusting limbs and clawing fingers of the seizure-like dancing that earned this puritan sect of "Shaking" Quakers their nickname. We meet Ann as a pious youngster more interested in spiritual matters than matters of the flesh. Marriage to a man who enjoys inflicting pain during sex, and the deaths of her four children in infancy lead Ann to the conclusion that lifelong celibacy is among the keys to salvation. With the help of her younger brother (Lewis Pullman), she finds adherents to a religious philosophy that also emphasizes gender equality and simple living, and leads them to found a utopian, crafts-based community in America. Director Fastvold and her co-writer Brady Corbet (the couple flipped roles from last year's The Brutalist) serve up Ann's spiritual journey in ecstatically musical terms, which is at once distancing and … well, ecstatic, though it pales a bit over the course of two-and-a-quarter hours. — Bob Mondello Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: YieldMax® ETFs Announces Weekly Distributions for Group 2 ETFs

December 24, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® ETFs today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Group 2 weekly pay ETFs. Group 2 Distribution Announcement Ex. & Record Date: December 26, 2025Payment Date: December 29, 2025 Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968. For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 23, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © chayanuphol / Shutterstock.com There is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago. Most importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged. This indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn’t flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market’s overall value. While history doesn’t always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is. The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about. For companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA’s data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft’s AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue. This technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7’s technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages. The optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won’t have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations. This pattern of pricing in future success isn’t new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it’s how you’re reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality. The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak. The last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover. The CAPE ratio’s predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment. What makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn’t just existing in a silo. Instead, it’s appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched. History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we’re going through now with AI. For investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn’t recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested. Building a cash reserve now so investors can “buy the dip,” as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven’t experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size. The key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn’t the actual decline itself, it’s the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it’s going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade’s best returns.

Good morning. The holidays feel like a good time to check in with Ariane Gorin, CEO of Expedia Group. 2025 has been a banner year for travel and for Expedia, which saw its revenues rise 7.6% to $13.4 billion in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with its stock up more than 50% so far this year. In the latest episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next, Gorin spoke to me and Kristin Stoller about the evolving travel landscape and how she’s leading in this tricky climate. AI is reshaping the travel experience as many of us turn to large language models to plan and even pay for trips. That presents both an opportunity and a potential threat for leaders like Gorin—and Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel, with whom we spoke earlier this year. The opportunity: to deploy AI internally and forge partnerships that embed the group’s Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo functionality within the LLMs. The risk: hallucinations, privacy violations, and the specter of LLMs reducing the need for travel sites or turning them into invisible pipes that consumers never see. “We’ve been working for years with Google and Bing … and now it’s about deepening our partnerships,” said Gorin, adding that AI has enabled innovation like Expedia’s new trip-matching feature that turns Instagram reels into bookable travel experiences. “It’s been quite fun to challenge ourselves to say, ‘how do we make sure that our brands are showing up well there?’” Gorin also talks about building up Brand USA among foreigners during this delicate time when former stalwarts (hello, Canada!) may be staying away and events from the World Cup to America’s 250th anniversary are expected to boost tourism. Her approach is to start with telling the story that Americans are “making it welcoming, that we’re making the infrastructure welcoming, we’re making it easy to come to the country.” That’s a message many leaders would love to rally around. You can listen to our conversation on Apple or Spotify. Also, the CEO Daily team is taking a break for the holidays. See you back here on January 5. As always, we welcome your thoughts and appreciate you reading what we write.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S. sends more troops to the Caribbean Large numbers of ships, special-operations aircraft, troops, and equipment are being amassed by the U.S. military in the Caribbean in a buildup to a potential attack on Venezuela, which may include airstrikes on Venezuelan soil. “We have a massive armada formed, the biggest we’ve ever had, and by far the biggest we’ve ever had in South America,” President Trump said. “Soon we will be starting the same program on land.” Trump wants to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro out of office. Trump flew on Epstein’s plane more often than thought The U.S. Justice Department released thousands more documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, and many made mention of President Donald Trump. None of them describe wrongdoing. But one email, from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, said flight records showed Trump used Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).” There are 700,000 more pages of Epstein material on the way—so expect the headlines on this issue to last another week. Epstein sought Wall Street giants as executors of his will The Epstein documents show that the late financier hoped that high-powered Wall Street execs would be the executors of his estate. He named Jimmy Cayne, the former CEO of Bear Stearns; Jes Staley, formerly of JPMorgan and an ex-CEO of Barclays, Goldman Sachs legal chief Kathryn Ruemmler, and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as executors in various versions of his will. It is not clear that any of them knew they were named by Epstein. Big Tech companies have $120 billion in off-balance sheet debt Meta, xAI, Oracle, CoreWeave and others have moved $120 billion in spending on AI data centers off their balance sheets and into special-purpose vehicles or private credit entities funded by Pimco, BlackRock, Apollo, Blue Owl Capital , JPMorgan, and others, according to a Financial Times analysis. U.S. GDP fueled mostly by AI U.S. GDP grew 4.3% in Q3, far surpassing expectations, but most of that growth comes from one thing: AI data centers. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that private fixed investment—a measure of how much companies are spending—“is rising only due to AI-related spending.” All other private fixed investment is actually in decline. Deutsche Bank said, “Investment in AI-related sectors is critical to GDP growth [and the] U.S. would be close to recession this year if it weren’t for tech-related spending.” Trump Administration bans former EU commissioner from entering the U.S. Thierry Breton, the former European Union commissioner who backed the Digital Services Act, and four anti-disinformation campaigners have been banned from entering the U.S. “The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. The DSA bans U.S. tech platforms from targeting users with data based on gender, race, religion, or age. Targeting children with ads will also be prohibited. It also requires platforms to take down content that incites terrorism or child sexual abuse. Progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks Ukraine’s President Zelensky is hopeful he can persuade the U.S. to support a proposal that would halt Russia’s war along the current contact lines. Russia has suggested it could pull back troops from some areas, Zelensky said, but Ukraine is reluctant to cede territory it controls. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning.

Title: Crypto Won In 2025—But Bitcoin Fell. Can They Rise to the Occasion?

The rise and subsequent retreat of bitcoin perfectly encapsulates the crypto industry's year. It won big—but it doesn't have much to show for it yet. The price of bitcoin, the world's most well-known cryptocurrency, soared above $126,000, a record, but those gains evaporated and it's poised to finish down for 2025. The industry welcomed the passage of stablecoin legislation, eased regulation, and the proliferation of new ways to buy in, but by many measures it has yet to reap the benefits. Despite all this, plenty of reasons for optimism regarding the both sector and the currencies themselves remain. Next year could be when the effects of institutional buy-in and regulatory shift will start to show, crypto watchers say. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) could break out of its rut to book new highs, experts say, while altcoins could get a regulatory boost. And interest in "tokens"—the digital representation of assets like the dollar or stocks—could take off, further extending the investing world into digital space. "If you talk to retail crypto, the vibe is extraordinarily negative. They look at their world, which extends out a few weeks in time, and see dark clouds—and so they're selling," Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management told Investopedia. "And then if you talk to institutional investors, they're just unremittingly bullish." The crypto industry has said that regulation was holding back its potential and that it would upend and replace the existing financial system. Now that a crypto-friendly administration has paved the way, investors are waiting for some of those promised developments to be realized. Bitcoin's supporters see reasons for optimism in the broader outlook for markets in 2026. The prospect of lower interest rates is generally beneficial to risk assets and could both fuel retail appetite for and institutional investor interest in crypto. The coming wave of capital implied by major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch offering access to crypto ETFs to their clients, and big university endowments like those of Harvard and Brown buying in, could also lift bitcoin next year, Hougan said. He expects institutional demand to outpace new supply in the years to come. Since crypto ETFs launched in 2024, they have bought more than 700,000 bitcoin, roughly twice the number of new coins produced by the Bitcoin network over the same period, according to a Bitwise report. The so-called debasement trade—in which investors seek hedges, such as crypto or other assets, against high government debt and a declining dollar—may also come back into play, drawing investor interest next year. "For individuals investing against or hedging their debasement risk, bitcoin makes a lot of sense," Amberdata's director of derivatives Greg Magadini said. Bitcoin's permabulls broadly expect prices to continue to go higher—if not next year, then by the end of the decade. Standard Chartered, for example, sees it hitting $500,000 by 2030. The nearer term outlook for the cryptocurrency, however, is muddier. Galaxy Digital, a financial services firm focused on digital assets, in its 2026 outlook said bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of 2027 but called next year "too chaotic to predict." (That generally tracks with the outlooks of some stock-focused analysts, who think the S&P could rise next year but perhaps not smoothly.) Enthusiasm for crypto has led related businesses to stock exchanges amid a revival in initial public offerings. Their collective performance was mixed: Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) hit it big and retained some of its early-won gains, as did Bullish (BLSH). But shares of Winklevoss twins-founded crypto platform Gemini (GEMI) have fallen substantially below their IPO price. (A few well-known firms are eyeing a debut next year.) Strategy (MSTR), the software company that put itself on the map by stockpiling bitcoin, tumbled more than 45% year-to-date. The passage of the CLARITY Act, which provides a framework for regulating crypto in the same way the GENIUS Act did for stablecoins, could also support crypto. David Sacks, the White House's adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence, has said "we are closer than ever" to passing the bill. If the bill is signed into law, the outlook for crypto would improve, Hougan said, because it would enshrine the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, as crypto's oversight agency, considered the industry's preferred outcome. If it doesn't, a less crypto-friendly future administration might take a different approach. The CLARITY Act would set a more solid regulatory foundation for the industry to operate, according to Hougan, and potentially invigorate demand for altcoins like ether and sol. "It's the biggest risk to crypto right now," he said. "People are pricing in a higher probability that market structure legislation won't get passed." Tokens tied to real-world assets, like stablecoins or ones linked to stocks, could also fire up interest in crypto next year, with some crypto experts saying they can can improve the functioning of the financial system. Circle in 2025 saw its USDC stablecoin expand its reach, with its circulating supply jumping more than 50%, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently predicted that tokenization could transform the financial market sooner rather than later. "It's the way the world will be...maybe not even in 10 years, maybe even a lot less time, maybe a couple of years from now," Atkins told Fox Business. The tokenization of stocks, an opportunity potentially measured in the trillions of dollars, is being tackled by crypto players and at least one of the financial industry's juggernauts. Coinbase Global (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange, which recently unveiled its own token platform (as well as stock trading), and BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, have both made tokenization a strategic priority.

Title: ‘If I can help someone, I will’: the Dublin woman who has been providing Christmas dinners for 39 years

“I won’t be here forever and these people cannot be left without,” said Dubliner Margaret Brown, who has been providing Christmas dinners to those in need and the homeless for almost four decades. Mrs Brown, from Sandycove in south Co Dublin, has been organising the festive feast since 1986 after she and her late mother saw people in a scout hall eating lumpy soup and cold meat while huddled around a gas-fired heater. “Running out of turkey 39 years ago when I first started cooking dinners with my mother, I never thought I would be doing this all these years later,” she said. “But thankfully I can still do this; for how much longer I do not know.” Mrs Brown, who is in her 80s, originally organised her annual Christmas dinners in Blackrock Rugby Club in south Dublin. In the past, high-profile names such as rock band U2 have surprised guests at the annual Christmas dinner when people gathered at the rugby club. Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything and forced Mrs Brown and scores of volunteers to turn to making takeout meals instead. Now the new tradition of delivering the five-course feast of a full Christmas dinner, with pudding and mince pies, is here to stay. “I won’t be here forever, but I’ll keep making the dinners with the help of so many wonderful volunteers thanks to donations we receive from food producers,” said Mrs Brown. The numbers she is feeding have surpassed 200, which is normally the cut-off number she and her team can cook for. “The numbers we could provide for filled our list way in advance of the cut-off date,” she said. “There are so many new people, many of whom are younger, not just older individuals who are lonely and homeless, which is shocking.” The 39 years she has been feeding people has passed “in the blink of an eye” and the needs of people have changed in that time. “There have been a lot of changes in social needs over those years and food provisions have to meet those demands,” she said. The team of volunteers will be cooking for 60 people living in Bethany House for the homeless in Dún Laoghaire. There will also be a special meal for Travellers living in Carrickmines who lost several family members in a blaze 10 years ago. [ ‘So long as these people are here, we’ll never starve’: In the queue for Christmas vouchers at Dublin’s Capuchin Day CentreOpens in new window ] “It takes a lot of preparation in the lead-up to Christmas Day, receiving donations, streamlining of cooking times, delivering the food to people, or them calling to the rugby club at specific times and ensuring no one is forgotten,” said Mrs Brown. Her giving has not just been at Christmas. In 2019 she helped repatriate the remains of an Irishman, Joseph Tuohy from Toomevara, Co Tipperary, as he had no known relatives still alive, and helped prepare a funeral for him. Mr Tuohy, who died in his late 80s, was separated from his mother at age five and spent his childhood in orphanages and St Joseph’s Industrial School in Clonmel. He emigrated to London in his late teens and never returned to Ireland, losing contact with his family. He experienced periods of homelessness and illness in London. Mrs Brown was contacted about his case in her capacity as a volunteer for the Friends of the Forgotten Irish Emigrants, who launched an appeal to Mr Tuohy’s relatives and for people to attend his funeral. His ashes were subsequently laid in consecrated ground in Tipperary. “I didn’t set out for my life to be like this, or to become known for trying to help others, but life can be so difficult for so many and if I can help someone I will,” said Mrs Brown.

Title: Extended crypto ETF outflows shows institutions disengaging: Glassnode

Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have recorded sustained outflows since early November, which Glassnode says signals institutional disengagement. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds have seen a prolonged streak of outflows, indicating that institutional investors have disengaged with crypto, said the analytics platform Glassnode. Since early November, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs has turned negative, Glassnode said on Tuesday. “This persistence suggests a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market,” it added. Flows into crypto ETFs usually lag the spot markets for the tokens, which have been trending down since mid-October. The ETFs are also considered a bellwether for institutional sentiment, which has been a market driver for most of this year but seemingly turned bearish as the wider market has contracted. Coinglass said aggregate Bitcoin ETF flows have been in the red for the past four consecutive trading days. However, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen minor inflows over the past week. “Crypto ETF selling pressure is back,” the Kobeissi Letter said on Tuesday. It reported that crypto funds recorded $952 million in outflows last week, and investors have now withdrawn capital in six out of the last ten weeks. Related: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks Despite the recent outflows, the industry-dominant BlackRock fund has seen $62.5 billion in inflows since inception, eclipsing all rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Saturday that IBIT is the only ETF on Bloomberg’s “2025 Flow Leaderboard” with a negative return for the year. “The real takeaway is that it was sixth place despite the negative return,” he added. Balchunas said that BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin fund even took in more than the SPDR Gold Shares fund (GLD), which was up 64%.

Title: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP, currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently fallen below the crucial $2 mark amid a broader market correction that has dampened investor sentiment since October. However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year.

Two new exchange-traded funds from Amplify track companies building the infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenization, blending stocks and crypto. Cointelegraph in your social feed Digital asset manager Amplify has launched two exchange-traded funds tracking blockchain projects across stablecoins and tokenization. The company said on Tuesday that its Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) both went live on the NYSE Arca exchange. Both funds track a diversified index of companies working on products or infrastructure, along with projects that generate revenue from tokenization and stablecoins. “These new ETFs expand Amplify’s lineup at a time when the infrastructure behind stablecoins and the growth of tokenization are shaping the next phase of digital finance,” the company said. Stablecoins and tokenization have been among the most popular themes in crypto this year, with the US passing laws that have given institutions confidence to launch stablecoins, and regulators opening dialogue on how they should treat assets such as tokenized stocks. Amplify said its stablecoin-focused ETF tracks shares of companies “generating significant revenue from payments technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms.” It holds shares in companies working on stablecoins such as Visa, Circle, Mastercard and PayPal, alongside crypto ETFs from Grayscale, iShares and Bitwise. The firm pointed to regulatory developments in the US and EU, noting that the “GENIUS Act in the US and MiCA in Europe are positioning stablecoins as the compliant backbone of digital finance.” Related: Clarity Act delays led to $952M in crypto fund outflows: CoinShares Meanwhile, the tokenization fund includes exposure to BlackRock, JPMorgan, Figure Technology Solution, Citigroup and the Nasdaq, which all have made tokenization plays over the past few years as they seek opportunities to digitize traditional financial services. Crypto and blockchain ETFs stormed onto the market in 2025 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission under chair Paul Atkins loosened requirements for crypto ETFs.

JPMorgan is making another big bet on crypto. The Wall Street giant is considering letting institutional clients trade cryptocurrency, according to reporting on Monday from Bloomberg. These products and services may reportedly include spot and derivatives trading, and the efforts are still in their early stages. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The move comes amid the company’s broader embrace of digital assets. In October, the bank announced that it would allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral. And earlier in December, JPMorgan’s asset management arm launched its first tokenized money fund. The bank’s recent expansion of crypto is notable given how CEO Jamie Dimon has long expressed contempt for the sector. As recently as last year, Dimon compared Bitcoin to a “pet rock”, and said that its only uses were for money laundering and fraud, among other illegal activities. The remarks followed other insults Dimon has heaped on crypto over the years. JPMorgan’s pivot towards crypto follows President Donald Trump’s more favorable policies toward the sector. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation was enacted as Trump’s family profited from the industry. Given the new regulatory landscape for crypto, other major financial companies have also been hopping on the bandwagon. BlackRock manages close to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $11 billion in Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, fellow financial giant Fidelity is involved in crypto staking, while Goldman Sachs has a private blockchain that is testing tokenized fund redemptions. And UBS, Citi, and HSBC have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and crypto custody services. Wall Street’s latest digital asset adoption has not, however, translated to big price wins for the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down about 30% to roughly $87,000 since its high of $126,000 in early October. Ethereum is also down roughly 30% in the last three months to $2,919, and Solana is down roughly 43% to $123.07 during that same time period. It appears that the big banks are taking a long-term view on crypto and are not being scared off by this recent dip.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Advanced Micro Devices Over the next decade, you’ll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market’s darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Even though it’s a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks. This isn’t to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we’ll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential. One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn’t pay a dividend. Consequently, you’ll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit. Meanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices’ valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x. In addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock’s price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices. Those are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here. Besides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don’t have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let’s perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices’ financial health. Advanced Micro Devices’ high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you’ll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don’t own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years. All in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company’s results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025. Impressively, Advanced Micro Devices’ net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices’ Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales. Turning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices’ net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company’s cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that’s on a powerful growth trajectory. While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices’ business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China’s chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ MI308 AI accelerators. This is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there. Advanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China. Also, it’s a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They “exchanged views on the company’s business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,” according to the ‍ministry. Sure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China’s chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company’s progress in this region. In contrast, Advanced Micro Devices’ growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China. In the final analysis, there’s no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk. While Advanced Micro Devices doesn’t pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there’s an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Advanced Micro Devices Over the next decade, you’ll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market’s darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Even though it’s a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks. This isn’t to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we’ll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential. One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn’t pay a dividend. Consequently, you’ll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit. Meanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices’ valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x. In addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock’s price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices. Those are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here. Besides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don’t have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let’s perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices’ financial health. Advanced Micro Devices’ high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you’ll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don’t own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years. All in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company’s results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025.

Title: AI Gets the Blame for 55,000 Layoffs in 2025

Reading time 2 minutes Companies cut about 1.1 million jobs this year, the most since the covid-19 pandemic. However, the notion that those layoffs are occurring due to technological advancements, as if the majority of those roles are now filled by artificial intelligence, doesn’t quite align with the data. According to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, about 55,000 layoffs were attributed directly to AIâless than 1% of all job losses. One industry where layoffs were common this year was tech, with many of the Big Tech firms cutting off large chunks of their workforce. Those often came with platitudes about streamlining and modernizing roles, with vague gestures toward the idea that AI will be stepping in. As Amazon started preparing to lay off workers in June, CEO Andy Jassy told employees that AI would mean the company would âneed fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” But in October, after cutting 14,000 people loose, Jassy told investors the decision was “not even really AI driven, not right now at least.” That’s not to say the introduction of AI hasn’t truly cost people jobs. Corporations like Salesforce, for instance, have gleefully sent humans home and started to make claims that as much as 50% of all work is now completed by AI. But if AI has had an effect on the workforce, it seems like it isn’t directly causing layoffs but is instead blocking new hires. Not only are people losing work, but companies also aren’t hiringâand entry-level roles in particular have been hard hit by the misguided idea that their roles can be filled by AI. Meanwhile, an MIT study published this summer found that 95% of organizations that have launched AI initiatives have seen zero financial return on their investment. The layoffs that have hit workers are real, of course. But AI may simply be a useful scapegoat for companies that want to appear like they are embracing automation and being forward-thinking when the reality is they either overhired in recent years while the economy was booming and now want to cut back as profit margins get thinner, or have been extremely hard hit by a turbulent economy plagued by the Trump administration’s tariff regime. The manufacturing industry, which should be booming with the massive data center construction projects cropping up across the country, has lost nearly 60,000 jobs since the start of the year. It’s not AI taking those roles. In the same Challenger, Gray and Christmas report that shows 55,000 jobs were lost directly to AI, more than twice as many were attributed to restructuring, about four times as many were blamed on market and economic conditions, and nearly six times as many were chalked up to cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency and the downstream impact of those decisions. It’s a good reminder that even when AI is attributed as the reason for a job cut, the decision was made by an executive who has done the math and determined that axing human labor in the name of “modernization” will likely boost the stock price.

Title: Microsoft bets on cloud and cross-platform future for Xbox while brushing off 30% profit margin rumors

Microsoft has denied recent reports claiming that it imposed a strict 30% profit margin on its Xbox gaming division. The company said it aims high, but didn’t provide an exact profit margin figure. Microsoft pushed back against the claims in a new CNBC interview, where the company discussed the challenges and rumors that arose over the past year, including numerous layoffs and project cancellations. Previously, a Bloomberg story in October reported that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has set a 30% profit goal as part of “accountability margins,” with Xbox in particular feeling the pressure. Many industry insiders whispered similar information, which was acknowledged as the primary driver of Microsoft’s cost-cutting measures, including scrapping various projects and reducing headcount. The 30% figure stood out because it’s well above typical profit margins in the gaming industry, which are reported to range from 17% to 22%. Xbox’s own margins were 12% in 2022, according to earlier documentation. Microsoft spoke to CNBC directly and said, “While the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.” Xbox’s hurdles have been piling up, with over 9,000 employees affected across multiple rounds of layoffs. Numerous big-budget projects were axed in the wake of Microsoft’s layoffs, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark Reboot, Rare’s long-in-development Everwild, and ZeniMax Online’s sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird. Furthermore, Xbox sales have taken a nosedive, with a whopping 70% drop in November, putting the company far behind Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Nintendo’s Switch 2 in hardware sales. Xbox also announced last week that it wouldn’t be implementing the Xbox Wrapped feature this year due to budget constraints. Reports claim that Xbox is shifting funds toward its 25th anniversary celebration in 2026. However, it still shows that the company is under financial pressure. Despite all these challenges and setbacks, Microsoft is still pursuing and pivoting towards cloud gaming and cross-platform gaming, Xbox Game Pass subscription, and is forgoing exclusivity to allow more players to join Xbox’s gaming endeavors, ranging from PCs, handhelds like the Rog Ally and Ally X, mobile devices, and even automobiles. As for Bloomberg, it’s not yet clear if the news outlet will retract its statement, update its report, or provide further information regarding the matter. Buy Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on Amazon CNBC

Title: Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world’s second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street. There are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI “replacing” the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals. Let’s take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026. Google was supposed to “die” after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can. Then, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI “Bard” rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in “code red” mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards. If you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI’s sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each. If you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI’s GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models. Alphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn’t spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have gone into net debt. If Google’s rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated. As for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with. In contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it. Software isn’t Alphabet’s only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia’s near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient. Meta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth “billions of dollars,” with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia’s coffers instead. The threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google’s AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating. I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world’s largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030. Nvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: The 120 Most Powerful Executives in Entertainment, Ranked

In business, the power of individual leaders is an inherently hard thing to measure. It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions. To commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood. After months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment. Notice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming. We intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news. When you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line. Also, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion. We also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options. Variety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here. Listen to “Daily Variety” podcast: Showbiz news and analysis tailored for industry insiders. Spoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs. We noticed that from our internet traffic and by the growing number of markets and festivals that we cover in the region. We made this choice to bookend the list with a signpost of the future and an example of the reach and influence of movies, TV, music and games. From our very first issue, published Dec. 16, 1905, much of Variety’s focus has been on the people who work behind the scenes to make things happen for those who take the stage. We hope this list can be a scorecard for readers who, like the staff of Variety, are eager to see what comes next for our fascinating industry in 2026 and beyond. Profiles written by Jem Aswad, Matt Donnelly, Steven J. Horowitz, Angelique Jackson, Elsa Keslassy, Brent Lang, Cynthia Littleton, Jennifer Maas, Naman Ramachandran, Rebecca Rubin, Michael Schneider, Todd Spangler, Brian Steinberg and Nick Vivarelli. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Sarandos got his start in the entertainment biz working at a video-rental store as a teen. He’s now one of the most powerful content executives in Hollywood, rubbing elbows with celebs, showrunners, directors and other creatives who make content (or want to) for Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers worldwide. He’s overseen all content operations at the company since 2000, when it was still a DVD-by-mail outfit, and has had his hand on the steering wheel throughout its monumental rise. Sarandos led Netflix’s move into original content starting with the 2013 launch of “House of Cards.” He has famously called the moviegoing experience “outdated,” irking not just theater owners but filmmakers. In a reflection of Netflix’s clout, Sarandos has made a serious bid to acquire the Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Even if Netflix doesn’t win, Sarandos is showing that the company is definitely playing in the big leagues. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The more that Comcast pushes onto Langley’s plate, the more she rises to the challenge. As NBCUniversal and other top traditional media companies focus on the power of big events to draw large audiences, Langley must translate her success with content franchises into devising spectacles that bring people to screens all at the same time. Look for NBCU to celebrate more anniversaries like the 50th anniversary of “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s centennial in the months to come. She must also help stock the pipeline with new content favorites that draw viewers to the Peacock streaming service as well as traditional TV. After a sweeping reorganization of NBCUniversal in 2024, Langley controls greenlights across the entire enterprise, overseeing programming, marketing, distribution, acquisitions and operations for the film and TV studios, the linear network, Peacock and Bravo. Her trademark poise served her well through the M&A noise of 2025, delivering consistent support for creatives. Langley’s beloved film studio Universal Pictures, her training ground, look to blow the doors off of 2026 with releases from Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg, as well as animated sequels in the “Minions” and “Super Mario Bros.” franchises. Title: Chairman and CEO, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ellison has a network of influential friends and family, starting with his ultra-wealthy dad, Oracle mogul Larry Ellison. After a career as a film producer with hits that included Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” Ellison donned the mantle of media mogul. He led Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, bankrolled by his father and RedBird Capital Partners — a deal that met with the approval of Donald Trump and his administration. After installing a mostly new management team, Ellison’s early moves at the new Paramount Skydance have included inking a rich deal for UFC rights and the acquisition of Bari Weiss’s The Free Press (with Weiss installed as editor-in-chief of CBS News). Ellison is now looking consolidate more power in Hollywood: He’s in the thick of a public brawl with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, pitting him against Netflix. The sale process is turning in to a referendum on the future of Hollywood. Title: CEO, YouTube Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Mohan is a Silicon Valley exec with a chill vibe — who runs a media business estimated to rival Disney by revenue, as YouTube reinforces its pole position as the most-streamed service on TVs in the U.S. That stunning stat surely helped YouTube land the TV rights deal that shocked Hollywood: The annual Oscars kudocast will move to YouTube starting in 2029 with the 101st Academy Awards ceremony. It’s been a busy few years on the job for Mohan, who assumed the chief exec role in 2023 after serving as YouTube’s chief product officer. He joined Google with its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007. In addition to overseeing YouTube’s significant core ads business, Mohan has been driving growth of the platform’s subscriptions businesses, including YouTube TV. With more than 10 million pay-TV subscribers, YouTube was in a position to flex its market power in programming renewals in 2025 — and its tough negotiating tactics led to blackouts of Disney and Univision nets before the parties reached deals. Mohan is now setting YouTube’s AI agenda, balancing concerns of Hollywood players with the rollout of powerful new content tools for its millions of creators. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: One of the most powerful and well-regarded execs in TV, Walden leads Disney’s portfolio of entertainment media, news and content businesses worldwide, and has shared oversight of Disney+ and Hulu with Alan Bergman. Under her leadership, ABC has been the No. 1 entertainment network for four straight seasons and ABC News has topped its rivals — impressive achievements even as linear TV continues to decline. Over the years, Walden has had indisputable success in television, overseeing such hits as “24,” “Glee,” “Modern Family,” “Homeland,” “This Is Us” and more recently, “Abbott Elementary,” “High Potential,” “Paradise,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Kardashians” and more. Before joining Disney, she rose through the ranks at the Fox studio and network. Now she’s on the short list to succeed Bob Iger at the helm of Disney next year. This fall, Walden faced a test with ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel amid a right-wing backlash over his comments about Charlie Kirk’s murder. After a PR storm, she brought Kimmel back and got two big affiliate groups to resume airing his show. She was also in the thick of Disney’s two-week battle with YouTube in November over a carriage agreement. Title: CEO, Disney Held job since: 2022 (was CEO from 2005-20) Sources of power: Iger is on his second farewell tour as leader of the Magic Kingdom, with the 74-year-old executive’s contract expiring in December 2026 — and Disney’s board poised to name a successor early next year. But even as a lame-duck CEO, Iger remains a powerful force in media and entertainment. Following Iger’s return as chief exec in late 2022 in the wake of Disney’s first try at finding an Iger successor did not take. Since his return, Iger has reinvigorated Disney’s movie studios and overseen the theme park and cruise biz’s recovery from the COVID crash. Iger has moved to combine Disney+ and Hulu (after closing the buyout of Comcast’s Hulu stake) into a supercharged unified streamer while finally launching a streaming-only version of ESPN. The stock hasn’t recovered from its streaming-bubble highs, but Iger has proven a deft manager of the global entertainment conglomerate’s many moving pieces. Even as he says goodbye — after postponing his retirement five times! — Iger will have a part in the selection of the next CEO. Title: Chairman and CEO, Comcast Corp. Held job since: Chairman, 2004; CEO, 2002 Sources of power: An unassuming media executive in an industry filled with CEOs willing to pitch, promote and propagandize, Roberts presides over one of the largest distributorships of video in the nation, as well as the NBCUniversal entertainment empire. He has quietly worked to keep the company current by investing in sports rights as well as overseas assets like Sky. Roberts must now steer the company around new hurdles, including cord cutting and the rise of streaming video. Because nothing stays the same in pay TV for long. With the planned Versant Media spinoff expected to be completed early next year, Comcast will soon part with the basic cable networks that were so central to its purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric back in 2011. Title: Chairman and CEO, Universal Music Group Held job since: 2010 Sources of power: Grainge joined Universal in 1986 at leader of its Polydor publishing division and rose through the ranks during periods of galvanizing change in the industry, assuming the helm in 2010 just as streaming was beginning to take hold. In the years since he has presided over UMG’s expansion into the world’s largest music company — with artists ranging from the Beatles and Taylor Swift to the Weeknd and “KPop Demon Hunters” — its public listing in 2021, the expansion of its publishing and merchandise divisions, and the rise and plateau of streaming growth. Most recently, UMG has taken a leadership position in steering the industry through the challenges of AI (striking deals with and/or lawsuits against major AI companies — or both, as with Suno) and its next areas of growth, including initiatives to increasingly monetize “superfans.” There are certainly challenges: UMG’s $775 million acquisition of the artist-services company Downtown is under fierce scrutiny from the EU, and it was actually sued for defamation by Drake, one of its biggest artists, in bizarre collateral damage from that artist’s feud with fellow UMG artist Kendrick Lamar. But in the third quarter of 2025, Universal held nearly 36% U.S. market share — and that was before the release of Taylor Swift’s “Life of a Showgirl,” which sold a record-breaking 2.7 million copies on its first day. Title: CEO, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: David Zaslav has been on a hire-wire act of debt, restructuring and outrunning the marketplace to prove the merger thesis that brought WarnerMedia and Discovery together in April 2022. But time ran out. David Ellison’s aggressive overtures forced his hand to initiate a sale process for all or part of the Warner Bros. Discovery (depending on who’s buying). For the foreseeable future, Zaslav still holds the keys in Burbank and Hudson Yards – and he’s demonstrating that in rebuffing Paramount’s offers more than half a dozen times in favor of Netflix’s $83 billion offer. Leading WBD for the past three years has been Zaslav’s highest profile job in Hollywood – and he’s become a lightning rod in the creative community at a time of disruption. Zaslav got his start in the go-go early days of cable in the 1980s with a long tenure at NBC where he helped launch CNBC and MSNBC. He gained prominence as a CEO – and for his huge paychecks — after he took the reins of Discovery Communications in late 2006. Title: Senior VP of Services, Apple Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: Cue is the ultimate Apple insider. He has long steered its expansion on the software and services side of the ledger for the company that has transformed the world with its hardware. He also clearly has the trust of CEO Tim Cook to set the agenda for Apple in Hollywood. Cue has embraced a build-not-buy strategy as Apple has revved up the Apple TV content business with big-budget series, sports rights, documentaries and children’s programs. The success of Apple’s first mega-budget film production, “F1: The Movie,” reflected well on Cue’s steady-hand stewardship. And his ambition was on display when he told Variety during a cover story interview that he really wanted “F1” to reach moviegoers in a profound way. “I hope that when most people go see the movie, they walk out wanting to be a race car driver,” he told Variety in April 2025. Title: Chief Content Officer, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Nearly three years into her gig as chief content officer at Netflix and with almost a decade at the streamer under her belt, Bajaria oversees some of the biggest and boldest TV shows of our time, including “Stranger Things,” “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” “Bridgerton,” “Heeramandi” and “Lupin,” and Oscar-winning films like “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio.” And her power in Hollywood is poised to get even bigger if Netflix succeeds in taking over Warner Bros. Discovery. For now, Bajaria’s focus is on continuing to grow Netflix’s local-programming offerings throughout the globe and pushing the streamer further into live events and sports. Before joining Netflix, Bela was president of Universal Television. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Bergman is the well-respected leader in charge of the Mouse House’s film studios, which feed into both theatrical and streaming pipelines. He’s managing not just release windows and production budgets, but also egos. On his watch, Disney has produced several billion-dollar-plus hits, including “Inside Out 2,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Moana 2” and the live-action “Lilo & Stitch,” with “Zootopia 2” on track to be another big winner. A nearly three-decade company veteran, he became chairman of Walt Disney Studios in 2021. He was elevated to his current role in 2023, in which capacity he has shared oversight (alongside Dana Walden) of Disney’s direct-to-consumer, technology and ad sales groups, as well as international content and operations. Title: Head of Amazon MGM Studios and Amazon Prime Video Held job since: 2020 Sources of power: Mike Hopkins shepherded some big changes at Amazon’s on-screen entertainment division this year with the exits of both Jennifer Salke and Vernon Sanders from the studio business, and the entrance of longtime Netflix TV exec Peter Friedlander. Building on his background in distribution and sales from his time as CEO at Hulu and president of Fox networks, Hopkins continues to push Amazon into TV ad sales through its Amazon Ads infrastructure to growing success. Under Hopkins, Prime Video currently offers more than 100 add-on subscription options in the U.S., including Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max, Paramount+, Sony’s Crunchyroll and Amazon-owned MGM+. Amazon’s reach has made the channels offering a big driver of subscription for these media partners. Title: President and CEO, Live Nation Held job since: 2005 Sources of power: A master of vertical integration, Rapino has kept Live Nation and Ticketmaster to one record-breaking year after another even as the post-pandemic boom in concertgoing has leveled off. So far in 2025, Live Nation is on pace to have its biggest year yet, with overall revenue for the first nine months hitting $18.89 billion, up eight percent compared to last year’s $17.5 billion. Much of the company’s growth can be attributed to the demand for live entertainment in international markets, where fan count is projected to surpass the United States for the first time. Chalk that up to major tours that saw artists like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé traipsing the globe, yet it’s also the company’s ongoing ventures into management, venue ownership and other related areas of the business. Title: Chairman and CEO, HBO and Max Content Held job since: August 2020 Sources of power: Casey Bloys likes awards, and for good reason: HBO/HBO Max gets a lot of them. In 2025, the combined outlets landed 30 Emmys — tying Netflix for the most — thanks to the strength of series like “The Pitt” (outstanding drama series), “The Penguin,” “Hacks,” “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and more. His current roster also includes smashes like “House of the Dragon,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us” and “Euphoria” — which recently gave him four current original series with cross-platform audiences averaging more than 15 million viewers per episode – a first for the pay cabler. Other titles that have driven the TV conversation under his watch have included “Succession,” “Barry,” “The Rehearsal,” the “True Detective” franchise, “And Just Like That” and “Peacemaker”; and earlier, “Veep,” “Girls,” “Silicon Valley,” “Watchmen,” “Westworld,” “Big Little Lies” and “Chernobyl.” Bloys first took over HBO series, late night and specials as president in February 2016; he joined the network in 2004 as director of development at HBO Independent Productions. Title: Chairman, FX Networks Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: An astute observer of the TV landscape and respected creative leader, Landgraf has made boundary-pushing television a hallmark of FX ever since he joined in 2004. Under Landgraf, FX has produced solid ratings and acclaim with bold (some might say risky) bets such as “Shōgun” — winner of 18 Emmy awards, a one-year record for a single series — as well as series like “The Bear,” “Fargo,” “Alien: Earth,” long-running fan-favorite “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and Ryan Murphy’s “American Horror Story” franchise. After Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Landgraf aligned with the Mouse House’s streaming strategy to make Hulu the primary streaming outlet for FX, which has let him continue to take big swings on standout content. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Peters may not have the name recognition of his co-CEO partner Ted Sarandos, but the duo are on equal footing in running the streaming giant. Peters, who joined Netflix in 2008, was previously chief product officer and spent several years as general manager of Netflix Japan. While Sarandos handles the content side, Peters focuses on technology, product development, pricing and partnerships. His purview also includes the still-nascent games initiative and the growing ad-supported business. Peters knows the Netflix culture inside and out, and he’s credited with building the company’s talent organization and recently overseeing a revision to its famed “Culture Memo.” Peters will be an integral part of any integration of Warner Bros. and HBO into Netflix, should the acquisition agreement come to pass. Title: President, Marvel Studios; Chief Creative Officer, Marvel Held job since: 2010 / 2019 Sources of power: After a stretch of ho-hum box office performers in recent years, Marvel Studios aims to reclaim its status as the premiere superhero studio in 2026 with “Avengers: Doomsday.” The blockbuster-to-be features the return of “Endgame” directors Anthony and Joe Russo, the revival of Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, and recasting Robert Downey Jr. as the villainous Doctor Doom, plus finally introducing the X-Men into the MCU. In a rare interview with reporters over the summer, Feige declared that well-documented problems Marvel’s been facing stem from an overabundance of supply, not a sudden drop in demand. As such, Marvel’s output for 2026 will be drastically decreased, with just three movies launching in theaters: “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” the studio’s co-production with Sony Pictures; a special re-release of “Avengers: Endgame” and “Doomsday.” Title: President and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ravi Ahuja was one half of the most orderly transition atop a Hollywood studio in recent memory. He took the CEO reins from Tony Vinciquerra last January, but the plan was set in motion when Ahuja was recruited to Sony to head TV operations, after a he had a brief run as president of business operations and chief financial officer of Walt Disney Television. Ahuja’s first big test at Sony was steering the “Jeopardy” host transition, which took two tries to get right, but America’s favorite quiz show endured. Now he’s got a long runway to lead the studio into its second century (Columbia Pictures marked its centennial in 2024) and its endowed with a library of more than 3,500 films and more than 35,000 episodes in an IP-hungry marketplace. Title: President, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: • He’s the key operating executive overseeing the newly merged Paramount Skydance.• He’s a media veteran after climbing the ranks at NBCUniversal, Comcast and Fox. Shell has rebounded at the enlarged Paramount Skydance after exiting NBCUniversal in 2023 after admitting to having had an inappropriate relationship with an NBCUniversal employee. He’s now back in new role as David Ellison’s right-hand man given his depth of experience. At Paramount Skydance, he’s overseeing day-to-day operations, a task that has included a wave of mass layoffs conducted three months after the Paramount Global takeover closed. Shell isn’t just trying to slash costs: He and Ellison envision a new path forward for Paramount’s TV business, hoping to reinvent brands like CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central for a streaming-centric world, while pumping more content into Paramount+. If his boss is successful in landing Warner Bros. Discovery, Shell will have an even bigger collection of media businesses under his oversight. Title: Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corp., Chairman of News Corp. Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Under Murdoch’s aegis, Fox Corp. proven surprisingly robust and resilient. After the company sold off much of its studio and cable assets to Disney in 2019, conventional wisdom held that Fox would be a small but feisty element in the media ecosystem, but the company’s focus on news, sports and other types of must-watch-as-it-happens content has boosted viewership and revenue. There are challenges ahead, especially as the NFL moves closer to renegotiating its current media contracts, but Fox has thrived by taking measured steps into streaming and bigger steps to lock in live viewership. Title: President and CEO, Sony Group Corporation Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Hiroki Totoki took over as Sony’s CEO in April 2025 as the company’s center of gravity shifted decisively toward entertainment. In the run-up to the transition, he was closely involved in steering Sony’s entertainment businesses toward greater IP coordination across Pictures, Music and PlayStation, reinforcing a strategy built on franchises that can move across formats and markets. That approach aligns with Sony’s long-standing focus on Kando — emotional impact delivered at scale — and has shown up in properties ranging from anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer” to cross-media adaptations like “The Last of Us.” Totoki also took direct oversight of Sony Interactive Entertainment during a leadership transition, underlining his role as the executive trusted with execution when the stakes are high. As CEO, he now controls a company where games, music, film and anime drive strategy — alongside the hardware that carries them. Title: Co-Chair and CEO, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca proved naysayers wrong this year after a rough 2024 and early 2025. They turned things around the old-fashioned way – by banking on bold directors and new ideas during a time where reboots and sequels have reigned supreme. Movies of all shapes and sizes, from Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” Zach Cregger’s “Weapons” and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” scored with audiences. It’s an ethos that De Luca has embraced throughout his career, which took off when he was named production chief at New Line Cinema at the age of 27. He championed films such as “Seven,” “Boogie Nights,” “Friday” and helped to launch the careers of David Fincher and Anderson. The pair headed MGM prior to its sale to Amazon, which was around the time that Warner Bros. was in the market for new film leadership. Abdy and De Luca got to work quickly and took big swings while brokering deals with directors and stars like Ryan Coogler, Emerald Fennell, Zach Cregger and Tom Cruise. The 2025 slate backs up the pair’s promise to use WB’s considerable resources to make the studio an attractive place to work for “filmmakers with singular visions,” as they wrote in a memo to staff in October after renewing their contracts. Title: Chairman and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Rothman is the definition of a certain kind of hard-driving studio executive of yore but this year he proved he can innovate with original concepts and service big IP at the same time. He bet on Keke Palmer, SZA and Issa Rae with the commercial and critical hit “One of Them Days,” relaunched Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later” franchise with a sequel to follow immediately in ’26 and captured the zeitgeist with “KPop Demon Hunters” (though that film released via Sony’s pay-one partner Netflix). As always with Rothman, the man guaranteed to deliver an expletive-laden sound bite at CinemaCon, it’s about next year’s slate. 2026 will bring “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” and the innovative four-part biopic release “The Beatles” from filmmaker Sam Mendes. Title: Chairman, Netflix Film Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: After building a reputation on spinning popular film franchises out of existing IP (“The Lego Movie” franchise, Stephen King’s “It” and “Sherlock Holmes”), in 2024, film producer Dan Lin pivoted from film producer to studio head by taking on the top film job at Netflix. Just two years prior, Lin had been in negotiations to become head of DC Studios but decided to stick to his own shingle, Rideback, but the Netflix offer proved to be the right kind of challenge. Since joining the streamer, Lin has enforced a strategy of making one major tentpole film each quarter — upcoming offerings include “The Rip,” from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; “Apex” with Charlize Theron; and “Here Comes the Flood,” with Denzel Washingont, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Robert Pattionson. Among Lin’s biggest wins so far was overseeing the final cut of “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” which has become Netflix’s biggest film ever and greenlighting an ambitious slate of films, including Greta Gerwig’s “Narnia,” which will also play an exclusive engagement at Imax theaters worldwide. Titles: Co-Head, Worldwide Video, Apple Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Erlicht and Van Amburg long ago learned how to expand their effectiveness through an air-tight partnership. They worked together for 15 years as programming executives at Sony Pictures Television and its predecessors before being recruited in 2017 by Apple services boss Eddy Cue to drive the company’s leap into original content production and commissioning what was born in November 2019 as Apple TV+ (in October, they nixed the + sign with a rebrand as Apple TV). The two have built the operation in the fishbowl of being a high-profile startup effort within a corporate giant of immense influence and a $4 trillion market cap. Erlicht and Van Amburg have endured waves of rumored shakeups and scrutiny of their creative strategies. This summer “F1: The Movie” was the kind of popcorn vehicle at the global box office that made the parent company proud. It also dovetailed nicely with Apple TV’s five-year deal unveiled in October that will bring F1 racing rights to its platform in the U.S. starting in 2026. Title: Co-Chair, Paramount Pictures and Chair, Paramount Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Dana Goldberg has a bigger picture to look at these days now that her longtime home Skydance is also home to all of Paramount’s IP. Partnered with Josh Greenstein on the film front and flying solo at the top of TV, Goldberg is plotting out long-term strategy for both divisions under David Ellison’s new regime. As of this year, Goldberg now oversees production, marketing, distribution and strategic planning, and has added Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Films and Paramount Television Studios to her purview. Goldberg joined Skydance in 2010 as president of production and helped found Skydance Television in 2013. Most recently, Goldberg was chief creative officer of Skydance overseeing several entries in the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise, as well as hit series like “Reacher” and “Jack Ryan.” Before joining Skydance, Goldberg was head of production at Village Roadshow Pictures. Title: Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chair of Platforms, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: This year, Josh Greenstein left Sony Pictures after a decade to head up the film division at the newly merged Skydance-Paramount alongside Dana Goldberg, and advise on Paramount’s new cross-platform strategy across film and TV. For the previous 10 years, Greenstein was at the top of Sony’s Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films, AFFIRM Films, and Sony Pictures Animation, overseeing films including the “Spider-Man” and “Spiderverse” franchises, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “James Bond” and Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” During Greenstein’s tenure, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time, earning $1.91 billion worldwide at the box office and “Into the Spider-Verse” won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Prior to joining Sony, he was head of marketing at Paramount Pictures, overseeing franchises including “Transformers,” “Star Trek,” “Jackass” and “Scary Movie.” Title: Co-chairman and CEO, DC Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: James Gunn and Peter Safran, the new guardians of DC Studios, were hired to create a cohesive, long-term strategy for the Warner Bros.-owned comic book empire. Gunn, the operation’s creative mind, took those efforts into his own hands with last summer’s hit “Superman,” which had epic responsibility of relaunching DC Universe. (The studio’s last iteration of superhero movies imploded with the unfortunate losing-streak of “The Flash,” “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “Blue Beetle.”) Gunn will return to the director’s chair for what he describes as the “next installment in the Super-Family,” but he’s passed off the reins for “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” two spinoffs set in 2026 that’ll be a bigger test of DC’s popularity. Both focus on comic book characters that don’t enjoy the benefit of being household names. Safran, a business-minded executive and a former talent manager with Brillstein-Grey, has proven a flair for knowing the projects that’ll speak to audiences. He’s a lead producer on the “Conjuring” universe, which is the highest-grossing horror franchise with more than $2 billion across nine films. Title: CEO, Lionsgate Held job since: 2000 Sources of power: Lionsgate was a much smaller operation when Feltheimer took over the the turn of the 2000s after nine years at Sony’s Columbia TriStar TV Group. The Canadian-born studio emerged as a global contender on Feltheimer’s watch with hits such as the “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games” film series. The studio rode the pre-Peak TV wave of scripted expansion with such distinctive hits as “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and more recently “Ghosts,” “Yellowjackets” and “The Studio.” But like every other studio, Lionsgate’s traditional profit engines are under new pressures that will challenge the leadership of a long-serving CEO. Title: CEO, Sony Music Entertainment/Chairman, Sony Music Group Held job since: 2017/2019 Sources of power: Stringer has spent his tenure at Sony Music building out the various arms of the operation, from buying indie companies AWAL and Orchard to acquiring catalogs from Queen and Pink Floyd, for a reported $1.27 billion and $400 million, respectively. This year, Sony Music Entertainment saw significant boosts across the board as records including Tyler, the Creator’s “Don’t Tap the Glass” and Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR Más FOToS” became global hits, boosting total profit from recorded music and publishing to $2.89 billion in Q3 — up 13.3 percent year over year. Over the first three quarters of 2025, SME earned a 26.65 percent market share, per Billboard — ahead of Warner Music Group and indies, and only second to Universal Music Group. And in an industry where AI has become a hotbed for controversy, Stringer has helped broker a landmark deal with Spotify to develop AI tools intended to aid artists. Title: Chairman, Television Studios, NBC Entertainment and Peacock Scripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Pearlena Igbokwe has arguably one of the most compelling stories of any TV executive out there: Having emigrated from Nigeria at age 6, Igbokwe was raised on some the greatest U.S. shows of the 1970s and 1980s. That inspired her to pursue a job in TV, which led her to early positions at NBC and HBO, before starting a 20-year tenure at Showtime, where she developed “Dexter,” “Nurse Jackie” and “Masters of Sex,” among other shows. In 2012, she returned to NBC, and quickly saw her star rise as she worked in drama on series such as “The Blacklist” and “This Is Us.” Moving to Universal TV as president, she expanded the Dick Wolf empire (which now includes the “Law & Order,” “Chicago” and “FBI” franchises) and built a thriving business as a supplier to outlets like Netflix and HBO. Taking over Universal Studio Group in 2020, Igbokwe now oversees teams that handle staples like NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “America’s Got Talent” as well as HBO Max’s “Hacks,” Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside” and all those Wolf shows. And the talent in her company’s purview include Mike Schur, Tina Fey, Jordan Peele, Darren Star, Nahnatchka Khan, Seth MacFarlane, Julie Plec, Amy Poehler, Lorne Michaels and others. Title: Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and US Networks Held job since: 2021 / 2025 Sources of power: Channing Dungey has made history several times in her career, including as the first Black executive to lead a major broadcast network, and the first woman and first Black executive to run Warner Bros. TV Group. Her oversight include Warner Bros. TV, Warner Bros. Unscripted TV (including Warner Horizon, Shed Media and Telepictures) and animated producers Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. On her watch, Warner Bros. TV Group has enjoyed a string of recent successes in network, cable, streaming and syndication including “The Pitt,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Ted Lasso,” “The Bachelor” franchise, “The Penguin,” “Shrinking,” “The Voice,” “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage,” “Running Point,” “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” “You” and more. Before Warner Bros. and Discovery plan their split — which would move the U.S. networks to a separate company — Dungey has also spent part of the past year evolving the conglom’s linear TV business with channels like Discovery, HGTV, Food, Cartoon Network, TLC, Adult Swim, TBS, TNT, TCM and others. Dungey is a well-liked, celebrated exec who at ABC Entertainment built hits like “The Good Doctor” and the return of “American Idol,” and also made a swift change to “Roseanne” when its star made offensive remarks on social media. She also developed signature shows like “Scandal” and “Once Upon a Time” and helped keep long-running series like “Grey’s Anatomy” as juggernauts. She was also named one of Variety’s Power of Women honorees in 2021. Title: President of Direct-to-Consumer, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Joe Earley has the marketing sensibilities required to oversee the operations and growth strategies for two of the most important assets of the future for Disney – streamers Disney+ and Hulu. His experience as a producer with Gail Berman at Jackal Group after he left Fox will also serve him well in a job that requires juggling a broad portfolio – from Hulu’s edgy limited series to Disney-branded shows for Disney+. Title: Chair of Direct to Consumer, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: While now a key member of David Ellison’s leadership team at the Skydance-owned Paramount, Cindy Holland is still best known for setting Netflix up to be the powerhouse TV industry player it is today. Holland spent a total of 18 years with the streamer, nine of which she served as head of original content, where she established the programming strategy with early streaming hits including “House of Cards,” “Orange is the New Black” and “Stranger Things.” Earlier this year, Holland stepped away from her role as CEO at indie studio Sister to join Ellison’s exec ranks as the lieutenant in charge of revamping Paramount’s streaming offering as the company enters its new era. Title: CEO, Illumination Entertainment Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Chris Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007 after a stint running animation at Fox. He quickly established the company, which was backed by Universal, as one of the most successful producers of family fare in Hollywood. It all kicked off with 2010’s “Despicable Me,” the story of a reformed supervillain named Gru that has spawned four films and three spinoffs featuring the Minions. But Illumination didn’t stop there, producing hits such as “The Grinch,” “Sing” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” What makes the company’s output particularly appealing is that its movies cost between $70 million to $100 million to produce, far less than the $200 million that Disney typically spends. Next up, Illumination will release “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” and “Minions 3,” both of which are expected to be among 2026’s biggest box office players. Title: President, Disney Television Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Erwich oversees a broad menu of programs and brands in his role leading ABC Entertainment, Hulu Originals, Freeform, Disney Channel and other kidvid platforms. He’s worked as a program buyer and seller, giving him the perspective and connections to juggle a high volume of development and production. Erwich has been key to Disney’s strategy of windowing “Only Murders in the Building,” “Paradise” and other Hulu originals on ABC. “There’s the broadcast experience and the kind of shows that thrive there, but now there’s another window — and a very important and vibrant one for those shows — on Hulu,” Erwich told Variety in April. Title: Chair of TV Media, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: George Cheeks is one of the few Paramount Global senior employees who came out of the Skydance acquisition with a prime spot at the top under David Ellison. Following a brief tenure as co-CEO of Paramount Global upon the exit of Bob Bakish, while also still acting as president and CEO of CBS. Now, Cheeks’ brands include CBS Television Network, CBS News and Stations, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, BET Studios, Nickelodeon TV Studios, See It Now Studios, MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET. Since Cheeks took over at CBS, the network, has launched hits including “Tracker,” “Fire Country,” “Ghosts” and “Matlock.” Cheeks came over to CBS in 2020 after a stint as co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. Title: Head of Theatrical and Streaming Films, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: The longtime Warner Bros. Pictures executive came to Amazon MGM following the ecommerce giant’s purchase of the studio that Variety famously dubbed “the Lion.” Valenti’s arrival was seen as sign that the enlarged studio operation was getting serious about revving up a slate of commercial theatrical films. Valenti’s experience ranges from Harry Potter franchise films to Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” to LEGO movies that helped revive Warner Bros.’ feature animation activity. Now she’s been entrusted with one of filmdom’s crown jewels, James Bond. Valenti’s first move was to turn to seasoned franchise film pros, Amy Pascal and David Heyman, to shepherd Agent 007 into a new chapter with a new star. Amazon MGM also has a big swing coming in June with Mattel’s followup to “Barbie,” the live-action “Masters of the Universe.” Title: CEO, Warner Music Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Kyncl has played captain at Warner Music Group as it’s undergone major restructuring, including last year’s elevation of Elliot Grainge to CEO of subsidiary Atlantic Music Group and waves of company-wide layoffs. And while full-year annual profit for 2025 declined 23%, largely due to the termination of WMG’s distribution deal with BMG, publishing and recorded music revenue thrived, surging 14.6 percent to $1.87 billion. Much of that can be credited to the success of various WMG artists — Rosé, Alex Warren and Sombr, to name a few. Under Kyncl’s leadership in 2025, WMG struck major licensing deals with AI startups Klay and Udio, the latter of which it had previously sued for copyright infringement. He has an ambitious blueprint to lead the company into the future — he even wrote a “10 year plan” for the company — but its execution will be a challenge. Title: Chairman, Sony Pictures Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Le Goy is a longtime Sony Pictures Entertainment insider who is well positioned to help drive the parent company’s efforts to find connections among the company’s autonomous entertainment-focused units: Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music and Sony PlayStation. He previously headed worldwide distribution and networks, which gives him a strong sense of the company’s range of production and channel assets in the U.S. and abroad. Before Sony, Le Goy oversaw European distribution for Disney TV. Title: Head of Global TV, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: After a long run at Netflix, Peter Friedlander in October moved across town to lead global TV for Amazon MGM Studios. His front-row seat to the Netflix revolution will serve him well as Amazon MGM calibrates its TV strategy for Prime Video and elsewhere. Friedlander is extremely well connected in the creative community after years at Netflix and at Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman’s Playtone banner before that. All of those contacts and a big hunk of the goodwill he has in the bank will come in handy as the studio looks for growth. Title: CEO, Microsoft Gaming Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Beginning with an internship in 1988, Phil Spencer has been a Microsoft employee for longer than many of his biggest fans have been alive. Now head of Microsoft Gaming, Spencer oversees brands including Xbox, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Throughout many years at the company, Spencer has launched several consoles, including the current generation Xbox Series X and S and this year’s debut of the ROG Ally handheld collection, and overseen video game franchises including “Call of Duty,” “Minecraft,” “Halo,” “Gears of War,” “Starfield,” “Doom” and “Forza.” While navigating industry criticism and fan backlash this year amid workforce reductions and price increases, Spencer has also drawn praise for his commitment to backing Xbox’s subscription Game Pass service and licensing out Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, making those the new priority drivers of growth as console sales dwindle. The successful adaptation of the “Fallout” gaming franchise into an Amazon Prime Video drama series was another feather in Spencer’s cap. Title: Chairman and CEO, Take-Two Interactive Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Strauss Zelnick began his career in Hollywood at Columbia Pictures, home video distributor Vestron and Twentieth Century Fox. But he segued into big-league investing and video games nearly 20 years ago through his ZMC investment vehicle. Take-Two is home to one of gaming’s most valuable franchises, “Grand Theft Auto.” The company will be under renewed scrutiny in 2026 after multiple delays in the release of the long-waited “Grand Theft Auto VI.” The most recent was the news from November 2025 that the title would be pushed by six months from May to November 2026. By that time it will have been 13 year since the debut of “GTA 5.” Outside of Take-Two, Zelnick may well wind up with a bigger footprint in entertainment if ZMC finds opportunities in the M&A wave that is gripping traditional media and entertainment. Title: Founder, chairman and CEO, Roku Held job since: 2002 Sources of power: Wood has generally kept a low profile in Hollywood since his entrepreneurial drive lead him into media in the late 1990s. He represents the “Halt and Catch Fire” era of cutting-edge digital products and savvy business leaders that emerged from the tech boom in Texas in the 1980s and ‘90s. Wood was early to see the opportunity for more consumer-friendly on-demand platforms, and that positions Roku well for the future as streaming becomes the dominant TV and home entertainment delivery system. Title: Founder and CEO, Spotify Held job since: 2006 Sources of power: After more than two decades in his role at Spotify, Ek is poised to step down from CEO at the streaming company at the end of 2025 while remaining executive chairman. His making the change — to the degree he actually steps back — on a high note: Throughout his tenure, he made Spotify the premium destination for streaming and saved an industry that was collapsing under the weight of illegal downloading. He ushered Spotify to its current market cap of $118 billion and grew its audience to 713 million active users and 281 million subscribers, up more than 10% from 2024. Ek spent the year diversifying Spotify’s outside investments, inking a deal with Netflix to stream a collection of original podcasts and another with Amazon to give advertisers using Amazon DSP programmatic access to Spotify’s streaming audio and video inventory. Title: Co-CEO, Comcast Held job since: 2025 (announced to take effect in January) Sources of power: Will have significant say over company’s future direction as Roberts cedes some of his CEO duties.Cavanagh is taking more of the reins at Comcast as Brian Roberts looks to do more with exploring technology. He brings to Comcast an outlook forged in part by time on Wall Street. He was He was the co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s Corporate & Investment Bank from 2012 to 2014, and served as JPMorgan Chase’s CFO for six years. Look for Cavanagh to have a big say over Comcast’s policies governing potential mergers-and-acquisitions; investment in sports rights; and balancing the need to grow its streaming assets while keeping interest in its still-sizable linear TV footprint. Title: Chief Creative Officer, Pixar Animation Studios Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Pixar’s has had its highs and lows at the box office in recent years but the animation studio’s brand nonetheless remains a magnet for kid and family audiences. Docter stepped up to the top creative job in 2018 when the company faced a moment of sudden transition after the exit of longtime creative leader John Lasseter. Docter was one of Pixar’s first employees long before the pioneering CG animation shop was part of Disney. He is respected for maintaining Pixar’s culture of creativity even as it has stepped up its production slate. Title: VP of Film, Netflix Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Longtime Sony executive Belgrad has spent his career making theatrical movies across a spectrum of budgets, making him an ideal partner for Dan Lin at the Netflix film vertical. Belgrad, for starters, manages the streamer’s important relationship with pay-one partner Sony Pictures (the union that gave us the “KPop Demon Hunters” juggernaut). Belgrad has been vital to get live-action features for Netflix out of that deal, including the upcoming “People We Meet On Vacation” and Kevin Hart’s “72 Hours.” He’s also brought key new filmmakers into the fold — like Clint Bentley, Lena Dunham and James Mangold — and scored big auction packages including the “Eloise” movie with Amy Sherman-Palladino and producer Ryan Reynolds; as well as “Unabom” with Russell Crowe and Shailene Woodley. Title: President, Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The exceedingly likable Greenbaum took a giant leap up from his longtime post at Searchlight Pictures to replace Sean Bailey at Disney’s mothership this year. He now oversees all live action filmmaking for the Walt Disney label and acts as steward for 20th Century Studios. Across both, he shepherds key filmmakers and – as the town has taken note – is actively courting original IP to serve younger audiences (particularly boys). Over his first few months, Greenbaum landed an action-drama package about the Hawaii mafia with Martin Scorsese and Dwayne Johnson, a hot time travel thriller from Edward Berger and Austin Butler, and the rights to Katherine Rundell’s fantasy series “Impossible Creatures.” Title: CEO, Neon Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Tom Quinn launched Neon in 2017 and quickly established it as one of the hottest brands in the indie film world. Under his leadership, Neon has become a major awards season player. It captured Best Picture for 2019’s “Parasite,” which made history as the first foreign film to win the top prize. Then pulled off the feat a second time with 2024’s “Anora,” a $6 million dark comedy that ranks as one of the lowest budgetted Best Picture victors ever. He’s also released such Oscar-nominated films as “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Triangle of Sadness,” and “I, Tonya.” Beyond arthouse fare, Neon scored at the box office with a series of twisty horror flicks, “The Monkey” and “Longlegs,” from Osgood Perkins, with whom the company has a first-look deal. However, Perkins’ latest film, “Keeper,” was a rare miss. In 2025, Neon released one of its most critically acclaimed slates, distributing Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just An Accident” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” both of which are expected to factor heavily into the Oscar race. Title: Chairman, Focus Features Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Peter Kujawski is a well-liked figure in the film community for his enthusiasm for movies and moviegoing, and for his taste in filmmakers and projects. He’s been a steady hand at Focus Features since 2016, but and he had an earlier run at the unit’s outset in 2002, where he played a big part in the releases of such notable pics as Michel Gondry’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Sofia Coppola’s Lost In Translation” and Gus Van Sant’s “Milk.” His 2025 fall and winter slate was as an ambitious as any distributor that tackled adult dramas: “Bugonia,” “Hamnet” and “Song Sung Blue.” Title: CEO and Founder, Blumhouse Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Blum has made his mark in Hollywood with his distinctive approach to horror films and his financial prowess. In short, he figured out to do micro-budget production at scale. And even in a year when the much-anticipated sequel “MEGAN 2.0” fell flat, the company’s eight theatrical film releases in 2025 still passed the $1 billion mark at the box office. Blumhouse has also expanded significantly since the current iteration of the company was formed in 2015. This year, Blumhouse bolstered its core business by completing its merger with James Wan’s Atomic Monster. Title: Co-Founder, A24 Held job since: 2012 Sources of power: The eternally mysterious Fenkel and Katz, who won’t even agree to be photographed on the annual Oscars red carpet, continued their streak as one of the most enviable labels in indie film while quietly growing their company from within. A24 saw the most profitable run of its existence this year, largely thanks to the overperformance of Celine Song’s “Materialists” (over $100 million at the global box office on a $20 million budget). Strong singles and doubles came with Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby,” “Friendship” and “Bring Her Back,” and “Mary Supreme” is set to light up the specialty box office at Christmas. At the top of this year, Thrive Capital closed an investment round that sources say brings A24’s valuation to roughly $3.5 billion. Title: VP of Original Series, Netflix Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Howe got the nod to run original scripted series for the U.S. and Canada at Netflix after her longtime boss, Peter Friedlander, departed for a new gig as head of global series for Amazon MGM. Howe has been a key player for years in Netflix’s original content strategy, playing an instrumental role in such series as “Bridgerton,” the Emmy-winning “Beef” and “The Diplomat.” Now she’s heading up the biggest sandbox in series development. Title: Chairman, Bravo and Peacock Unscripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Berwick has seen her job description and title at NBCUniversal change numerous times over the past decade, but her focus rarely wavered. She has been the driving executive force behind Bravo even before NBC bought the cable channel in 2002. With NBCUniversal slimming down through the spinoff of USA Network, Syfy, Oxygen, E!, Berwick’s new role in the restructuring unveiled in January 2025 is tailored to her strengths. That’s demonstrated by Peacock’s success with unscripted shows including “The Traitors’ and “Love Island USA” and the fans flocking to BravoCon events in recent years. Title: President, CBS Studios Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: David Stapf is among the elite list of top Hollywood executives who began their career in publicity and communications before transitioning into senior management. After helping launch iconic series like “Friends” and “ER” at Warner Bros. TV, he moved to a current programming job at CBS in 1999, stewarding series like “Everybody Loves Raymond.” In 2004 he moved over to CBS’ in-house studio, where he was key to the launch and growth of “NCIS” and its spinoffs. He also developed “The Good Wife” and its spinoffs with Robert and Michelle King, and is guiding Kathy Bates’ successful “Matlock” series. Stapf brought the “Star Trek” world back to life on TV with “Star Trek: Discovery,” “Picard,” “Lower Decks,” “Strange New Worlds” and “Starfleet Academy.” In late night, he oversaw the launches of Stephen Colbert’s and James Corden’s talkers — and their wind downs (including Colbert’s exit this coming May). And he launched the first new daytime soap in years, CBS’ “Beyond the Gates.” Stapf even expanded his domain as a supplier for streamers like Netflix, and as an international producer on shows including “Colin From Accounts” and “King & Conqueror.” Title: Chairman of Business Affairs and Operations, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Jimmy Horowitz is widely respected as an honest broker and a shrewd dealmaker. He’s been a major player in driving business and monetization across the film studio for decades; more recently his purview has expanded to include television. He’s connections and his experience will no doubt come into play as NBCUniversal completes the Versant spinoff and reinvents itself once again around NBC, Universal film and TV production, Bravo and Peacock and theme parks. Title: President, Disney Television Studios and Global Original Television Strategy, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Schrier came up the ranks under John Langraf at FX, which gives him a level of respect and connections in the creative community that he will need to help reinvent Disney’s TV production operations. He was hand-picked by Dana Walden to steer the TV studios’ business operations. In recent years, Schrier has invested in time and resources into growing Disney’s local-language activity for Disney+ and other production activity outside the U.S. Title: President, Warner Bros. Television Group Held job since: 2024 Source of power: The future of Warner Bros. Television Group may be uncertain as Netflix and Paramount Skydance battle it out for the studio. But there’s no doubt that Paul has played an enormous role in the company’s success over the past 30 years. He’s a well regarded dealmaker who has always nurtured strong relationships with WB’s top talent. Title: President, ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: OConnell has the hard task of managing the operations of ABC News and leading business operations for Disney’s linear networks, including ABC, FX Networks, Freeform and National Geographic. She’s managing businesses that are inevitably in decline while Disney’s streaming platforms gain steam. But Disney is also working across the company to leverage the reach and deep footprint (for now) of ABC, FX and the larger cablers to help bolster Disney+ and Hulu and to squeeze more value out of high-priced premium shows. OConnell earned the esteem of her colleagues by handling the tricky transition of leadership at ABC News just a few months after her role was expanded to encompass the division. Title: CEO, AMC Networks Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Dolan has been slowly shifting the centers of gravity that the company she took over in February 2023. AMC Networks is home to AMC, SundanceTV, IFC, WeTV and BBC America, as well as streamers Shudder, Acorn TV and ALLBLK. Dolan worked with Netflix and HBO Max to find bigger showcases for AMC-branded shows. She also has pull as a member of the family that controls the closely held company. Title: CEO, AMC Theatres Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Adam Aron, who became the CEO of AMC Theatres in 2016, has learned to embrace the disruption. Over the past few years, he’s survived a pandemic that devastated his business and withstood rollercoaster share prices amid a box office that has failed to regain its pre-pandemic strength. Rather than relying entirely on the studios that supply the blockbusters, Aron has made several attempts to expand AMC’s business outside of box office, including the viral “Dune” popcorn bucket and other movie-themed merchandise that has contributed tens of millions in annual sales. He also spearheaded the chain’s foray into distribution with 2023’s commercial hit “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film and this year’s “Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl.” And he turned AMC into the de facto choice for movie lovers after hiring Nicole Kidman for the chain’s now-iconic promotional campaign to get people back to the movies. (Patrons even petitioned when AMC attempted to shorten the commercial, in which Kidman famously declares that “somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.”) Now that’s movie magic. Title: CEO, Imax Corp. Held job since: 2009 Sources of power: Blockbuster directors and stars like Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise and Ryan Coogler are known to rhapsodize about the singular experience of watching their films in Imax, a premium film format that has skyrocketed in popularity since COVID. That makes Richard Gelfond, who controls access to the finite number of screens that tend to generate outsized ticket sales, a very popular person when those mega-watt talents have a new movie to unveil. Thanks to Gelfond’s key relationships, Imax has benefited in recent years as audiences opt for premium large formats to distinguish the out-of-the-home moviegoing experience. When Gelfond joined Imax in 1994, the company was best known for supplying science documentaries to theaters inside museums. Over the decades, Gelfond, who became CEO in 2009, has turned the technology brand into a legitimate powerhouse in Hollywood. Title: President, Paramount Television Studios Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Matt Thunell sits atop Paramount Television Studios operations, a unit formed in August, post-merger out of the assets of Skydance Television, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Nickelodeon Live Action and Awesomeness. He’s got an opportunity to rev up a franchise factory for the enlarged studio. Paramount TV Studios is home to the Taylor Sheridan-verse, Paramount+’s “Yellowjackets,” among other shows. Thunell worked on “Stranger Things” at Netflix before he joined Skydance to head the TV unit in 2022. Title: CEO, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Grode may not be as flashy as some chiefs in town, but his stable of intellectual property provides all the shine he needs to keep Legendary at the top of the popcorn conversation. 2025 brought the staggering success of “A Minecraft Movie,” the almost billion-dollar-grosser that Grode’s studio executed with Warner Bros. While Legendary will be moving south of Burbank for a new distribution pact with Paramount, the label will release a third “Dune” film in 2026, as well as more monsters from the Godzilla universe and a hotly anticipated adaptation of beloved arcade game “Street Fighter.” Title: Vice Chair of Worldwide Production, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Parent’s range of experience — from a long run at Universal Pictures to MGM to New Line Cinema early in her career — gives her the perspective and business connections to drive promising film and TV projects for Legendary. Her depth alone makes Legendary an attractive partner for studios looking for reliable popcorn fare. Title: President, Searchlight Pictures Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Greenfield rose up the leadership ladder at Searchlight after working as a film producer and at the Sundance Institute. He’s highly regarded in the industry for his taste and for championing strong filmmakers. He was a key player in helping Searchlight make the transition into Disney after the 21st Century Fox acquisition in 2019. Title: CEO, Fox Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Rob Wade was already a reality TV veteran in the U.K. (“Big Brother,” “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here”) when he crossed the pond in 2005 to work on the first season of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars.” He eventually became the showrunner of “DWTS.” He also headed up U.S. TV at Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment, working on shows like “America’s Got Talent” and “The X Factor.” After a stint as head of entertainment development at BBC Worldwide, Wade joined Fox in 2017 as president of alternative entertainment and specials, overseeing an unscripted slate such as “The Masked Singer,” “Lego Masters” and “Hell’s Kitchen.” He was there when Disney acquired Fox’s studio operations, making the network a stand-alone indie — and giving him and then-CEO Charlie Collier license to be entrepreneurial. When Collier left for Roku in 2022, Wade was tapped by Lachlan Murdoch to continue leading Fox’s evolution in entertainment. Title: President and CEO, Starz Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Starz is settling into its next chapter after completing a long and complicated spinoff process from parent company Lionsgate. Now Hirsch and his team have more control to guide Starz’s transition away from linear cable to subscription streaming. Hirsch’s background in marketing has helped Starz make the most of its most popular franchises such as the “Power” drama series and the “Outlander” fantasy universe. Title: President and Chairman, A+E Global Media Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Buccieri has worked to transform A+E Global Media’s operations since he was promoted to the top job in 2018. He’s made savvy licensing deals that protected the company’s core business but generated cash flow from the FAST channel licensing bonanza of the past few years. Under Buccieri, Lifetime, History and A&E Network have gained respect for investing in a slate of event programs rather than joining the original series arms race. He’s also highly regarded as a manager – skills he will need as parent companies Disney and Hearst quietly shop their long-standing joint venture to prospective buyers. Title: Chair & Chief Creative Officer, Lionsgate Television Group Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: In an industry filled with executive shuffles and organizational changes, Kevin Beggs has been a stalwart at Lionsgate Television Group. He first joined the company when it was a much smaller entity and helped grow it over the years to critical acclaim with signature hits like “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and “Orange Is the New Black.” This year, Lionsgate earned 25 Emmy nominations — including 23 Emmy nods for Apple TV+’s “The Studio,” which went on to win a record-breaking 13 Emmys — the most ever for a comedy in a single season. Overseeing a group that includes Lionsgate TV, Lionsgate Alternative TV, Lionsgate Worldwide TV Distribution, 3 Arts Entertainment and Debmar-Mercury, Beggs boasts current series hits including Season 5 of “Ghosts” (CBS), “The Hunting Wive” (Netflix), Season 3 of “Power Book IV: Force” (Starz), “Spartacus: House of Ashur” (Starz), “The Rainmaker” (USA Network), Season 13 of “My Big Fat Fabulous Life” (TLC) and the syndicated strips “Family Feud” and “Sherri.” In addition, 3 Arts is involved with shows like “Hacks” (HBO Max) and “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix). Title: Global Head of Music, YouTube Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Cohen is coming up on a decade of steering music activity for the streaming behemoth. His deep background in the business have come in handy as YouTube debates issues around AI use in the making of music and videos showcased on the site. More recently he’s waded into a dispute with Variety’s sibling publication Billboard about how YouTube streams are counted in Billboard’s chart rankings of music sales. Title: VP of Audio, Twitch and Games, Amazon Held job since: 2012/2023 Sources of power: A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School, Boom’s remit sprawls across Amazon Music, Audible, Twitch, Amazon Games, and Creator Services, the latter of which is a new program that leads the company’s creator-led podcast studio under the Wondery brand, including Dax Shepard’s Golden Globe-nominated “Armchair Expert,” “Mind the Game” with Lebron James and “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce. Initiatives in the past year include Bad Bunny’s final San Juan residency show, “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más,” which became Amazon Music’s all-time most-watched livestream; working with Bad Bunny to launch STEM education programs, agricultural support, and economic development in Puerto Rico; welcoming media-challenged artists like Justin Bieber and Lizzo to Twitch; and developing Alexa+ into a music-recommendation tool. Title: President, Crunchyroll Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: As anime fandom has grown exponentially, Crunchyroll is well positioned to capture subscribers, audience and street cred with fans. The subscription streaming platform owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment has been a success story for the studio, which has made a point of investing in anime assets. Crunchyroll’s emergence on a larger stage was cemented in September when its feature film “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” lead the U.S. box office for two weekends. Purini has deep credentials with fans thanks to his long run at anime shop Funimation before Sony engineered its merger with Crunchyroll in 2021. Title: Chairman and CEO, AEG Presents Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: In any other universe, the man at the top of a live-entertainment empire that includes Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour, Elton John’s five-year “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” trek, the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history (Zach Bryan at Michigan Stadium: 112,408 fans), the Rolling Stones’ recent tours, Coachella, Stagecoach, Sabrina Carpenter, Morgan Wallen and much more would be the Goliath of his industry. However, AEG Live’s main competition is the mighty Live Nation. But Marciano and his AEG Live team give Rapino & Co. a run for their money every year. Partnerships — with Louis Messina for Swift, with Goldenvoice’s Paul Tollett for Coachella and Stagecoach, with Latin powerhouse CMN Events — are a key strength, and he’s also more than doubled the company’s venue portfolio to over 100 (which include L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena and the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas), and also runs other iconic events like London’s BST Hyde Park, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and many more across the globe. Titles: Co-Founders and Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Classics Held job since: 1992 Sources of power: “Michael and Tom,” as they are unanimously known, are part of the furniture here in Hollywood. They are lifelong devotees of art house titles that, more often than not, find a foothold in the mainstream and keep their parent label Sony Pictures in the awards conversation each year. For 2025, they rolled out Jodie Foster’s psychological murder mystery “A Private Life” and Iraq’s stellar bet for this year’s Oscars in “The President’s Cake.” And they may have a dark horse best actor winner on their hands for Ethan Hawke in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Title: Founder, Chairman and CEO, Allen Media Group Held job since: 1993 Sources of power: Byron Allen has demonstrated that he has tenacity to spare in building the media company that he started with a single syndicated TV show that he hosted. Today, Allen Media Group encompasses more than a dozen TV stations in small- and medium-size markets, the Weather Channel and niche lifestyle and genre channels. He’s been expanding in streaming with the college sports and lifestyle platform HBCUGo platform. He also owns the indie film distribution service Freestyle Digital Media. Title: Chief Brand Officer, Walt Disney Co.; President, Disney Entertainment Marketing Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Asad Ayaz has the single-biggest marketing portfolio of any CMO in entertainment. And because Disney is Disney, he has the extra burden of serving as both promoter and protector of the big-D brand that is synonymous with America, apple pie and Mickey Mouse. Ayaz also has a huge remit in overseeing all ballyhoo activity at the studio’s film and TV production imprints and Disney+. Title: President of Marketing, Direct to Consumer and Disney Entertainment Television Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Ryan oversees a roster of platforms and brands of size and scope that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. With her promotion in August, Ryan added oversight of all Disney’s direct to consumer marketing in addition to Disney’s TV studios and linear channels. The job of bringing viewers to the screen has become more complicated in the subscription streaming age. It falls to Ryan and her teams to help build up Disney’s growth engines of the future. Title: Head of Marketing, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Sue Kroll is skilled at selling movies. The former Warner Bros marketing chief was responsible for major promotional campaigns, including “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings” and Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as awards fare like “Argo” and “The Blind Side.” So when Amazon MGM decided to get into the theatrical business and ramp up its film slate, the studio recruited Kroll – reuniting her with Courtenay Valenti, Amazon MGM’s head of film and Warner Bros. former production chief – to market its movies to the masses. The studio admittedly hasn’t had a ton of theatrical offerings since Amazon MGM committed to the big screen. (Making movies takes time.) So 2026 releases, including the Chris Pratt-led “Mercy,” Ryan Gosling’s space drama “Project Hail Mary” and Colleen Hoover adaptation “Verity,” will be a better showcase of Kroll’s talent. And once they get around to casting the next James Bond, she’ll be responsible for shaking and stirring the 007 franchise for a new generation. Title: Chief Marketing Officer, Universal Pictures Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Moses is one of filmdom’s most respected and well-liked marketing mavens. He has the experience and the No. 1 opening weekends to back it up. His latest victory that impressed fellow CMOs far and wide was his assignment to open not one but two movie musicals tied to a beloved Broadway property with a one-year gap in between. Moses and his team made sure that you couldn’t miss the candy-colored fanfare for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good.” Next up he faces a Homeric challenge with the release of Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” in July. Title: CEO, ITV Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: McCall has carefully managed ITV’s response to the rapidly changing business landscape for media. She took the reins after her predecessor acquired a slew of small production banners to feed the company’s content pipelines. She came in as a strong experienced executive manager who helped quiet the persistent rumors that ITV would be sold, although that may change as another wave of merger mania grips Hollywood. Title: CEO, Canal+ Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Maxime Saada, a shrewd businessman whose mantra is “buy less, own more,” has transformed Canal+ Group from a largely French pay-TV operator into a leaner, financially robust global media company spanning Europe, Africa and Asia. Since taking the helm in 2015, Saada has quadrupled the group’s subscriber base to more than 40 million across 70 countries, while tightening cost structures, cutting losses and sustaining a €5 billion annual investment in content. Saada joined Canal+ Group in 2004 and moved through the ranks, has fueled the company’s growth through targeted acquisitions, including stakes in The Pictures Company in the U.S., Nordic pay-TV group Viaplay and Asian streamer Viu, capped this year by the takeover of MultiChoice Group, cementing Canal+’s leadership in Africa. In parallel, Saada secured a 34% stake in UGC, reinforcing vertical integration alongside Studiocanal, the producer behind “Paddington.” Title: Chairman and CEO, Mediawan Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: In an industry reshaped by consolidation and volatility, Capton has engineered a rare European success story with Mediawan. The self-made French producer co-founded Mediawan with telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse as a special-purpose acquisition vehicle in 2015. Ten years and (likely) over a thousand transatlantic flights later, Capton has turned Mediawan into one of Europe’s leading production-distribution players amid a fiercely competitive market, generating upwards of $1 billion in annual revenues and housing over 80 labels worldwide, including the producers of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Miraculous” and “Call My Agent” — with a movie spinoff in post boasting George Clooney and Eva Longoria cameos, and a U.S. remake set in the sports representation worlds with HBO and SpringHill. Capton has been the architect of this international expansion, gaining the trust of high-profile talent and spearheading headline-making acquisitions that put the company on the English-language map, including majority stakes in Oscar-winning banners such as Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner’s Plan B (“Adolescence,””F1”), and “Slow Horses” producer See-Saw Films. Capton also just enlisted Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap for a joint venture based in London. Title: Founder and CEO, Mubi Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: A Turkish-born film fanatic, Efe Cakarel had never been to a film festival when he wrote the business plan for Mubi in 2007, envisioning an edgier alternative to Netflix. Eighteen years later, the London-headquartered company has evolved from a niche streamer into a full-fledged studio spanning theatrical distribution and production, with more than 400 employees across 15 markets. Mubi broke through in the U.S. with Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror breakout “The Substance,” which it distributed in theaters and grossed $83 million worldwide in 2024. It also earned five Oscar nominations, which meant that the ceremony last March marked Cakarel’s first trip to the Academy Awards. Cakarel, who says he “built Mubi brick by brick,” remains bullish on reinvigorating moviegoing culture. Title: Vice Chair, CJ Group Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: Miky Lee has spent the past two decades building the infrastructure that helped rebuild Korean’s entertainment industry. Appointed vice chair in 2004, she oversaw CJ’s shift from domestic film and TV operations into a vertically integrated entertainment group with reach across Asia and the U.S. Under her watch, CJ-backed projects included Oscar winner “Parasite,” while platforms like KCON and the Mnet Asian Music Awards grew from local showcases into international fixtures. As global demand accelerated, Lee pushed CJ further into the U.S., backing CJ ENM’s majority acquisition of Endeavor Content, now Fifth Season, and the launch of the First Light StoryHouse label with Janet Yang. As Korean film, TV and music have broken firmly into the U.S. mainstream, Lee remains behind one of the few companies built to operate across all three at scale. Title: CEO, Banijay Entertainment and Banijay Live Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: Marco Bassetti is navigating the current age of consolidation without losing sight of the bottom line. As streamer budgets shrink and linear channels lose relevance he is judiciously continuing to grow the company’s footprint while attaining scale with a wide range of premium content. Scale gives Banijay leverage in its negotiations with streaming giants and bolsters its efforts to retain IP ownership rather than selling it outright. The company’s production side, that includes brands such as “MasterChef,” “Big Brother,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Black Mirror,” is looking to expand its reach in English-speaking markets, including the U.S., though Bassetti is not planning to compete directly with Hollywood studios in the scripted sphere. Diversifying beyond traditional TV content, Banijay since 2023 holds a majority stake in live entertainment outfit Balich Wonder Studios that is driving growth thanks to production of high-profile events such as the opening ceremony of the upcoming Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Banijay has also made inroads in the creator-led entertainment space, notably its Creators Lab launched with YouTube. Title: CEO, Versant Media Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Lazarus has taken on the job of transitioning NBCUniversal’s largest linear cable channels into a new company dubbed Versant Media, which will formally become a separate publicly traded entity from NBCUniversal in early 2026. Lazarus is well positioned to steer those outlets — USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy and Golf Channel – into their next chapter given his roots in pay TV as a Turner Broadcasting alum. He’s exiting out of NBCUniversal after a 15-year run. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: NBCUniversal is investing heavily in sports and entertainment franchises. Matt Strauss’ job is to make sure the company makes a profit. NBCU has in recent months tested some unique strategies, including the launch of a new sports-focused cable network that delivers much of the content already available to users of Peacock. The new outlet lets people still connected to traditional systems enjoy the content and serves as a bargaining chip in negotiations with video distributors. Title: President, Sony Pictures Television Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pope has had a broad range of experience over the past 25 years, from rising fast at NBC to helping to launch Chernin Entertainment and Charter Spectrum’s programming venture. All of that background is helping her lead Sony Pictures Television. It’s the studio division that takes the company’s riskiest bets in scripted TV. SPT fielded a notable new series this year for Fox with the medical drama “Doc,” which debuted to strong reviews and audience in January. The series came back quickly — by design — with Season 2 debuting in September just as Season 1 episodes landed on Netflix. Title: Chief Financial Officer, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Wiedenfels is on track to take on the tough assignment of charting a future course for CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, Food Network and other WBD linear channels. If Paramount prevails in buying all of WBD, however, Wiedenfels won’t have an empire. Although the executive became a lightning rod amid WBD’s extensive cost cutting campaigns, Wiedenfels will be sought after as a media CEO after his experience restructuring WBD. Title: President, Disney Advertising Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Ferro has become a key figure in Disney’s TV kingdom as the company opened Disney+ to advertising and has expanded in streaming with ESPN and Hulu. She has deep knowledge of Disney’s operations and the value of Disney’s biggest brands. She’s earned the trust of Disney’s C-suite after delivering for the Mouse House in difficult times. Title: Chairman, Global Advertising and Partnerships, NBCUniversal Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Marshall has grown his stature at NBCUniversal ever since he became the top executive in advertising sales. He distinguished himself in sales for the 2024 Paris Olympics and this year’s “Saturday Night Live” 50th anniversary celebration. He’s also been a driver of the company’s upcoming plans to celebrate NBC’s 100th anniversary and to go big on live sports. Title: President, Roku Media Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Collier was recruited to rev up Roku’s core media business by stepping up original content commissions and enhancing its advertising sales operation. Collier has worked to capitalize on Roku’s strengths by targeting its original series to complement trends and popular shows on channels and apps carried by Roku. He has also expanded its presence on Madison Avenue, tapping into his decades of experience in programming and ad sales. Title: Group CEO, Fremantle Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: If you’re in the business of game shows, then you’re in business with Fremantle. Mullin leads the production banner behind “American Idol,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and a host of game shows ranging from “The Price is Right” to “Family Feud.” On Mullin’s watch Fremantle has also expanded its efforts in scripted content. Title: CEO, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s PlayStation Studios Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Hulst oversees more than 20 individual studio groups and partnerships, which are responsible for some the industry’s most influential games including “The Last of Us,” “Ghost of Yotei,” “God of War,” “Helldivers II” and “Death Stranding 2.” While he was pulled back from serving as co-CEO of the PlayStation business overall earlier this year, Hulst holds significant power in the gaming biz and guides SIE’s film and TV strategy. Title: CEO, Mattel Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Yes, Kreiz is interested in selling toys — lots of them — across multiple different categories (dolls, toddler, preschool and more). But he’s repositioned the company to better exploit opportunities in other lines of business with Mattel’s fan-favorite brands, including with the company’s first movie: box-office bonanza “Barbie,” which indisputably became a cultural moment. He has loaded up more projects in the pipeline in film, TV, consumer products, games, live events and experiences, publishing and music. Kreiz’s background as CEO of Fox Kids Europe, Maker Studios and Endemol over the past three decades affords him a keen understanding of how to capitalize on the value of Mattel’s multigenerational fandoms through media. Title: Founder and CEO, Epic Games Held job since: 1991 Sources of power: Sweeney’s company parachuted into the zeitgeist with the hugely popular “Fortnite,” and the game’s success last year attracted Disney as a major strategic partner. The outspoken — if not combative — exec also has stood up to tech giants Apple and Google, battling them in court to try to force them to make their app store policies fairer for independent developers. Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine 3D graphics platform has been eagerly embraced by professional vfx artists and creators for its ease of use. Title: Chair, Dalian Wanda Group Held job since: 1988 Sources of power: For a decade, Wang Jianlin was the most visible symbol of China’s global entertainment ambitions, snapping up marquee Western assets and building the world’s largest cinema footprint. That expansion unwound after Beijing tightened controls on outbound capital and targeted highly leveraged overseas acquisitions, forcing Wanda into debt restructuring and the exit from assets such as AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment. What remains is narrower but durable. While Wang no longer controls Wanda Film, Wanda Cinemas continue to operate at scale under a brand synonymous with his legacy and are largely housed within Wanda Plaza properties he still owns. Overseas, Hoyts preserves exhibition muscle in Australia and New Zealand. Most resilient is Infront Sports & Media, whose grip on premium sports rights anchors Wang’s influence beyond film. His power now rests in infrastructure rather than dealmaking. The Business of Entertainment

Title: AI trade isn’t dead: An inside look into Wall Street's lucrative data center deals
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/12/23/ai-trade-isn-t-dead-an-inside-look-into-wall-street-s-lucrative-data-center-deals
Time Published: 2025-12-23T17:41:56Z

As fears mount that the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble has popped, Wall Street dealmaking is being kept alive by a fundamental problem: bitcoin BTC$87,480.75 miners and data center developers still require serious amounts of power. “M&A work is still ongoing as people still need power,” said Joe Nardini, head of investment banking at B. Riley Securities, in an interview with CoinDesk. Nardini said demand for power from bitcoin miners remains “huge,” but added that the pull from AI and high-performance computing (HPC) is “even bigger,” with data center and mining clients reporting sustained demand for GPU-ready facilities. After the bitcoin halving cut rewards in half, miners faced a severe margin squeeze even with prices near or above $100,000 and increasingly pivoted to hosting AI and high-performance computing (HPC) hardware in their existing data centers. This helped drive sharp gains in some BTC mining stocks this year as AI hype swept through the market. Read more: GPU Gold Rush: Why Bitcoin Miners Are Powering AI’s Expansion Earlier in 2025, rising concerns about artificial intelligence and lofty valuations erased significant market value from major tech names, including Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI beneficiaries, as investors took profits and reassessed whether prices had outpaced fundamentals. AI infrastructure specialist CoreWeave’s (CRWV) stock also retreated and is now more than 50% below its June peak. Does this mean the AI trend is over? Nardini doesn't think so, and he has some simple logic behind this that he asks executives: Do clients have demand for the data center capacity they’ve built? “Yes.” Do they have tenants? “Yes.” Are they good tenants? “Yes.” Are they getting good rates? “Yes.” Across multiple conversations, he said the message has been consistent: “So the demand is still there.” In fact, Hut 8 shares rallied as much as 20% last week after signing a 15-year, $7 billion lease with Fluidstack for 245 megawatts of IT capacity at its River Bend campus. “Despite the recent selloff, these companies have been well rewarded with higher valuation multiples and the ability to raise capital at attractive valuations and terms," he said. This demand is still underpinning valuations and, increasingly, M&A negotiations, according to Nardini. In competitive situations with high-quality power and viable locations, he said, dollars per megawatt (a financial metric for value for each megawatt of electricity) can look “very attractive.” He stated that one process involved a valuation of over $400,000 per megawatt, with the potential to reach $450,000 per megawatt, depending on the outcome of negotiations. In fact, he has seen prior deals priced as high as $500,000 to $550,000 per megawatt. However, demand for distressed or less desirable locations hasn't gone away and still draws “lowball” bids, sometimes $100,000–$250,000 per megawatt, from buyers who like the power but discount the market or site quality. So who are these buyers and sellers? According to Nardini, buyers include hyperscalers (large tech companies that provide cloud computing infrastructures), AI firms, and bitcoin miners, while the seller universe is expanding beyond crypto-native players. He has seen dealmaking processes involving old industrial facilities, such as a 160-year-old facility, where the primary attraction is power, even if the market isn’t great. In another case, he said a private seller of a similar type asset drew interest from roughly 25 prospective buyers seeking NDAs, including bitcoin BTC$87,480.75 miners, hyperscalers and AI firms. That dynamic is creating an unusual strategic fork for asset owners. Sell to a hyperscaler or developer, or try to become a developer themselves. Nardini said he’s seeing industrial companies with older, idle, or near-idle facilities that have power consider selling into the AI/HPC and Bitcoin ecosystem. He cited another example involving a private client repurposing older office blocks into modular power capacity, “building 30 megawatt units at a clip," and now looking for additional funding to expand. In at least one negotiation, he said, a tenant was even prepared to prepay rent before completion, an illustration, in his view, of how scarce desirable capacity remains. Looking into 2026, Nardini said the setup still favors risk assets if rates fall, calling it a potentially “risk-on environment,” which will be positive for dealmaking in his industry. He acknowledged he may be “talking his book a little,” but said the operating reality he’s hearing from executives keeps him constructive: the tenants are there, pricing remains strong, and if one customer doesn’t take a site, “someone else will.” His caveat to the positive sentiment is simple: if developers can’t lease what they build, or can’t get the price they need, that would be the moment to worry. For now, he says he isn’t hearing that. “The bones of the business remain intact,” he said. He concluded with a blunt assessment of the sentiment. "The demand for power and AI HPC data center capacity continues unabated. Developers with data center capacity have demand from multiple creditworthy tenants at good rates, so the core economics of business remain intact." Nardini said buyers are still hungry for energy, and sellers are seeing good valuations for their assets. This solidifies his conviction further. “The AI trade is still alive as of Dec. 17, 2025,” he said.

Title: 5 MMO Games We Almost Got (And Why They Were Never Made)

Time Published: 2025-12-23T17:30:00Z

By Brandon Zachary Game development on the most basic of titles is tricky enough, but massively multiplayer online role-playing games are a different beast entirely. MMORPGs have to be a big enough world to justify a player’s lengthy time commitment, while also being entertaining and engaging enough to keep them from migrating to other titles. The biggest MMORPGs (like Blizzard’s World of Warcraft and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile) have massive player bases, and there are other consistent titles in the genre like Star Wars: The Old Republic and DC Universe Online. However, there have been some heartbreaking cancellations over the years that resulted in some promising concepts never making it out of development. Here are some of the most exciting MMORPGs that players never got to dive into. Codenamed “Titan,” the Halo MMORPG was sent to bring Master Chief into the RPG space. Developed by Ensemble Studios, the game was initially inspired by the success of Ultima Online. The concept for a sci-fi-heavy MMORPG became a passion project for the developer. After the success of Halo: Combat Evolved, the sci-fi MMORPG was retrofitted into a Halo title and had a number of functional similarities to the hit Blizzard game. Intended to be a rival to World of Warcraft, Ensemble Studios split attention between this game and the RTS adaptation of the Halo franchise, Halo Wars. Although the game pioneered several concepts that would later be brought to life by other MMORPGs, leadership changes at Microsoft and the inevitable investment it would take time to turn a Halo MMORPG into a money maker resulted in the game being shut down. Amazon’s move into the world of gaming was an ambitious play that didn’t end up landing as well as the company had hoped. This resulted in some serious cuts to Amazon’s gaming teams in October. One of the biggest casualties of this was an open-world MMO game set during the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Developed by Amazon Games Orange County (the same team that produced New World: Aeternum), the game was formally announced in 2023 and described as being in early development. While the game would have benefited from Amazon’s resources and the natural connection to Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power TV show, the team reportedly had trouble figuring out how to make the game stand out from other fantasy MMORPGs like Standing Stone Games’ The Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft. Amazon Gaming has shut down many of its games as part of its recent layoffs, with reports suggesting that the Lord of the Rings MMORPG was among the games impacted and shut down by the cuts. EverQuest has been one of the most consistent MMORPG franchises in gaming history, launching in 1999 with the first entry in the series and eventually getting sequels like the PS2’s EverQuest Online Adventures and 2004’s EverQuest II. Formally announced in 2012, EverQuest Next was intended to be a fresh take on the material and would have featured the biggest sandbox world developed at the time. Development carried on for several years under the eye of Daybreak Game Company, which has successfully launched several MMORPGs over the years. Although the game was intended to launch on the PlayStation 4 and was even suggested to have some compatibility with the Oculus Rift, plans for the game came to a halt in 2016. According to the game’s development team, the team couldn’t find a way to make the expansive game “fun,” and the title was cancelled. Fans of EverQuest still have the earlier titles, with the most recent expansion launching in December 2025. Announced in 2010, Rockman Online was a collaboration between Capcom and Neowiz Games. Taking place in the distant future of the Mega Man/Mega Man X series, Rockman Online would have brought back the Maverick Virus and required the construction of several duplicate machines modeled after series mainstays X, Zero, Duo, and Cinnamon to combat the hordes of new corrupted robots. The game was in active development for two years, with gameplay trailers even revealing a 2.5D platforming gameplay style that felt consistent with the franchise’s history. Production moved along far enough that trailers and gameplay clips were revealed to the public, showcasing multiple Mega Man characters fighting alongside one another. There was even a promotional contest to let two lucky winners name characters in the game. However, management shifts at Neowiz Games pushed the game to the back burner, and it was formally cancelled in 2013. Stargate Worlds was an ambitious collaboration by Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment and the MGM film studio. The game was announced in 2006 and was set to be directly based on the cult classic series, Stargate SG-1. Game publisher FireSky became involved in 2008, announcing they were committed to helping bring the best game possible to life. However, in 2009, Stargate SG-1 co-creator Brad Wright (who had been brought into the development as a games creative consultant) revealed his doubts that the game would ever see the light of day. Although there were plans for a closed beta version of the game, and members of the press at the time were impressed by the early previews of the game, Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment filed for bankruptcy in 2010.

Share this article US Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF net flows have remained negative since early November, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The 30-day simple moving average for both asset classes turned negative in early November and has stayed below zero. Glassnode attributed the trend to “a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market.” The firm tracks 11 Bitcoin ETFs, including products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark/21 Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Valkyrie, Invesco/Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree. Its Ethereum coverage includes nine ETFs from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, 21 Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Executive John Ameriks emphasized Vanguard’s core view of the crypto sector hasn’t changed, seeing the asset class as highly speculative. Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant’s begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 2021 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been unbelievably bullish in the past few months. It was supposed to be game over for Tesla once Musk had a falling out with Trump, but TSLA stock is up nearly 120% after bottoming out that spring. It is now higher than it has ever been. Musk was also “vindicated” by a recent ruling where the justices unanimously ruled to reinstate his 2018 Tesla compensation package. It overturned a 2024 decision that voided the $140 billion deal. You’d expect financials to be better than ever, but that’s not the case either. Net income kept falling, and revenue increased by only 11.57% year-over-year in Q3. This is a very modest increase for a stock trading at 219 times 2026 expected earnings. You’re paying exactly 15 times forward sales, so even top-notch margins would keep this stock at expensive levels. This begs the question: Are promises alone driving the stock? Are investors naive enough to buy into the stock in droves without at least some hard figures to reinforce their conviction? This is the hardest part to figure out, and what better way to find an answer than to ask the bulls themselves? Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla can reach $2 trillion. This is the same analyst who sees Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) becoming a $1 trillion company, but a large number of investors share his optimism. His rationale is that Tesla is in a “defining moment” due to Robotaxi and robotics. He believes AI and autonomous driving “could be worth nearly $1 trillion” and generate profits on top of Tesla’s core electric vehicle business. You don’t have to take permabull Ives’ justification for the optimism. Bank of America justified its $471 price target due to the Robotaxi and the Optimus robot. Per its own sum-of-the-parts analysis that runs through 2040, the Robotaxi platform alone accounted for 45% of Tesla’s total valuation, with the Optimus humanoid robot at 19%. TSLA stock has surged past that price target. Another long-term Tesla bull, Cathie Wood, believes 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will come from the Robotaxi business in 2029. It is important to note, though, that Wood predicted a tenfold increase in TSLA’s price all the way back in early 2023, with the bear case at $1,400. Her justification then was full self-driving technology. All things considered, the bulls have a very mobile (pun unintended) thesis for why they see parabolic gains. If Robotaxis end up failing, Optimus or something else that may come up is very likely to take its place. Even though the numbers are not there, the bulls are putting the money where their mouth is. TSLA stock has continued climbing, and the bears have been proven dead wrong in the past year. Wood’s portfolio has Tesla as its largest holding with a 12.2% weight. In the coming quarters, Musk can start working on the numbers as the “anti-Tesla” sentiment has cooled down. Interest rate cuts will also indirectly raise demand for vehicles as they make car loans more affordable. If this coincides with a drawn-out AI rally that lasts through 2026, TSLA stock will be able to reach $2 trillion and beyond. While it’s true that Musk’s promises can get an even higher price tag in the coming quarters, chasing it is not worth it today. Tesla is highly vulnerable to a slowdown of the AI rally. Optimus’ presumed long-term potential relies mostly on AI’s progress on the software side. The robot’s chassis has been remotely controlled by a human in events. If Tesla figures out a way to make it truly autonomous, the sky is the limit. This is unlikely to happen even a decade out, but bulls will keep paying for the prospect as long as AI progress in general remains swift. If not, the dashed hopes will drag TSLA stock down with it. Then there are the Robotaxis. The potential is surely there, but so is the competition. The Waymo + Uber (NYSE:UBER) fleet is larger and more advanced at the moment. Theoretically, Tesla can still dominate if it could make millions of its FSD-capable cars into a Robotaxi fleet overnight. Paying for TSLA stock as if that has already happened is still not a good idea, at least in my opinion. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © websummit / Flickr Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the top hedge funds today. It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important. Bridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too. Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio. The hedge fund increased its position by 4.83% in the third quarter. Bridgewater owns more than 1 million shares of the ETF and started investing in IVV in 2010. IVV has $733 billion in assets under management. The ETF provides exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. IVV invests in the 500 top U.S. companies based on their market capitalization. This means its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. The fund has a yield of 1.04% and pays quarterly dividends. Its highest allocation lies in the technology sector at 34.36%, followed by financials (13.38%) and consumer discretionary (10.56%). IVV has a low expense ratio of 0.03% and has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 94.83% and a 5-year return of 114.12%. IVV has gained 17.09% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $687.83. The fund has the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming years. With more than two decades of history, the fund has established itself as a strong player offering broad U.S. equity exposure. Ja Crispy / Shutterstock.com Bridgewater has the second-highest position in State Street’s S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), which makes up 6.69% of the total portfolio. The fund also tracks the performance of the S&P 500 and is the first exchange-traded fund listed in the United States. SPY is a low-risk investment that ensures steady capital appreciation. It has gained 17.41% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $684.83. The fund holds 503 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.09%. It has a yield of 1.04% and has the highest allocation in the information technology sector (34.08%), followed by financials (13.55%) and consumer discretionary (10.62%). Similar to IVV, its top 10 holdings include industry stalwarts such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Despite making several buy and sell transactions, Dalio prefers to stick to some ETFs, and SPY is one of them. It can help build a strong foundation for your portfolio. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 20.43% and a 5-year return of 15.12%. With SPY, you get to own the biggest companies across industries. IVV and SPY are virtually identical in many ways. Both track the S&P 500 index and have generated similar returns over time. Prykhodov / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) forms 2.53% of Bridgewater’s portfolio and holds more than 3 million shares. While the hedge fund has trimmed its position over time, it still remains one of the top holdings. Looking at Dalio’s holdings, it shows that he’s bullish on the tech sector. Alphabet has gained 61.89% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $308.61. It has a comprehensive AI ecosystem that ensures steady revenue growth. While the company is known for the dominating Google search engine, it has a massive empire that continues to grow. Its search engine continues to lead the industry, while YouTube has become the largest streaming platform today. Its numbers are impressive. It reported a revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% year over year, while the net income jumped 33%. Its cloud revenue soared 34% to $15.2 billion, and Google Services revenue jumped 14% to $87.1 billion. Its cloud division has gained a multi-year deal worth $10 billion with Palo Alto Networks, aimed at expanding the AI-driven security infrastructure. There’s plenty of growth still to come. Wall Street remains bullish on the stock as its core business continues to thrive. A Wedbush analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $350. 2024 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Tech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) forms 2.23% of Dalio’s portfolio. While he has trimmed his stake in the company during the third quarter, Microsoft continues to remain one of the top five holdings. The tech giant has seen a steady climb and continued optimism by Wall Street experts. AI will accelerate Microsoft’s growth, and the demand for Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure has outpaced supply. There’s a lot of talk about Microsoft’s AI rollout across its entire product stack and the expansion of CoPilot in Windows. In the recently announced results, the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. It reported a revenue of $77.67 billion, up 18% year over year, and an EPS of $4.13. Its cloud segment recorded a growth of 28% with a revenue of $30.9 billion, being one of the biggest growth drivers for the business. MSFT stock has gained 15.80% year to date and is exchanging hands for $484.72. It has a dividend yield of 0.75% and has raised dividends every year since 2010. Despite the low yield, it is an excellent dividend stock to own. The company has increased its dividend by 250% in the past decade. However, the stock price has gone up; hence, the yield has dropped. Despite trimming his stake, Dalio believes in the future of Microsoft and has held the stock since 2005. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Ethereum is vanishing from exchanges, and the massive wallets absorbing it prove you aren’t the target audience anymore

Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) broke its 2021 all-time high in August, brushing $4,945 and a $600 billion market cap, while exchange balances hit record lows. Corporate treasuries and spot ETFs now control nearly 11% of the circulating supply. By every structural metric, ETH should feel like it's having a moment. It doesn't. No Bored Apes are selling for seven figures. No TikTok explainers are going viral. The 2025 ETH rally is real, measurable, and entirely clinical. This is a quiet reallocation by institutions treating Ethereum less like a speculative trade and more like yield-bearing infrastructure. The cultural void raises a sharper question: is ETH transitioning from layer-1 casino to institutional plumbing, and what does price discovery look like when the buyers don't care about hype? The supply story is unambiguous. Only 10.5% of all ETH now sits on centralized exchanges as of Dec. 21, one of the lowest shares since the network launched and down 43% since July, per Coinglass data. Additionally, more than 35.6 million ETH is locked in staking as of Dec. 20. BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. This isn't speculative hoarding, but rather an operational infrastructure. Nansen's holder composition shows the largest addresses are staking contracts, institutional custodians, and ETF wrappers, not whale wallets. Exchange float is draining, but not into day-trading accounts. It's moving into pipes: layer-2 bridges, restaking protocols, treasury vaults. Corporate balance sheets tell the same story. Treasury data from Dec. 19 estimates that corporate holders plus spot Ethereum ETFs now control 10.72% of the circulating supply. This is divided in 5.63% in corporate hands and 5.09% in ETFs, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data. BitMine has accumulated over 4 million ETH, equivalent to 3.36% of the total supply, and has explicit plans to reach 5%. These aren't venture bets, but strategic positions tied to Ethereum's role in stablecoin settlement and tokenized asset rails. ETF flows confirm the institutional tilt. Year-to-date, ETPs tracking ETH have drawn about $12.7 billion in net inflows, with US spot Ethereum ETFs representing $12.4 billion. The infrastructure is built. The allocators are here. The 2025 research cycle has started treating ETH as yield-bearing infrastructure rather than a levered bet on tokens. Citi's September note setting a $4,300 year-end target is explicit: the driver is demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins and tokenization, not speculative trading. The bank highlights staking yield as a differentiator for corporate portfolios, sketching a bull case to $6,400 if stablecoin adoption evolves on the optimistic trajectory. Binance Research argued that if stablecoin settlement and layer-2 scaling continue on current trends, ETH's valuation logic shifts from “deflationary asset” to “ecological infrastructure asset.” Data from rwa.xyz shows that Ethereum controls $12.5 billion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market, equivalent to 66.6%. Ethereum's growth in RWA tokenization since 2024 has been stellar, rising from $1.5 billion, representing a 735% increase from its current size. Stablecoin usage also skyrocketed. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum recorded $1.6 trillion in monthly stablecoin transaction volume as of Dec. 21 and $172.1 billion in stablecoin supply. Supply growth is 141% compared to the $71.3 billion seen in January 2024. The thesis emerging from these reports is consistent: ETH is increasingly treated like a yield-bearing, rails-of-the-system asset in professional portfolios. It's about needing Ethereum to function as plumbing for tokenized dollars, securities, and derivatives that institutions are already building. NFTs are the clearest cultural contrast. Data from CryptoSlam shows NFT art sales plunging from nearly $16.5 billion in 2021 to just $2.2 billion in 2025, a drop of roughly 87%. LG shut down its Art Lab NFT marketplace, Tennis Australia's Artball collection saw floor prices collapse by around 90%, and CryptoPunks were transferred to a non-profit, with coverage bluntly observing that the “money-making days” are over. Google Trends data shows that crypto-related searches in the US remain well below prior-cycle peaks, rising to 100 only when prices grind higher between July and August. The participation mix confirms the shift. Retail mania has rotated heavily into US single-stock trading rather than altcoins. Ethereum ETP flows swing between huge inflow weeks and very large outflow weeks, more like a tug-of-war between structured products than a one-way retail stampede. The mismatch between accumulation and attention creates a medium-term puzzle. Traditional price discovery depends on a mix of fundamental flows and narrative momentum. Ethereum in 2025 has the former without the latter. ETFs and treasuries provide slow, steady demand. Staking locks up supply, and tokenization brings real-world assets to Ethereum. But the cultural engine that drove 2021, consisting of retail users treating every transaction like a statement, has stalled. This matters because Ethereum's valuation has always been partly reflexive. The network becomes more valuable as more applications build on it, partly because developers expect it to grow in value. That virtuous cycle depends on momentum, not just infrastructure. When corporate buyers treat ETH as a tool to settle tokenized bonds rather than a bet on the future of finance, they stabilize the asset but flatten its narrative arc. The wire shows ETH buying. The data shows supply draining from exchanges. What's missing is the cultural proof that any of this matters to anyone outside the trade. Ethereum may be transitioning from a speculative layer-1 to financial plumbing, and if that's the case, the 2021 feeling might not return. The question is whether the next phase of steady, institutional, infrastructure-driven flows can sustain the valuations that retail mania once underwrote.

Title: Where Will Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Be in 5 Years?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/23/where-will-broadcom-avgo-stock-be-in-5-years/

Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Sometimes in discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) hardware providers, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets left out of the conversation. Yet, it’s a mistake for technology investors to overlook Broadcom and AVGO stock. Along with the potential for a Broadcom stock split, there may be a value proposition for investors here. In five years, unless there’s a catastrophic event, Broadcom shares could trade much higher than they do today. If that happens, you’ll wish you had gotten in before the rocket ride started. When all is said and done, value investors should open their minds and consider AVGO stock a bargain even if it’s not immediately obvious. At first glance, some investors might not be immediately find Broadcom stock attractive. For one thing, the share price recently pulled back from nearly $415 to $340, representing a scary 18% drawdown. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, if you’re a value investor looking to hold AVGO stock for five years. Maybe the 18% share-price correction was needed in order to bring Broadcom down to a low valuation. This theory is difficult to support with old-school metrics, however. For example, Broadcom has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 71x to 72x, which doesn’t look like a bargain. Furthermore, Broadcom’s forward annual dividend yield of 0.76% probably won’t impress many income investors. Sometimes a share-price pullback will set the stage for a high dividend yield, but this apparently hasn’t happened with AVGO stock. In order to justify a five-year buy-and-hold with Broadcom stock, the company really needs to demonstrate its growth potential. From a financial standpoint at least, Broadcom definitely checked the right boxes with its fourth-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan had every right to brag when he announced the company’s record quarterly revenue of $18 billion, up 28% year over year. Tan further clarified that Broadcom’s revenue growth was “driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74%” year over year. It’s difficult to extrapolate five years out, but clearly Broadcom’s growth trajectory is on a powerful uptrend. If you can believe it, Broadcom’s Q4 FY2025 GAAP-measured net income nearly doubled year over year, increasing 97% to $8.518 billion. Also on a year-over-year basis, Broadcom’s free cash flow (FCF) grew 36% to $7.466 billion while the company’s adjusted EBITDA expanded 34% to $12.218 billion. Given these figures, it’s surprising that Broadcom isn’t a darling of the financial market. So maybe value investors ought to be willing to overlook Broadcom’s seemingly high P/E ratio. Given AVGO stock’s five-year trajectory and the company’s growth pathway, a $500 share price in a couple of years and $800 in five years is entirely possible. Besides, even if the company doesn’t get all of the attention on Wall Street, Broadcom is a power player among AI hardware producers. To cite one example, Broadcom recently introduced the Brocade X8 Directors and Brocade G820 storage network products. The company describes these products as the “industry’s first 128G Fibre Channel platforms designed for today’s mission-critical workloads and enterprise AI applications.” Only time will tell, but these could prove to be major revenue generators as Broadcom expands its array of enterprise AI hardware offerings. Looking ahead, Broadcom anticipates $73 billion worth of AI product backlog over the next year and a half. Deliveries of these products, moreover, should drive 150% year-on-year AI revenue growth for Broadcom in fiscal year 2026. Granted, these are only expectations and not all predictions work out as planned. Ultimately, Broadcom will only succeed and thrive over the next five years if enterprise AI product demand remains robust. The point is that if you see an AI bubble and expect it to burst, then you probably shouldn’t buy and hold Broadcom stock. As the old saying goes, scared money doesn’t make money. However, without an AI hardware market collapse, the runway is clear for AVGO stock to hit $800 in five years. Broadcom knocked it out of the part in Q4 FY2025, and the company’s AI product backlog prediction should boost investors’ confidence. Therefore, it’s fine to keep track of Broadcom’s seemingly high P/E ratio and small dividend, but there’s no need to obsess over these figures. Instead, consider owning AVGO stock after the recent 18% dip and holding your Broadcom shares for five years or longer. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Will XRP Hit $5 in 2026? 5 Catalysts That Could Make It Happen—And 3 Risks That Won’t

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has spent years moving in tight ranges, but 2026 is shaping up as a decisive period. With institutional interest building, new products on the horizon, and macro conditions beginning to shift, investors are asking a sharper question than ever: will XRP hit $5 in 2026? Some believe a clear set of catalysts could finally unlock that level. Others argue that the same risks that held XRP back before still apply. To understand what comes next, it helps to separate what could realistically drive a move for the XRP price to $5 from what could prevent it. Andrey Gorgots / Shutterstock.com XRP reaching $5 in 2026 requires specific drivers working together. Five catalysts are already in motion, and each one addresses a different barrier that has kept the XRP price range-bound. Speculation around a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF sits at the top of the list because of what it represents: scale, credibility, and regulated access. Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows, led by Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. Market observers have pointed out that XRP-linked funds appear less sensitive to short-term macro stress, suggesting a different investor base. While BlackRock stated in August 2025 that it has no immediate plans for an XRP ETF, analysts believe regulatory clarity and sustained ETF demand could change that calculus. If BlackRock eventually moves forward, estimates suggest inflows could reach $2 billion or more. That level of capital would reshape demand and strengthen the case for XRP hitting $5. It would also position XRP as the only crypto asset with an ETF tied to a fully regulated token in the U.S. Japan is quietly becoming one of the most important regions in the long-term XRP story. Ripple and SBI Holdings plan to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by Q1 2026 through SBI VC Trade, pending regulatory approval. The project is being built through licensed trust banks and exchanges under Japan’s Payment Services Act. Japan accounts for more than half of Ripple’s global payment volume. When regulated stablecoins become part of domestic and cross-border settlement, XRPL’s role as an infrastructure gains relevance. Banks using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger create real demand for XRP as a bridge currency. This supports the XRP reaching $5 case, even if the impact builds gradually over quarters. Tokenization is where blockchain adoption moves beyond theory. Ripple’s expanded relationship with Archax—a regulated digital securities exchange—reflects this shift. The partnership aims to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tokenized equities, debt, and funds onto XRPL by mid-2026. Archax operates in a regulated environment and has already shown that tokenized traditional assets can function at scale. XRPL’s fast settlement—transactions clear in 3-5 seconds—and low fees make it suitable for this use case. Traditional securities settlement can take days and cost significantly more. As global consulting firms project tokenized assets reaching trillions of dollars by the end of the decade. If XRPL captures even 5-10% of tokenized asset settlement, the utility demand for XRP multiplies, and this harnesses its case of reaching $5 in 2026. Macro policy remains one of the most important background forces shaping XRP’s upside potential. Expected Federal Reserve rate cuts would lower returns on cash and short-term bonds, historically pushing capital toward risk assets offering growth and liquidity. Large-cap digital assets usually benefit first from this shift, especially those with deep markets and improving regulatory clarity. XRP fits that profile—consistent volume, global recognition, and increasing institutional discussion. Rate cuts don’t cause price rallies by themselves, but they change behavior. Capital becomes more willing to take exposure, and risk tolerance rises across portfolios. In that environment, questions like “will XRP hit $5” move from speculation to portfolio debate as allocation decisions begin to shift. Supply dynamics add another layer to this outlook, and recent on-chain data makes the shift hard to ignore. Exchange-held XRP fell sharply, with 1.35 billion XRP pulled off exchanges in less than two months. Balances dropped from roughly 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than 1 billion leaving in just three weeks. This pace suggests a decisive change in behavior. Large withdrawals signal that holders are moving XRP into longer-term storage—cold wallets and institutional custody—rather than keeping it readily available for sale. While this doesn’t guarantee higher prices, it does reduce immediate sell pressure and tightens available liquidity. If demand rises through ETFs, institutional participation, or settlement-related use while supply remains constrained, price movements can accelerate. This is why exchange outflows feature so prominently in discussions about XRP’s upside potential heading into 2026. Tamisclao / Shutterstock.com Even with multiple bullish drivers in place, there are clear risks that could prevent XRP from reaching higher levels. These risks are structural and they explain why the question of XRP hitting $5 still divides investors. The largest risk remains regulation. XRP’s progress over the past year has been closely tied to improving legal clarity and regulatory acceptance following the August 2025 SEC settlement. That progress underpins institutional interest and ETF-related momentum. However, regulatory environments can change quickly. A tougher stance from U.S. regulators, new compliance requirements, or delays in XRP ETF approvals could slow institutional participation. For large investors, certainty matters more than speed, and any sign of reversal would likely pause capital inflows and weaken confidence. Ownership concentration is another important risk. XRP has a history of large holders selling into strength. When price moves higher, these holders often take profits, increasing sell pressure at key resistance levels. This behavior can flatten rallies even when broader sentiment is positive. If distribution accelerates during a breakout attempt, demand from ETFs or retail investors may struggle to absorb the supply. This dynamic has capped previous rallies and remains a real obstacle to XRP reaching the $5 target. The final risk sits outside the crypto market entirely. A global economic slowdown or recession would reduce appetite for risk assets across the board. In such conditions, investors typically rotate into cash, bonds, or defensive assets. Even strong crypto narratives struggle when liquidity tightens. If recession fears dominate in 2026—triggered by banking stress, geopolitical shocks, or persistent inflation—capital that might have flowed into digital assets could stay sidelined. You can have perfect fundamentals, but if the economy contracts, risk assets like XRP suffer. XRP reaching $5 wouldn’t come from a single headline or short burst of momentum. It would require a rare alignment of multiple forces playing out together. ETF inflows would need to remain strong and consistent, institutional adoption would have to translate into real, sustained capital commitment, macro conditions must stay supportive, supply conditions would need to remain tight, and whales would need to hold rather than distribute aggressively into strength. XRP hitting $5 requires all five catalysts to align while the three major risks stay dormant. BlackRock files an ETF, Japan launches RLUSD at scale, tokenization gains traction, the Fed cuts rates, and supply stays locked up—all while regulators stay friendly, whales hold their positions, and the economy avoids recession. It’s a narrow path, but possible. How many of these factors actually align will decide whether XRP hits $5 in 2026 or consolidates below $3 while building for a later run.

Title: Buffett’s $24 Billion Selling Spree: The 6 Stocks Berkshire Hathaway Dumped

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Mark Wilson / Getty Images Investors began to notice that Warren Buffett began being more conservative with the stock market three years ago, and that streak has continued even as the S&P 500 hit new peaks and beyond. He sold Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN), DaVita (NYSE:DVA), D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), and Nucor (NYSE:NUE) as of Q3 2025. In the first 9 months of this year alone, he sold over $24 billion worth of stocks. Buffett did not offer an in-depth explanation for selling these stocks and largely missed out on the broader AI rally. He said that he does not see many opportunities in the market right now. In other words, he believes the market is overvalued and is okay waiting until it cools off. He can then pounce and buy more on the cheap. Buffett is also due to retire as CEO at the end of this month. Greg Abel will assume his role, and some believe Buffett is building up a cash pile for Abel. Anyhow, let’s take a look at the 6 stocks he dumped in Q3 2025, along with Buffett’s likely motives for doing so. Berkshire Hathaway has been aggressively trimming its AAPL position since Q4 2023. With the exception of Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, Berkshire has sold AAPL shares every single quarter since then. Buffett only had positive things to say about Apple and its CEO, so the issue is unlikely to be Apple itself. It is more likely that he sees the broader market as overvalued and is taking profits. Buffett is sticking to his principle of reducing equity exposure whenever he feels the stock market is overheated. Apple happens to be his largest holding, so it only makes sense that he takes profits here. In Q3, he sold $10.6 billion worth of AAPL stock. Bank of America is another company Warren Buffett has had a long history with. He saved the bank in 2011 with a $5 billion investment as the ripple effects of 2008 weakened it. Back then, he made comments about how he liked the profit-generating abilities of the franchise and wanted to hold that investment for the long term. He has stayed true to that commitment, but his BAC holdings have swelled to the point where it makes sense to start taking profits. He has been selling every single quarter since Q3 2024. He sold $1.92 billion worth of BAC stock in Q3 2025, though his holdings are still worth $29.3 billion. VeriSign is an internet infrastructure business. It has been one of Buffett’s most profitable investments. He started loading up aggressively in late 2012 through mid-2014. Back then, VRSN traded ~$40 per share. He made another timely buy in Q4 2024, where the average closing price was ~$200. The stock ballooned to $266.93, and he almost timed the top by selling $1.2 billion worth of it. This was to keep his ownership below 10%. If his ownership crossed that threshold, it would involve Berkshire with regulatory obligations. Buffett has a long history with this kidney disease treatment company, but he hasn’t added to it since Q4 2014. Shares have been slowly climbing in the past decade, but have lagged the broader market. Recent performance has been quite good, and Buffett has been taking profits since the start of this year. He sold $217 million worth of DVA stock in Q3 2025. D.R. Horton is America’s largest homebuilder. DHR stock makes sense as interest rates are coming down, with many believing homebuilding is set to pick up speed significantly. Buffett, however, ran for the exits. He bought in Q3 2023, and homebuilding stocks went on to do quite well until late 2024. They’ve been quite slow since, and even rate cuts haven’t spurred a considerable rally. He sold $199 million worth of DHI stock in Q3 2025. Again, the sale was timely, with the stock sliding down since. Buffett no longer has any DHI shares in his portfolio. Nucor is a steel producer and recycler. NUE stock has been one of the most interesting names in the past, with sudden, sharp rallies as American steel companies were put under the spotlight multiple times in the past few years. Booming steel prices drove NUE stock to record highs in 2021. Buffett was uninvolved back then, but bought in Q1 2025 and Q2 2025 as the rally cooled. The stock then reversed course, and Buffett is now starting to take profits. He sold 3.1% of his stake in NUE, worth ~$29 million. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later. Warren Buffett is not your typical investor, and his moves have been out of the ordinary in the past few… Classic Buffett Investments? Last week, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) filed its first-quarter 13-F, revealing a strategic portfolio shuffle.

The network’s builders have historically focused on technical accomplishments and an ideal of decentralization so pure, critics say, that they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger economic and political picture. But this year, amidst seismic regulatory developments for the crypto industry, Ethereum has stealthily made huge inroads in arenas it long was perceived to have neglected. From Wall Street board rooms to social media timelines, 2025 was the year Ethereum finally conquered centralized institutions. For nearly half a decade, Wall Street veteran Vivek Raman has attempted to onboard top traditional finance players onto Ethereum. “They all told me to politely leave their offices for four years,” Raman told Decrypt. The executive figured a paradigm shift might come this year, given crypto’s newfound political influence. But even he was blown away by what 2025 reaped for Ethereum at an institutional level. “This year was validation beyond what we would have expected,” Raman said. In January, Raman co-founded Etherealize, an organization dedicated to making Ethereum “the backbone of global finance”. Over the course of this year, he said, centralized institutions have followed three significant trends when it comes to crypto. For one, they all are now “urgently” attempting to expand their businesses onto blockchain networks. Two: They have near-universally embraced Ethereum’s distinctive multi-layer network model as the way to do so. And three—perhaps most crucially—this embrace of Ethereum has come about organically, he claimed. “People have just chosen Ethereum, not because there's a [business development] team, but because it's the right place to do business,” Raman said. The success stories are almost too many to count. Base, the Coinbase-incubated layer-2 network built on Ethereum, has become one of the year's buzziest success stories in Wall Street circles. When financial services mainstay Fidelity began tokenizing assets this spring, it went with Ethereum to get the job done. So did the global banking cooperative SWIFT. And after Robinhood went all-in on offering tokenized stocks this summer, the trading giant opted to create its own layer-2 network on Ethereum. Beyond that, there’s the rest of globe: Upbit in South Korea, Ant Group in China, IHC in Abu Dhabi, Amundi in Europe, and Bailie Gifford in the UK. When those financial institutions—some of the most important in the world—dove headfirst into tokenization projects this year, they all chose Ethereum (generally via layer-2 networks) as the place to do business. Efficiency, automation, reduced counterparty risk, increased access to capital, transparency in some cases, privacy in others—there are many incentives drawing big institutions to crypto. But old school, risk-averse firms tend to move in a pack, and those in finance appear to have collectively chosen Ethereum as the default place to build on-chain this year, following similar moves made in 2024 by market leaders like BlackRock. After years of standing on the sidelines, these firms now feel emboldened to commit to Ethereum chiefly because the crypto industry has been legitimized by the U.S. government, Danny Ryan, an Etherealize co-founder and former Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a legal framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the United States. The law had little to do with integrating complex crypto maneuvers into the traditional financial system (a separate, pending crypto market structure bill covers such issues). But the GENIUS Act blessed the general concept of crypto as permissible, or perhaps more accurately, not impermissible, Ryan said. And ever since, the crypto-cautious dam on Wall Street has burst, with or without market structure legislation. “It didn't say, ‘Hey, all the capital markets you know and love are legal to put on a blockchain,’" Ryan said of the GENIUS Act. “It just said, ‘Hey, you can do things legally on blockchains. It's legitimate.’” “After GENIUS, it's almost like the winds are at our back,” Raman said. It’s not just external actors who have come to see Ethereum differently in 2025. Internally, leaders of the Ethereum Foundation have also made huge shifts this year, in an effort to revamp the network’s global image. “There were a lot of unhappy people internally and externally,” James Smith, the Ethereum Foundation’s head of ecosystem, told Decrypt of the nonprofit’s previous woes. For years, even Ethereum’s advocates complained that the network’s foundation had become mired in an isolated, holier-than-thou “ivory tower” approach—one that turned off key centralized institutions and small-scale crypto founders alike. Smith’s job this year has been to completely reinvent how the Ethereum Foundation engages with the rest of the world. “We’ve become much more intentional about how we engage with institutions in 2025,” he said. “We now have teams whose job is to help serious builders and enterprises plug into Ethereum.” Take, for instance, a new initiative at the Foundation to host one-day conferences focused on appealing to big business. One upcoming event will explain staking to corporate firms in Zurich. Another, in New York, will showcase the benefits of Ethereum’s privacy features to enterprise players. While such outreach might sound like a no-brainer, Smith says these efforts represent a “180 [degree] sea change” in the Ethereum Foundation’s approach. “This is a really big moment for Ethereum,” he said, “which is why this is really needed.” One growing sector that has become increasingly central to Ethereum this year—and thus to the Ethereum Foundation—has been artificial intelligence. As the AI agent economy takes off, Ethereum's developers are betting that bots will eventually become the network’s core user base. This fall, the Foundation launched a full-time team dedicated to AI—which is rolling out collaborations with tech giants including Google. Such alliances might seem counterintuitive for a network that has long pitched itself as a democratic alternative to the hyper-centralized power structures of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. But Davide Crapis, the head of Ethereum’s AI team, doesn’t see the network’s growing popularity among tech and financial elites as a problem. On the contrary, he sees it as an inevitable outcome of the network’s rise to dominance. “The focus needs to be on building the best decentralized technology we can offer,” Crapis said. “When they see the value, they will come.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

In July 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) for adults and the 9th Model List of EML for children. These lists serve as global references for essential medicines that should be universally available, accessible, and affordable. This editorial explores recent updates to the WHO EML lists, with a particular focus on medicines addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We discuss the persistent barriers to equitable access, including economic, regulatory, and logistical challenges; highlight global initiatives aimed at improving accessibility; and propose strategies to bridge the gap in essential medicine access. We emphasize the need for international collaboration, increased funding for research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and global health initiatives to support the development of novel treatments for NTDs, and innovative distribution approaches to ensure these medications reach underserved populations.

Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Essential medicines are chosen according to a population’s health priorities. Selection is made based on disease prevalence, evidence for efficacy and safety, and cost-effectiveness—criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and reaffirmed in 2024 [1,2]. These same criteria were applied to the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) in 2023, which this editorial examines. Since its first publication in 1977, the EML has guided national medicine policies and improved the availability of life-saving medicines to all who need them [3], yet around 2 billion people globally still lack access to essential medicines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1–4]. Recent analyses confirm that affordability challenges remain pressing even in 2025, with essential generics still unaffordable for many households [5]. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are ancient illnesses of poverty that impose a devastating human, social, and economic burden on over 1 billion people annually [2], primarily in tropical and subtropical regions among vulnerable, marginalized populations. Over 90% of NTDs affect LMICs, thriving in environments marked by inadequate sanitation and weak healthcare infrastructure [6]. NTDs include, but are not limited to, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis. Despite their significant impact, NTDs remain underfunded in both research and pharmaceutical industry investments compared to other global diseases. Although NTDs represented nearly 20% of the infectious disease burden in 2022, they still accounted for less than 0.5% of global health Research and Development (R&D) funding [7]. The 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines of the WHO (2023) is significant for its increased emphasis on infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and the equitable medicine distribution. Nevertheless, the primary obstacles to accessing essential medicines in the LMICs remain. This editorial will highlight some of these challenges and illustrate how real-world evidence can be used to address them in the context of policymaking. Although malaria is not classified by the WHO as a NTD [8], it disproportionately affects underserved and vulnerable populations in many LMICs and faces similar barriers to equitable medicine access. Therefore, in this editorial, malaria is included in certain sections as a comparative example to highlight overlapping challenges and potential shared solutions. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) was first introduced in 1977 to assist countries in identifying those essential and cost-effective medicines that should be made available to the population [1]. The list has become a global reference. Updated every two years, the list now informs national essential medicine policies in more than 110 countries [3]. The WHO EML criteria for selecting medicines are: The WHO EML is further divided into two lists: By serving as a global reference, the EML guides procurement, supply chain planning, and policymaking at the national level [1]. It also plays a role in supporting universal health coverage by identifying treatments that should be accessible, affordable, and available to all populations [4]. The 55 new medicines were recommended for inclusion in the 23rd WHO Model List (2023), and 9 existing drugs had their indications expanded. This update focuses on infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and affordability [1]. The 2023 WHO EML includes several additions and revisions that directly impact the prevention and treatment of NTDs. Primarily, the inclusion of pediatric formulations for leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis addresses long-standing gaps in child-appropriate dosing and administration, a key barrier in endemic regions [1,8]. Updated recommendations for antiparasitic medicines enhance treatment efficacy and may help mitigate resistance development [1]. Although malaria is not classified as an NTD, the addition of newer artemisinin-based combination therapies offers lessons in scaling up access to essential medicines for other diseases affecting neglected populations [8]. These updates, while important, highlight remaining gaps; for example, the absence of certain NTD treatments from the core list, limited guidance on affordable procurement mechanisms for LMICs, and the need for stronger links between the EML and national procurement systems [1,9]. The 2023 updates are consistent with the WHO’s efforts to address issues of equity in access to medicines on a global level. However, policy changes and more funding are required for real-world adoption. More than one billion people are affected by NTDs, mainly in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America [2]. These diseases hold and maintain people in the poverty cycle through long-term health impairment, disability, and reduced economic productivity. Some examples are: However, there has been less investment in research and development for NTDs than for diseases that are more common in high-income countries, resulting in the treatment gap and slow development of new treatments [6]. Approximately 2 billion people, especially in LMICs, are still faced with great challenges in obtaining the essential medicines as data shows that over 50% of public health facilities in LMICs experience regular stock-outs [10]. These barriers are a result of economic factors, policy barriers, weak health systems, and pharmaceutical industry factors [4,11]. Despite persisting challenges, global access to essential medicines did not stop improving. WHO reports that global access to essential medicines rose from 50% in 2015 to 65% in 2022 [1]. The upward trend in access demonstrates successful worldwide initiatives, but LMICs continue to face substantial access challenges. The high cost and low health care financing in LMICs is a major factor that limits the access to essential medicines for NTDs. The inability of most national health systems to afford essential medicines has led to stockouts or mimicking donor-dependent programmes [12–15]. Recent WHO reporting and 2025 analyses reaffirm that affordability gaps persist despite progress [5]. Access to medicines in LMICs is frequently hindered by regulatory and logistical barriers. Lengthy drug approval processes delay market entry, while weak procurement and distribution systems contribute to recurring stock-outs of essential medicines. Inadequate quality control and limited regulatory oversight also increase the prevalence of counterfeit or substandard products. Together, these challenges create systemic barriers that prevent timely and equitable access to essential medicines in LMICs [9,16,17]. The lack of profits in the market for NTDs removes incentives for pharmaceutical companies to conduct research and development of new treatments. This market failure can be addressed by public–private partnerships (PPPs), subsidies, and advance market commitments that reduce the financial risks and ensure demand [10]. Funding, tax incentives, and volume guarantees are some of the mechanisms that provide funding and make NTD treatments more attractive to pharmaceutical investors [18,19]. Uncertainty of demand discourages pharmaceutical companies from investing in NTD treatments. Without predictable markets, R&D for low-profit diseases remains unattractive. The financing tool known as Advanced Purchase Commitments (APCs) helps minimize financial risks that come from developing treatments for NTDs. The guaranteed market through APCs gives pharmaceutical companies the necessary certainty to conduct R&D for diseases that generate limited profits. The Global Fund together with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) has implemented APCs to promote vaccine development for malaria and rotavirus while similar models should be used for NTDs [10]. Similar models, if applied to NTDs, could help overcome this barrier and stimulate innovation [18,19] Pricing remains a fundamental barrier to equitable access for NTD medicines. Pharmaceutical companies implement tiered pricing structures which enable them to establish varying medication costs based on the income level of each purchasing nation. While the HIV/AIDS sector demonstrates successful implementation of this pricing model through antiretroviral drugs that maintain affordability for low-income nations, NTD medicines have not benefited from similar arrangements. The absence of transparent fair pricing model and mechanisms creates a barrier for LMICs that must fund NTD programs largely without donor subsidies. Without adaptation of tiered pricing to NTD medicines, affordability remains a critical obstacle to equitable access [5,12–14] Pharmaceutical companies often lack financial incentives to pursue R&D for NTDs, as these conditions primarily affect low-income populations with limited market potential. Tax credits serve as incentives that can motivate pharmaceutical companies to invest in NTD drug development. Governments could provide tax reductions to pharmaceutical companies that dedicate specific parts of their R&D funding to neglected diseases. This approach would help ease the financial burden on companies while enhancing their interest in developing treatments for NTDs. A relevant example is the Orphan Drug Tax Credit in the United States, which successfully stimulated investment in therapies for rare diseases by reducing the effective cost of development [12]. Analyses of the neglected disease R&D landscape highlight persistent financing gaps and underscore the need for targeted incentives to overcome the innovation deficit [18,19]. More recently, frameworks such as the UBC Global Access Principles have demonstrated how aligning innovation incentives with equitable access goals can further ensure that new medicines benefit populations in LMICs [20]. Adapting such tax-based incentives for NTDs could help fill critical innovation gaps and align private sector efforts with public health needs. NTDs are a subset of infectious diseases that account for 19% of global disease burden, yet they have obtained less than 0.5% of global health funding and development funding during the last decade—far less than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria [4,7]. WHO’s initiatives and rising use of real-world evidence attempt to address these deficiencies by providing new approaches to enhance the availability, affordability, and distribution of these potentially life-saving drugs. Notwithstanding these efforts and the increasing momentum in the global fight against NTDs by international health organizations, governments, pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the challenge of equitable access to essential medicines persists. WHO is central in setting up global standards as well as frameworks for action to combat NTDs. Accelerating programmatic action, increasing cross-sectoral collaboration, and strengthening country ownership are the three key strategic pillars of the WHO’s activities in this regard based on the Global Strategy for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2021–2030) [21]. Some of the components are: In countries with high prevalence of certain diseases including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization has recommended preventive chemotherapy and has initiated Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns. In this regard, the 2021 MDA campaign covered more than 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [1] with the assistance of the WHO. The WHO works with organizations like the Global Drug Facility and the Medicines Patent Pool to ensure the availability and affordability of essential medicines that include antimalarials, antiparasitic, and tuberculosis drugs [22]. By voluntary licensing agreements, generic competition, and pooled procurement mechanisms, these partnerships have brought down prices and improved access to medicine in LMICs. For instance, licensing of intellectual property has helped in the affordable procurement of essential medicines in LMICs, resulting in reduced costs and increased treatment coverage [23]. Other global health organizations, including Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), Gavi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have also been involved in financing and delivering essential medicines to WHO. DNDi has provided affordable treatments for leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease and more than 2.4 million people have benefited from the life-saving drugs [7]. Especially, the Gates Foundation has made contributions towards vaccine development Global health R&D funding and large-scale disease eradication including malaria and NTDs initiatives. New antibacterial agents and artemisinin-based combination therapies for malaria were added to the 2023 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and WHO continued to manifest concern towards antimicrobial stewardship [1]. These initiatives are essential but require further global investment and sustainable funding mechanisms to ensure long-term success. Recent drug approvals have focused on NTDs [24] and AMR [25]. For example, Oral Amphotericin B, which has been developed under UBC’s Global Access Principles, has been listed as a WHO priority medicine for visceral leishmaniasis owing to its cost-effectiveness, thermal stability, and safety in the LMICs [26]. Furthermore, Hancock Lab’s immunomodulatory peptides are effective in combating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections thus supporting WHO’s AMR strategy [26]. WHO functions as the primary organization that develops global strategies to combat NTDs. The effectiveness of these strategies depends heavily on how countries execute them. The National Strategic Plan for malaria elimination in India has achieved a substantial reduction in transmission by using MDA campaigns and enhancing diagnostic testing capabilities [27]. The WHO supports Uganda’s MDA program for river blindness, which has effectively decreased the disease prevalence in affected areas [21]. Brazil implemented WHO-recommended Chagas disease control measures for diagnosis treatment and vector control, which led to a decrease in new infections [15]. The WHO collaborated with Senegal to achieve near-eradication of guinea worm disease, which serves as an exemplary model for NTD control [28]. Here, we identify and highlight key policy, financial, and technological innovations that fit into global health strategies and have been endorsed by WHO [21], DNDi [29], Gavi [30], and other international organizations that can help achieve the vision of increasing access to essential medicines for NTDs. In support of and advocacy for these approaches, and consistent with the mission of NGDI, we stress the importance of more partnerships and implementation efforts. Emphasizing the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing in LMICs is to address dependence on imported medicines and increase the affordability of the former. WHO recommends that countries should: While existing PPPs have played a role in NTD drug donations, expanding these collaborations requires additional measures: WHO’s 2023 Essential Medicines List has been updated to address global health needs in 2025, but significant barriers still hinder equitable access to essential medicines for NTDs. To overcome these challenges, we need stronger global and national policy interventions, more funding for R&D, and technology-based solutions. Through improved cooperation and coordination between governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international health organizations, the global health community can enhance availability of essential medicines and work towards the eradication of NTDs.

Stock futures are little changed Tuesday morning after three consecutive sessions of solid gains for major indexes; gold and silver are sustaining their rally, with prices of the precious metals hitting record highs for the second day in a row; a handful of economic indicators are due today, including reports on economic growth and consumer confidence; Novo Nordisk stock is surging after the FDA approved a pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy; and shipmaker Huntington Ingalls Industries stock is surging following news that the Trump administration wants to build new battleships. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a muted open this morning as the market looks to extend a rally that has lifted major indexes back near record highs. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down fractionally in recent trading, after posting gains Monday for the third straight session. The Dow enters Tuesday's session 0.7% away from a new closing high, while the S&P 500 is just 0.3% away from its high. Gold futures hit fresh all-time highs, surging above $4,500 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures ticked higher to $58.05 per barrel and were trading at a two-week high. Bitcoin was at $87,800 recently, after briefly rising above $90,000 on Monday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, slipped to 4.15% from 4.17% late yesterday. Precious metals are extending a rally that has sent gold and silver prices to all-time highs. Gold futures were up 1.2% at near $4,520 an ounce recently, while silver futures rose 1.6% to $69.70, with each trading at record levels for the second straight day. Gold and silver have hit a series of record highs this year amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates. A weakening U.S. dollar and geopolitical uncertainty have also contributed to the gains, as investors have sought out assets that are perceived as safe havens. The price of gold has risen 70% year-to-date, while silver has more than doubled. A slew of economic data is set to be released Tuesday, with a mix of reports that were delayed by the government shutdown and more-current numbers. The report on third-quarter gross domestic product, originally due in October, is due at at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect the GDP report to show that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.2%, down from 3.8% in the second quarter but above the average over the last four years of 2.6%. Also due out Tuesday is the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey for December, which will show how Americans felt about the economy heading into the busy holiday shopping season. Durable goods orders for October, another shutdown-delayed report, and a Federal Reserve report on industrial production in November are also both expected today. Shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) are jumping Tuesday after the Danish drugmaker said it has received Food and Drug Administration approval for an oral version of its popular GLP-1 drug Wegovy. Late Monday, the company said the pill version of Wegovy, which caused patients lose about 16.6% of their body weight on average during a clinical trial, will launch in January in the U.S. The weight loss drug industry has seen Novo rival Eli Lilly (LLY) take the lead in sales growth with its Mounjaro and Zepbound, which proved to be more effective in causing weight loss. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have each been racing to get pill versions of the drugs approved, as the companies believe a wider range of people would be open to taking a pill than getting injections. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares were up 8% in recent premarket trading, while Eli Lilly was down 1%. Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) stock is rising ahead of the opening bell after the Trump administration said that it wants to build new battleships. Navy Secretary John Phelan said Friday that the new ship will be based on a previous Huntington Ingalls design, and that the first ships are expected to be completed by 2028. The company said Friday that it has been given the contract to design and manufacture the new ship. President Trump said Monday that the first ship will be called the USS Defiant as part of his effort to revamp the Navy's fleet of ships into a so-called "Golden Fleet," The Wall Street Journal reported. Huntington Ingalls shares were up 4% in premarket trading, following gains of 5% on Monday and 4% on Friday, each day ending at a record high.

Title: Are altcoins coming back? Why 'Bitcoin season' has staying power in 2026
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-altcoins-coming-back-why-bitcoin-season-has-staying-power-in-2026
Time Published: 2025-12-23T12:15:00Z

Crypto traders and several metrics suggest that an altcoin season is nowhere to be seen as institutions help Bitcoin strengthen its grip on the market. Cointelegraph in your social feed Most altcoins are currently displaying bearish patterns that suggest “altcoin season” is not coming, according to numerous analysts, as Bitcoin dominance begins to rise again. Key takeaways: The Supertrend indicator flashes “sell,” which previously led to a 66% drop in the altcoin total market cap. Rising BTC dominance and a low altcoin season index show no signs of reversal. The ongoing sell-off in altcoins is reflected by the correction in TOTAL2, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC), that began on Oct. 10. Data from TradingView shows that TOTAL2 has decreased by 32% to $1.19 trillion in December from its all-time high of $1.77 trillion reached on Oct. 10. This drop has seen TOTAL2 lose above key support levels, including the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) currently at $1.3 trillion, as shown in the chart below. Related: Crypto altseason unlikely in 2026 as ‘blue-chip survivors’ to win out: Analyst The SuperTrend indicator also flashed a bearish signal when it reversed from red to green and moved above the price in mid-November. This indicator overlays the chart while tracking TOTAL2’s trend, like the moving averages. It incorporates the average true range in its calculations, which helps traders identify market trends. Previous confirmations from these two indicators were followed by 85.5% and 66% drawdowns during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets, as shown in the chart below. Altcoins are still stuck in the downtrend as TOTAL2 consolidates within an ascending triangle. “Altcoin market cap is coiling into a brutal downtrend,” Merlijn The Trader wrote in an X post analysis. Support at $1.15 trillion is holding for now, but “if this triangle breaks, we could see a -30% flush” to $830 billion, the analyst wrote, adding that the “altseason is not coming” until the resistance at $1.68 trillion is broken. “Alt season will never occur again,” wrote CryptoDaddi in a recent post on X, adding that going forward, money will be concentrated into a select few altcoins. Bitcoin's (BTC) grip on the cryptocurrency market has tightened in 2025, leaving little room for altcoins to outperform. After pushing past 65% in June, Bitcoin dominance, a metric measuring Bitcoin’s market share relative to the overall crypto market, dropped to 57% in September. Since then, the metric has been on an upward trend, recording higher highs and higher lows, as shown in the chart below. At the time of publication, BTC dominance is at 59.27%, indicating that it is still Bitcoin season. This metric has not dropped below 50% since September 2023, which has previously marked the start of the altseason. This is a structural shift driven by institutional adoption that came after the approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions from traditional finance. Institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity prioritize Bitcoin for its adoption, relative stability and regulatory clarity, viewing altcoins as riskier and less liquid. It’s not just aggressive buying by Strategy either. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF attracted over $25 billion in inflows in 2025, reinforcing the preference corporate buyers have for BTC over altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is printing a higher low, and money is rotating back into BTC, not alts,” said CyrilXBT in an X post, adding: Meanwhile, key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it’s still nowhere in sight. According to Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index, only 21% of the top altcoins have outperformed BTC during the last three-month period, suggesting capitulation among altcoin holders. Additionally, the Crypto Market Breadth, a measure of market strength, reveals that only 8% of all altcoins are trading above their 50-day moving average, suggesting that the altcoin market is extremely weak. Similarly, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 18 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin season is when the percentage is above 75%. “CMC Altcoin Season Index is at a record low,” said altcoin trader Money Ape in an analysis on X, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has outperformed most other cryptocurrency sectors in recent months, indicating that capital and investment continue to favor Bitcoin.

Title: Paramount's new offer for Warner Bros 'not sufficient'
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1223/1550321-paramounts-new-offer-for-warner-bros-not-sufficient/

Paramount Skydance's latest offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery still is not good enough for prominent shareholder Harris Oakmark, the investor has told Reuters. Warner Bros' fifth largest shareholder, owning 96 million shares or about 4% of shares as of the end of September, said it would hold out for more from the Ellison family-controlled Paramount. "The changes in Paramount's new offer were necessary, but not sufficient," Harris Oakmark portfolio manager and Director of US Research Alex Fitch said in an email to Reuters. "We see the two deals as a toss-up, and there is a cost to changing paths. If Paramount is serious about winning, they’re going to need to provide a greater incentive," he added. Paramount yesterday amended its $108.4 billion hostile bid for the storied Hollywood studio to bolster its financing. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David owns Paramount, is now personally guaranteeing $40.4 billion of the bid to secure Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max and controls the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Superman franchises. Questions about the financing, much of which was held in a revocable trust, had some Warner Bros investors unsure whether they would accept the offer. Paramount also increased the fee it will pay to $5.8 billion from $5 billion if regulators do not approve the deal, to match a competing offer from Netflix, although it did not raise its $30-a-share bid. Warner Bros investors now have until January 21, extended from January 8, to accept or reject the so-called tender offer. The board of Warner Bros unanimously recommended on Wednesday that shareholders reject Paramount's earlier bid in favor of Netflix's offer, saying the financing didn't provide a "full backstop." Even though Netflix's cash offer of $23.25 a share is lower, the board said its bid was superior because the financing was more secure and it includes $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock as well as whatever Warner Bros can get when it spins out Discovery Global as part of the deal. The bidding war speaks to the quality of Warner Bros assets, said Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of Chicago investment firm IHT Wealth Management, which owns 16,000 shares of Warner Bros, 6,500 shares of Netflix and 60,000 of Paramount. "It’s really rare to get an opportunity to add top shelf media assets to your portfolio," he said, adding that he'll likely follow the board's advice on the sale. "They know the business inside out and have a better grasp of the nuances associated with the deal than we do." Investor Thomas Poehling, who owns 484,000 shares of Warner Bros and 639,000 of Paramount, said he will likely take the revised offer if Netflix does not counter because Paramount has a better chance of winning approval from regulators. Ellison's guarantee "adds a lot of stability to that offer and that removes a lot of the financing uncertainty," he said. Gheriani and Poehling are not the only investors to hold shares in the rival movie studios. Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock are Warner Bros' three largest shareholders, controlling at least 22% of the company between them. All three are also among the top ten investors in Paramount and Netflix. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Journalists adore the CEO of the world’s largest retailer. All hail Doug McMillon. Since his announcement in mid-November that he plans to retire early next year as the chief executive of Walmart, McMillon has been basking in tributes. During his 12-year reign atop the world’s largest retailer, Walmart’s annual revenue has increased by nearly $200 billion, to $681 billion. Its stock price has risen more than 300 percent, handily outperforming the S&P 500. And its market capitalization has surpassed $900 million. What those numbers conceal, however, is Walmart’s contribution to the nation’s stark economic divide. And the press has blithely ignored it. “Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, will step down on Jan. 31,” The New York Times bullishly observed, “completing a 12-year run that moved the company from a staid brick-and-mortar retailer to a formidable challenger to Amazon, making the big-box store the envy of many in the retail industry.” McMillon “leaves Walmart in a strong position after years of work repositioning it as a formidable digital player and more competitive employer.” “I can’t overstate how difficult it is to take a company with such a strong legacy and make it competitive in today’s environment, given the pace of change,” Joanna Starek, an adviser to chief executives, told the Times. In an effort to improve its relationship with its 2.1 million workers worldwide, the paper went on, Walmart under McMillon “has boosted wages as it sought to compete for talented employees, raising both its base salary for US store managers and starting hourly wages for its store workers.” The company “has also started to win over a new type of customer who may go to its website for delivery of not just low-priced clothing, home goods and groceries but also items like the $4,000 Louis Vuitton bags it now sells.” Some pertinent details were missing from the Times account. While wages at Walmart have increased under McMillon—from an average of $12 an hour in 2015—they are still very low. The average hourly rate of a “field associate” (as Walmart calls its cashiers, stockers, and other hands-on workers) is just over $18, which works out to about $36,000 a year—far below a living wage in most of the country. In 2023, Walmart adopted a new wage structure under which most new employees would receive the lowest possible wage for the store hiring them—as little as $14 in some regions. Walmart did expand other benefits, including parental leave, job training, and free college and technical education. It did so not out of any burst of benevolence but rather a need to reduce turnover, which was proving costly. Even with the wage increase, Walmart pays less than other retailers, including Costco (where starting clerks earn $20 to $21 an hour and top-tier ones $32) and Target. In surveys of worker satisfaction, Walmart significantly lags both those retailers. McMillon’s compensation for the year ending February 1, meanwhile, totaled around $27.4 million ($1.5 million in base salary plus stock awards and bonuses). Walmart’s top six executives received a combined compensation of about $100 million. In addition, McMillon owns more than 4 million shares of Walmart stock, worth about $500 million. In the view of The Wall Street Journal, McMillon was worth every penny. “Why CEOs Get Paid So Much,” ran the headline over an editorial extolling his tenure. It cited McMillon’s expansion of Walmart’s e-commerce business, his integration of AI into store management, and his adept managing of Trump’s tariffs. In addition to the spurt in the company’s stock, the Journal observed, Walmart “has increased wages and benefits” for its workers. Noting that big business today is a political target on the left and the right, it urged readers to “compare the wealth created over the last decade by Walmart and the performance of the federal government, and weep for the feds.” While Walmart’s success wasn’t the result of McMillon alone, “its profits have allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans to buy homes, pay tuition, and save for a comfortable retirement. The Gen Z socialists now rising in politics won’t admit it, but they are living off the prosperity created by wealth creators like Walmart’s CEO.” That last comment seems as clueless as it is snide. However, much today’s young progressives might have benefited from a rising stock market, they know how unevenly those benefits have been distributed. About 40 percent of Americans own no stock, and among those who do, the holdings are sharply skewed. The top 10 percent of the population owns more than 90 percent of all stock, while the bottom 50 percent owns but one percent. Not many of them can afford the $4,000 Louis Vuitton bags Walmart is now selling. The Waltons can. The descendants of Sam Walton, Walmart’s founder, the Walmart family is the richest in not just the United States but the world. Walton’s children and grandchildren control about 45 percent of the company’s stock and together are worth $450 billion. Sam’s three children—Jim, Rob, and Alice—are each worth more than $100 billion and rank among the top 20 on Forbes’s list of the 400 richest Americans. Alice is the world’s richest woman. This is shareholder-driven capitalism at its most grotesque. And here’s the fundamental fact: The wealth of the Waltons is directly related to the struggles of Walmart workers. By keeping labor costs down, the company can keep its earnings per share up, and that boosts its stock price. Over the last half-century, executives and shareholders have siphoned off an ever-larger share of national income from retail clerks, forklift operators, and delivery drivers. Whatever raises manual workers at Walmart and other companies have received, their earnings still do not support a middle-class life, fueling frustration with capitalism, fascination with socialism, and a fragmenting of society. On December 9, Doug McMillon was in New York to ring Nasdaq’s opening bell. He was celebrating Walmart’s move to that exchange after more than 40 years on the New York Stock Exchange. Joining the tech-heavy Nasdaq was part of its rebranding as a company committed “to innovation and growth as a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer,” as he clunkily put it. That same morning, McMillon appeared on Squawk Box, the morning financial talk show on CNBC, and—even by the welcoming standards of that show—he was treated with reverence. “We’ve known each other for a long time,” said cohost Andrew Ross Sorkin. “How long have you been thinking of leaving?” “Are you going to write a book?” asked fellow host Joe Kernen. Kernen noted that the company was raising wages. “Our associates are doing well,” McMillon said. “And managers do well,” put in the third host, Becky Quick. “Does the Walmart employee think the system is working?” The Nation Peter Olney and David Bacon Elizabeth Spiers Photo Essay / Gabriella N. Báez, The Nation, and Magnum Foundation “People can become managers,” McMillon said. (Walmart in the United States has 4,600 managers—one for each store—which means that about a million and a half employees do not become one.) Mentioning Sam Walton, Kernen said that “it’s a marvel what he did for the American dream.” “We have to keep it going,” said McMillon. “You’ve been a phenomenal leader,” said Quick, “not just at the company but for American values.” “You guys have helped us, educating us,” McMillon said. Not so much the American people. In the coverage of McMillon’s retirement, the perspective of labor was almost completely absent. Journalistic accounts should come with a warning label: No workers were interviewed for this story. In this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you. So many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government. And as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States. At a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society. We couldn’t do this crucial work without you. Through the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away. Time is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year. Another world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!

Title: 7 Rising Stars who took Wall Street by storm after starting their careers in sports, science, and engineering

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Most people imagine Wall Street careers beginning in familiar ways: internships at major banks, economics coursework, and early exposure to markets. But some of the young professionals on Business Insider's 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street list started out somewhere entirely different, long before entering finance. One hoped to be a professional football player. Another was a collegiate golf champion with a goal of playing on all seven continents. A third conducted anthropology fieldwork in Sierra Leone. And another began in a chemistry lab before deciding research wasn't the right fit. We're looking back at this year's cohort, focusing on those whose formative professional years were spent far from trading floors and deal teams. Today, this group has gone on to find success across a spectrum of industry niches from investment banking and private equity to hedge funds and quantitative investing. Below, we're showcasing seven Rising Stars who switched careers, and how those beginnings helped steer their professional climb at firms like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and more. Their backgrounds are organized alphabetically by their last name. Lamar Cardinez, Blue Owl Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy. He thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance. After earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams. Cardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Catherine Kress, BlackRock Kress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making. Kress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a "dream job." She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute. But she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the "culmination" of her career, offering "unparalleled exposure" to global policymakers and business leaders. Jack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase Levendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron. In that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions. Josef Menasche, Goldman Sachs Menasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries. Today, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' secondaries advisory group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions. Aman Mittal, Moelis Mittal began his career studying electronics and communications engineering in India before joining Bain & Company as an analyst in its technology, media, and telecom practice. He later moved into digital-infrastructure advisory work and, at Moelis, has worked on more than 15 data-center-related transactions totaling more than $25 billion in value. His recent mandates include Apollo's acquisition of Stream Data Centers. And he helped Prime Data Centers, another platform in the space, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake to the institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. Nikunj Jain, Bridgewater Jain studied machine learning, taught undergraduate math, interned at Apple in machine learning engineering, and worked for the Department of Defense before joining Bridgewater, where he's now head of Asia research. After graduating from UC Berkeley in two and a half years, he pursued quantitative finance after a friend suggested it. He said he found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked" — a description he's shaken off by running a 15- to 20-person team synthesizing regional activity into trading signals at the giant hedge fund. Jackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley Before joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she told Business Insider. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." So she made the pivot to Wall Street. After holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks. Golf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents. Jump to

Title: Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g907zekllo
Time Published: 2025-12-23T06:01:14Z

The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. "Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target," they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was "really, really important", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. "The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data," he said. Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. "I think the two Kevins are great," Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for "regime change". Warsh had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. "He thinks you have to lower interest rates," Trump told the Journal. "And so does everybody else that I've talked to." Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him "great", adding that "he's a man who's been there a long time". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as "the more sensible choice", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success.

Title: Wall Street’s bid on crypto dominated 2025 but what’s the demand outlook for 2026?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-street-ruled-crypto-in-2025-what-s-the-demand-outlook-for-2026
Time Published: 2025-12-22T23:06:27Z
Full Content:
Fed policy shifts and crypto-friendly regulation point to a bullish 2026, but AI risk, ETF flows and consumer stress could test demand. Cointelegraph in your social feed 2025 was a blockbuster year for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market as crypto-friendly legislators platformed growth-focused regulation and Wall Street finally accepted Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and numerous altcoins as a valid asset class worthy of inclusion in an investment portfolio. The global bid on Bitcoin, Ether and Solana’s SOL (SOL) token was near immeasurable, with total net flows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching $57 billion and the total net assets across the ETFs reaching $114.8 billion. Going into 2026, the real question is whether the pace of institutional, corporate and government-level adoption, which were critical price drivers in 2025, will continue. Since October, the robust inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETF tapered off and, in some cases, turned into a sellers' market for weeks on end, and this was followed by a 30% correction in BTC and 50% in Ether. In an interview with Schwab Network’s Nicole Petallides, Cointelegraph head of markets Ray Salmond said that the crypto market’s performance in early 2026 will depend on a range of factors. .@Cointelegraph's Head of Markets Ray Salmond tells @NPetallides that he expects bitcoin, ethereum and solana demand in the spot and ETF markets to set the tone for the industry in 2026.For more market news, tune into: https://t.co/PYaqKPRp8C pic.twitter.com/ZCp1EIXyUh Beyond the ETF flows and demand across spot markets like Binance and Coinbase, investor sentiment regarding the immense size of the AI industry buildout and the performance of the tech-heavy S&P 500 is likely to have a direct impact on crypto markets. The AI buildout, company valuations, fundraising, IPO performance and whether datacenter hyperscalers continue to propel the equities markets alongside MAG7 will remain at the forefront of everyone’s mind. In the interview, Salmond said rapid balance sheet expansion was a strategy that supercharged tech-related equities in 2025 as hyperscalers spent double-digit billions on data centers, compute, Nvidia GPUs and energy. At some point in 2026, the expectation will be that these companies demonstrate that they can monetize their investments, or at least finance the expansions from their internal cash flow. In the latter half of 2025, Oracle, Meta and Nvidia saw their stock prices fall as the market questioned whether there was a chance that some of these companies’ free cash flow could go negative. If investors smell smoke related to debt-heavy, cash-poor AI and quantum computing companies in 2026, there’s likely to be some negative reaction. How these shockwaves carry over to the SPX, DOW, and, by proxy, crypto is something investors will need to keep on the watch list. A bullish event worth watching in the early part of 2026 will be whether or not the Clarity Act becomes law. The crypto lobby aimed to have this act passed into law before the end of the year, but the lengthy government shutdown delayed progress on hammering it out. If passed, the Clarity Act will provide clearer rules and the necessary environment for FinTech innovators to sandbox in the US, and the hope is that more offshored crypto businesses will headquarter back in the United States. It will define which regulatory bodies (SEC and CFTC) have jurisdiction over various crypto assets, depending on whether they are classified as securities or commodities. There’s also a strong emphasis on consumer protections, and a better framework in this area could provide the necessary transparency that businesses and consumers need to confidently invest in crypto assets. The Federal Reserve’s policy shift is expected to further morph into an easy money regime, and US President Donald Trump’s early 2026 Fed chair selection is anticipated to bring up to 100 basis points in rate cuts. According to Salmond, Salmond explained that “the job market is softening and this cooling trend is predicted to carry on in 2026. The ‘transitory’ impact of the Trump tariffs has resulted in elevated goods and services costs, health insurance premiums will rise, and retail investor confidence may drop as layoffs are announced, consumer debt rises and disposable income falls.” At the same time, “investors expect Fed rate cuts to result in lower mortgage rates, compel banks to loosen the purse strings for lending and lure consumers to go buy more stuff. But, the potential return of easy money policy and big government spending essentially confirms that the US is kicking the debt bomb further down the road.” Related: JPMorgan explores crypto trading for institutional clients: Report In Q1 2026, the dilemma investors will have to contend with is whether there are signals that prove that the Fed's easy money trade is being front-run and possibly sold on confirmation, or will the evolving Fed policy also reinvigorate the bull market seen across equities in 2025 and extend to crypto? Investors who prioritize optionality and a nimble footprint should be able to avoid some of the pitfalls of a narrative and speculation-driven market, where the MAG7 and AI markets could prove to be overvalued. On paper, the big picture view for 2026 is bullish, especially when considering the Trump economic mandate, Fed policy and crypto-friendly regulation, but it’s the unknown outcomes of the AI buildout and the actual impact of rate cuts on the consumer and economy that are going to determine the direction markets take in Q1 and Q2.

December 22, 2025 17:50 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 December 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Wegovy® pill (once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events*. The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2. In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1. The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1. The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025. About the OASIS trial programmeOASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.OASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities. About Wegovy® Wegovy® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition. Wegovy® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities. Wegovy® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

Title: Google tells staff it will ramp up green card applications again in 2026. Here's who won't be eligible.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google told employees it will be "ramping up" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card. The company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider. PERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US. Tech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to "significant" delays, Business Insider reported. According to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience. The memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered. "Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible," the memo read. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role. Google paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. The sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers. Google applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said. Google told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said. It also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are "not in good standing" with the company. "Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM," it read. MI means "moderate impact" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews. Have something to share?

Please let us know The Business Topic:Reserve Bank Of Australia Interest rates fell, inflation kept surprising and the AI billions and trillions kept flowing: world stock markets had a party. (Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets. "Markets reacted, fearing it could tip the US economy into recession," he recalled. What came next was the so-called "TACO trade" — standing for Trump Always Chickens Out — when the negative impact of deals or ideas became known. "We didn't get a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade wars. So most countries … basically rolled over and accepted the tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on them," says David Bassanese. (ABC News: John Gunn) "We have seen that. He has scaled back the tariffs through the course of the year. He's announced some deals with countries," Mr Bassanese said. Our nation is heavily exposed to moves in global trade — particularly commodity markets that set the price for exports like iron ore and gold. But at the start of the year, a huge focus was placed on a boardroom in a temporary office in Sydney, where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board was meeting to set interest rates. At the start of the year, anticipation of a cut to official interest rates was intense. The RBA had hiked the cash rate to 4.35 per cent in November 2023 and held it there through 2024. With around one-third of Australians servicing a mortgage — and a further third renting, many from landlords with mortgages — the public was feeling the pain of higher repayments. Consumers slashed their spending as the cost-of-living crisis kept chomping at household budgets. "There was undoubtedly a lot of tension," said independent economist Nicki Hutley. "Part of the reason [households] were doing it tough wasn't just interest rates, it was higher-than-usual inflation." "We're very tightly poised", said independent economist Nicki Hutley, between lowering inflation without risking some significant rises in the unemployment rate. (ABC News: John Gunn) By late 2022, consumer prices were rising at a rate of 7.8 per cent a year. That tempered this year, with price rises at one point slowing to 1.9 per cent, below the 2–3 per cent target range the central bank was aiming for. The RBA cut the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points in February, May and August. "The pressure was there because we could see inflation was coming down, we could see the economy was really, really sluggish," Ms Hutley said. NAB's Ms Auld said the impact of a lower cost of money was flowing through the economy, with stronger consumer spending and higher housing prices. "The challenge has been that the recovery that we've got is already starting to lessen the scope for inflation to fall," she said. Most market watchers have now changed their initial view that the RBA would cut rates further in the final months of 2025 or the start of 2026, as inflation has ticked up, once again rising above the central bank's 2–3 per cent target. Mr Tharenou has what will be an unpopular view for people with big outstanding debts — interest rates are more likely to go up than down. It's a view shared by a growing cohort of economists, and expressed by RBA governor Michele Bullock herself. "I think begrudgingly the RBA is going to shift towards raising the cash rate by the middle of next year," Mr Tharenou said. AMP has forecast rates to remain on hold through 2026, with the risk skewing towards a hike. Dr Oliver said in order for a rate cut to be back on the table, unemployment would need to rise. In the most recent data, the unemployment rate remained at 4.3 per cent in November, down from 4.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in September. At the end of 2024, both the trend and seasonally adjusted measures were 4 per cent. The RBA's rate-setting board next meets on February 2 and 3. "Liberation day" might have sounded like freedom but the initial reaction of global stock markets was unrestrained panic. In New York, the S&P 500 index wiped $7.5 trillion in value in the two days after the announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 22 per cent from its December 2024 record close and the Dow Jones, European indices and Australia's markets fell more than 5 per cent. "The push-pull factors in markets this year have been a) Donald Trump and tariffs, but b) the positive of the AI boom," said Betashares's Mr Bassanese. Massive investments in artificial intelligence, data centres and computer chips propelled the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech companies most exposed to the boom — Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook's parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The stock price of the latter has rocketed more than 1,200 per cent after its computer chips — originally powering the visuals of gaming computers — became the bedrock of an AI boom. Nvidia leapfrogged Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, and the first to be valued at more than $US4 trillion ($6 trillion). It's what George Tharenou of UBS describes as an "up-crash". "It's almost a detachment from fundamentals," he said. "We haven't really had a boom in the real economy, but we have had a boom in asset markets." "People call it FOMO [Fear of Missing Out]. The higher the price, the higher the demand. People just want to get into asset markets and not miss out." Despite a recent dip, the ASX 200 index of our largest companies is up close to 5 per cent year-to-date. That makes sense to Shane Oliver of AMP. "We've seen the interest rate cuts, we've seen profits, particularly in the US, continue to surprise on the upside. And even though conditions have been on the soft side [in Australia], we've avoided recession". The runaway performance of the "Magnificent Seven" has brought fears of a repeat of the late-1990s, early-2000s dot-com market crash. But there's a key difference, said NAB's Sally Auld. While the dot-com bubble and the subsequent burst were driven by hysteria around companies trading at really expensive valuations despite being "yet to turn a dollar", Ms Auld said, "that's definitely not the case this time around". Bolstering that case is the mind-melting amounts of money being spent on data centres, factories and technology to power the AI revolution. "I think that number is now close to $500 billion, which is a huge number, and really forcing people to accept that this is a new innovation cycle," she said. The capital expenditure has been so large that it has put a so-called floor under the growth of the US economy. "Somewhere between 40 to 50 per cent of [gross domestic product] growth in the first six months of this year in the US can be accounted for by that huge AI capex spend — it's helping to prop up equity markets." The potential impact remains huge. So is the risk. "We're all openly talking about the fact that there are bubbles and almost thinking that it doesn't matter, that somehow, mystically, this time will be different," economist Nicki Hutley said. George Tharenou is another who isn't convinced the gains are justified by fundamentals. "It's almost the opposite of the law of economics," says Mr Tharenou, describing this year's market behaviour.

Please let us know The Business Topic:Reserve Bank Of Australia Interest rates fell, inflation kept surprising and the AI billions and trillions kept flowing: world stock markets had a party. (Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets.

Title: The biggest games industry news stories of 2025 | Year in Review

Time Published: 2025-12-22T18:33:46Z

AI outrage, a delay to GTA 6, takeover deals for EA and Warner Bros., US tariffs, the Steam Machine, Switch 2… there's a lot to get through Join us as we journey back through 2025 via the biggest games industry news stories of the year, including massive takeover deals, the closure of historic studios, big hardware launches, big hardware reveals, and a lot of bother about tariffs. Following the catastrophic failure of Concord in 2024, Sony pulled back further from the live-service strategy it had embarked upon under the leadership of Jim Ryan, who back in 2022 said that through "close collaboration between Bungie and the PlayStation Studios, we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026." In January, Sony confirmed the cancellation of two unannounced live service titles from Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games; this and other high-profile live-service failures and cancellations led Rob Fahey to suggest that the industry's decade-long race for live-service riches was finally over. In an interview in January, Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, gave further details about the plans to make Xbox first-party titles available across other platforms. "There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," he said. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would go on to launch on PS5 in April, and in July it was reported that six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation from April 6 to July 5 were published by Microsoft. In October, something that would have once been unthinkable happened – Halo: Campaign Evolved was announced for PS5. Warner Bros. Games announced the closure of Warner Bros. Games San Diego, Player First Games (maker of MultiVersus), and Monolith Productions in February. Monolith had been in existence for more than 30 years, and was behind such titles as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. At the time of its closure, the studio was working on a new Wonder Woman game, which has now been cancelled. Although total layoff figures were down by around a third in 2025, the year saw the closure of a number of studios, including Ubisoft Leamington and a range of NetEase developers: see our feature looking back at the year in layoffs for more details. On the same day as Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct presentation (April 2), US president Donald Trump announced punitive tariffs on goods arriving from dozens of countries, causing a rush of speculation on how this would affect the games industry. Nintendo quickly moved to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States; they finally went live on April 24, with the console's US price unchanged, but with Switch 2 accessories rising in price "due to changes in market conditions." Sony said it was considering manufacturing PlayStation 5 consoles in the US as a result of tariffs, and retro handheld maker Anbernic suspended shipments to the States. Nintendo later hiked the US prices of the original Switch by up to 15%, and the US saw similar price rises for the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Rob Fahey suggested the US tariffs "will likely force a strategic shift around the next generation of console hardware." In May, a US court enforced an injunction which prohibits Apple from collecting fees on app purchases made outside its App Store; the landmark ruling is likely to change the app landscape. The previous month, Apple was fined €500 million ($568 million) by the EU for deterring third-party payment methods on the App Store. Similarly, Google made changes in October to allow third-party payment systems after a US court ruling said Google could no longer restrict customers to using Google Play Billing. Then in November, Google and Epic Games agreed on a deal that will potentially pave the way for third-party app stores to be made available on Android worldwide. The Savvy Games Group subsidiary Scopely officially closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Niantic's game business on May 29. The deal included Niantic's entire game development team, the games Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, and the apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Scopely was previously acquired by the Saudi Arabian multinational game investment group Savvy Games Group back in July 2023 for $4.9 billion. Nintendo launched the Switch 2 on June 5, which went on to sell over 3.5 million units in the first four days and 10.36 million units in its first four months, doubling the figures for the original Switch over the same timeframe. However, questions were soon raised about the relative lack of indie games, the seemingly slow rollout of dev kits, and the use of Game-Key Cards in terms of game preservation. Plus, the Switch 2's initial sales momentum seemed to wind down towards the end of the year: in the US, Circana reported that the combined sales of the Switch and Switch 2 in November were 10% lower than the sales of the Switch in the same period last year. The co-op climbing game Peak from Aggro Crab and Landfall became a breakout hit on Steam in the summer, notching up 10 million sales by the end of August. Not bad for a game that evolved from a month-long game jam. Peak was part of a wave of indie co-op games that hit it big on Steam in 2025, with titles like RV There Yet? shifting 1.3 million units in a week and REPO selling more than 12.3 million (according to Video Game Insights). Other indie titles that became unexpectedly huge on Steam included Dispatch, Megabonk, and the drug-dealing simulator Schedule I. The leadership team of Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds was removed by owner and publisher Krafton in July. There followed a very public falling out and subsequent legal action, with claims and counter-claims being thrown back and forth by Krafton and the former Unknown Worlds employees: you can follow the whole saga here. Another big legal battle kicked off in July when Sony sued Tencent, alleging the latter's game Light of Motiram is a "slavish clone" of its tentpole Horizon series. Tencent subsequently accused Sony of seeking a "monopoly on genre conventions," before eventually settling with Sony in December. Microsoft initiated a huge round of job cuts in July, affecting around 4% of the company's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in the games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Rare's Everwild was cancelled, along with an unannounced ZeniMax MMO. In an opinion piece at the time, Lewis Packwood said: "It's hard to dispel the feeling that these cuts are simply part of a disordered retreat." The games industry as a whole saw more than 9,000 layoffs in 2025. Members of the US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted to end its 11-month strike in July, after reaching a pay agreement and ensuring "safety guardrails and gains around AI." The strike began in July 2024 in a bid to protect voice actors as more and more studios explore generative AI. However, as GamesIndustry.biz revealed in a feature in December, contracts for game actors still remain a nightmare in the UK. The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) came into force in July, requiring companies to ensure that their games use highly effective age verification. However, some game firms struggled with the complexities of the OSA, with many having to rethink game features, and Itch blocked adult-oriented games on its store after being unable to find a satisfactory age verification solution in time. Jeremy Peel spoke to a range of people affected by the OSA for an in-depth feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Over the summer, a pressure group campaign resulted in a crackdown on adult games on Steam and Itch. It all started with a sexually explicit visual novel called No Mercy: UK technology secretary Peter Kyle had criticised the title in April, and it was subsequently removed from sale in the UK by Zerat Games. But the Australian group Collective Shout took the campaign to the next level by contacting payment processing companies, which put pressure on Steam and Itch to remove sex-related titles. Jeremy Peel gave a rundown of exactly what happened in this feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Activision studio Raven Software ratified its first union contract with Microsoft in August. The new agreement guarantees a 10% wage increase over the next two years, as well as seeking to eliminate crunch and provide workers with seven days' notice for any additional mandatory overtime. A few months later, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance became the first recognised workers union in the UK games industry. On August 22, Team Cherry announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong would release on September 4, prompting other games companies to rapidly shift their release dates in response. Such was its popularity that the game's release crashed global stores right across Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam's digital platforms, and it would go on to sell over 7 million copies in three months. In September, the Game Developers Conference announced a rebrand as GDC Festival of Gaming, leaving some to speculate that the conference would now be welcoming consumers as well as industry attendees. However, in an interview the following month, the organisers indicated that this wouldn't be the case, saying: "The festival part of the GDC Festival is that we're broadening out what the conference is and does, but not into a consumer space." Reaction to the rebrand was mixed. In late September, it was announced that EA would be purchased by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The total deal is worth $55 billion, but $20 billion of that total is being borrowed by the consortium. The deal will almost certainly require regulatory approval, and is expected to close during Q1 FY27, if given the go ahead. Mat Piscatella of Circana was one of several industry commentators who expressed worries about the EA deal: "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said. A disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October took thousands of web-based businesses – about a third of the internet – offline, with parts of the US being hardest hit. In the games industry, web-based services affected included Fortnite, Roblox, and PlayStation Network. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. At the start of November, Take Two Interactive delayed GTA 6 for a second time, moving next year's biggest release back six months to November 19, 2026. The delay caused a wide range of reactions in the games industry. "For many of our clients, it opens up a valuable window," said Damien Sarrazin, CEO & founder of HomeRun PR, "one that was previously seen as completely dominated by Rockstar's marketing and media gravity." Valve announced three new devices in November: the Steam Frame VR headset, a new Steam controller, and the console-like Steam Machine. Of the three, the Steam Machine – set to be released in early 2026 with "pretty competitive" pricing to equivalent PCs – caused the most stir. Rob Fahey suggested it could be an "industry turning point." On November 21, Ubisoft announced the completion of Tencent's €1.16 billion investment in Vantage Studios, the division in charge of the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Prior to the announcement, Ubisoft had postponed the release of its H1 2025-26 financial results and suspended share trading, prompting widespread speculation. At the start of December, news emerged that Netflix was buying entertainment giant Warner Bros. in a deal valued at around $82.7 billion. Soon after, Paramount Skydance launched a rival hostile takeover attempt, which Warner's board advised shareholders to reject. Netflix said that it did not "attribute any value" to Warner Bros' games business as part of its proposed acquisition of the entertainment giant, leaving many to wonder what the deal will mean for Warner Bros. Games. Activision announced it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, following significant underperformance of the latest release in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This year, the franchise faced fierce competition from the likes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. Rhys Elliott at Alinea Analytics said: "For years, Call of Duty was virtually immune to competition, but now the player base is splitting and annoyed, the franchise is creatively drained, and rivals have been more methodical and focused." Finally, comments made about generative AI by Larian Studios head Swen Vincke in a Bloomberg interview sparked an explosion of posts on social media in December. This prompted Vincke to issue a hurried clarification, saying that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is "not replacing concept artists with AI," and that it is only using AI at the "very early ideation stages" as a "rough outline for composition." The episode came on top of several outbursts of AI outrage throughout 2025, including a row over the use of AI speech in Embark Games' Arc Raiders, which prompted Epic Games' Tim Sweeney to wade into the debate in defence of the technology.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The year in review with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll The year that changed everything is almost over. In this special year-end episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll break down the founders, funds, and companies that defined 2025—and make bold predictions for what’s coming in 2026. From Dario Amodei earning “Founder of the Year” to why SpaceX will IPO before OpenAI, from the talent wars that “threw all conventions out the window” to why unemployment data could trigger a massive tech lash—this is the definitive look at where we’ve been and where we’re going. Spoiler: If you’re a B2B company that didn’t reaccelerate with AI in 2025, you got an F minus. And if unemployment ticks up even 2-3 points next year for any reason? “Society will be terrified of AI.” The unanimous choice wasn’t about predictions of mass unemployment (which the panel largely dismissed). It was about execution. Claude 3.5 and 4 changed everything—enabling vibe coding, powering Cursor, making Lovable and Replit actually work. “Without this, we have no vibe coding,” Jason said. “Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” But it’s not just product. Rory highlighted Anthropic’s business execution: “Growth rate faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… he’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” Honorable mentions went to Gwyn Shotwell at SpaceX (“navigating geopolitically challenging times with Elon’s brand this year… exceptional”), Alex Wang at Scale AI (“the best of the pseudo-hire playbook—moment in time, playing your cards right”), and Vlad at Robinhood (“Nine products doing over $100 million in revenue. JFC.”). Index wins on pure execution: Wiz (announced this year, $32B), Figma (seed), and Revolut ($75B). “Competent execution across multiple different exits,” Rory said. “Exits are the coin of the realm.” But Jason gave his vote to Neo on aesthetics and hustle: first money into Cursor and Cognition. “24 months ago, he seemed to be having weird arguments with Gary Tan on Twitter. Now he’s literally hustling his way into cursor, hanging out at MIT, giving programming tests himself.” And the wildcard? Google—owning ~10% of SpaceX, ~14% of Anthropic, and the majority of Waymo. “Those three with double-digit ownerships, even if done in a circular way… corporate investor of the year.” Meta paying $100M for individual researchers. The $14B deal to acquire a company’s team while letting investors keep the husk. Nat and Daniel getting their venture fund acquired too. “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months,” Rory said. In retrospect, the logic makes sense: “If you’re spending $73 billion on capex, spending $5 billion to make sure the people using the capex know what they’re doing probably makes sense.” The other massive surprise? There’s no ceiling on venture outcomes anymore. Lovable going from $2B to $8B valuation in weeks. Anthropic at $100M being “the deal of the century from a risk-reward outcome.” “That there is no ceiling on venture… changes all the math and calculations.” “Every founder, every VC—our job was to ride this torrent of AI,” Jason explained. “If you’re not an LLM, your job this year was to ride the greatest wave of our lifetimes.” Databricks did exactly that. In 2021, Databricks was presenting about managing cloud compute and data—nothing about AI. Now they’re at $5B revenue growing 55%, accelerating, while Snowflake’s AI revenue remains small. “If we had to have canon of the year for who rode the AI wave and utterly changed the trajectory of the company, it would be Databricks.” Other breakouts: Eleven Labs (scaled to $400M ARR, standing off OpenAI competition—”$30 in 10 minutes versus $2,000 in two weeks”), and Open Evidence (capturing 500K of the 1M US doctors in one year by perfectly targeting medical search). Jason’s order: SpaceX goes first (probably summer), Canva second (“the AI story is not perfect, but the numbers are there—do it now before looking obsolete”), Databricks in the back half (“it’s just the Series M”), Anthropic at year-end (“the simpler way to solve their capital needs”). OpenAI? Probably mid-2027. “It’s burning too much.” The challenge: taking a company public at $1 trillion is an unsolved banking problem. “What do you do with $950 billion in stock when many owners have been in for 10-15 years? Could be tricky.” The top B2B public stocks (Palantir, Cloudflare, Monday, Shopify, CrowdStrike, Snowflake) have all figured out their AI tailwinds. Jason’s betting at least three stay in the top six next year: “I’m not a hedge fund guy, but the trends aren’t going to change much.” But the contrarian bet? Salesforce. Trading at all-time low revenue multiples (5-5.5x), but when Agent Force actually works at scale: “Every single Salesforce customer is going to want that product. Would you like this agent to automatically go after all the customers your team didn’t follow up with? Sign me the f— up.” The warning: Adobe is “the worst offender” for claiming $5B of “AI-influenced revenue” without net new bookings. “If you’re going to hide in your tower and say ‘we grew 8% but half was AI-influenced’—that’s table stakes.” “2025’s biggest failure was the co-pilot,” Jason said. “We’re not going to put it in our base product. We’re not going to make the core product better. But we’re not going to provide so much value that you want to pay for it. That was the cynical whiteboard of January 2025 that failed up and down the B2B board.” The counterexample? Notion. If they really hit 50% growth at $600M, the only explanation is customers paying $20/month instead of $10 for their AI offering. “I can’t use Notion without AI as a 10-year customer. It’s worth the 2x.” Very few B2B companies have earned that premium. Rory’s pick: Buy Google, short Nvidia. “If the capex cycle continues and we’re all still spending, Nvidia does fine. But unless they need continued acceleration… Google has upside if the capex tide goes out.” Jason’s counter: “You’re a fool to invest against Nvidia for 2026. There’s not enough time for competing GPUs and TPUs to get into data centers that don’t exist. 2027? I don’t know. But 2026—the bet’s still on.” Amazon is the underperformer candidate—only up 2% this year, and “there’s just not enough time” for their AI strategy to materialize. Here’s the prediction that should worry everyone: if unemployment ticks up 2-3 points for any reason—tariffs, business cycle, bank events—AI will take the blame. “All the AI executives talk about there will be an impact on unemployment,” Rory noted. “Politics doesn’t work by looking at BLS data by subgroup. All they’ll know is: unemployment’s ticked up, and those guys building AI are admitting the crime. They’re like, ‘We did it. We put you all out of a job.'” Jason agreed: “When there’s hard numbers at the top of the New York Times… it will become every dinner table conversation. Society will be terrified of AI.” The dark humor? “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “What was the biggest surprise of 2025? The three days when Windsurf was being bought by Cognition and I interviewed Varun the day before—are they being bought? Are they not? OpenAI was buying them and then they’re not—that was a bizarre moment.” “Nvidia investing $100 billion into OpenAI and the start of the circular deals… all of us giving up on caring about things like circular deals. We’ve all stopped caring. If it marks up my fund, great. It’s just the way it is now.” “Which companies go public in 2026? SpaceX, Canva, Databricks, Anthropic—four IPOs backloaded next year. OpenAI probably should have gone first, but it’s burning too much.” “The product of the year is Claude 3.5 or 3.7. Without this, we have no vibe coding. Without this, we have no Lovable, no Replit, no Cursor that really works. Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” “What agents can do—we just started. Outside of parts of coding, we just started. We haven’t missed the boat as investors. We haven’t missed the boat.” “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months. Blew me away.” “Exits are the coin of the realm. The only fair way to measure things is: did you end up owning a lot and having big ownership in big exits?” “If the AI kind of lift starts to recede, they’ll all come down because they’re way over their long-term valuation. Pennies in front of steam wheels. Someone’s going to look up and say, ‘Oh my god, 70x… I should panic.'” This post is part of the ongoing 20VC x SaaStr collaboration.

New information has come to light about the canceled reboot of the classic spy game Perfect Dark, stating that the game had met significant development milestones, with entire chapters of motion capture recorded before Microsoft shelved the project. Joanna Dark’s voice was lent by Alix Wilton-Regan, who recently spoke in an interview with TheGamer and revealed that Perfect Dark Reboot’s development had been in the works for many years. Early recording sessions began in 2023, steadily increased in 2024, and continued until the game’s cancellation. Joanna Dark’s voice actor said, “To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I’d done entire chapters of this universe.” She even mentioned that the game had completed several key developmental milestones, which Microsoft was pleased about. The Initiative Studio was developing Perfect Dark’s reboot in partnership with Crystal Dynamics under Xbox’s endorsement. The project was supposed to fill a void left by the absence of action-espionage games in recent years. However, that has changed with the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and the announcement of 007: First Light. The cancellation came as quite a shock to everyone. Wilton-Regan learned about it online, like the rest of the world, with no prior notice from Microsoft. She added: I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed. I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded. It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded. This decision came out of the blue, leading to thousands of layoffs in the Xbox Games division and the closure of many Xbox-partner studios, such as The Initiative. However, leadership from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics scoured for two months to secure new funding in a last-ditch effort. Interestingly, Wilton-Regan knew about these conversations and revealed that hope hadn’t died out for the Perfect Dark reboot, up until the last moment. She said: I couldn’t say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn’t gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping.

Title: If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall Street The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn’t a traditional dividend ETF – AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD’s price movements. AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund’s 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums. The fund’s income depends entirely on AMD’s volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD’s 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY’s triple-digit distribution rate. AMDY’s strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD’s appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield. More concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY’s distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY’s net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation. AMD’s business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY’s strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue. However, AMD’s valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY’s distributions come entirely from options premiums. AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week’s distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD’s price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund’s 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline. Investors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels. Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work
URL: https://pleated-jeans.com/2025/12/22/people-share-the-most-disappointing-gifts-they-ever-received-at-work/
Time Published: 2025-12-22T14:04:09Z
Full Content:
Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it – these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My mom’s boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but it’s still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, “I got a rock.” Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasn’t going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says you’re family, just remember that it’s the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasn’t so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidays…..I’m Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word “Hope”. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partner’s company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said “happy appreciation week”. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, “she did not want me missing the company bonus”. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldn’t wear denim at work so the only time we’d be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when we’d have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we can’t wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places don’t give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Could’ve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we can’t wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t.

Investing Nvidia is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. Sending You to Google News in 3 © lupmotion / Shutterstock.com After gaining $6.85 on Friday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up another $3.25 in premarket. The tech giant is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating, thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. “We are OW as the company has long-term sustainable growth led by a large lead in GPUs for AI in DC, with further Edge opportunities (autos, robots, etc.) and a competitive moat around a large portion of the market,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Technically, after finding triple bottom support dating back to September, NVDA is now challenging resistance at its 50-day moving average. However, if it can break above that, which could happen today, we’d like to see NVDA retest $200 next. Plus, despite AI bubble fears, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030, as noted by Grand View Research. After gaining $12.37 on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is up another $4 in premarket. Technically, after finding strong support dating back to late November, AMD is just starting to pivot higher. From its last traded price of $213.43, we’d like to see it challenge its 50-day moving average at around $239.74. AMD is also just starting to pivot from oversold RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Also fueling upside is optimism following AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su’s meeting with China’s Commerce Minister, where the two spoke about strengthening cooperation. On her second day of a China trip, Su exchanged views with MIIT head Li Lecheng on “strengthening cooperation in the digital economy and artificial intelligence sectors, according to a statement issued by MIIT, as reported by the South China Morning Post. After an explosive few days on earnings and guidance, Micron (NASDAQ: MU) is up another $10.45 a share in premarket. While Micron is becoming overbought after breaking above triple top resistance, analysts are arguing for more upside. Analysts at Rosenblatt, for example, have a $500 price target on MU with a buy rating, citing accelerating demand for memory and storage thanks to AI. As we noted the other day, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Fueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook.

Title: Monthly Pay ETFs Go Mainstream And Retirees LOVE Them

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St I opened the conversation by admitting something most investors eventually confront. There are products in the market that sound intriguing, but you are not entirely sure how they work. Monthly pay ETFs fall squarely into that category for many people. Lee stepped in to explain why they have quietly become one of the most useful income tools available today. Lee started with the basics. Exchange traded funds trade intraday, unlike traditional open-end mutual funds that settle at the end of the day. What surprised many income investors over the past decade is that while most ETFs originally paid dividends quarterly, a growing group now pays monthly. For retirees, boomers, and older Gen X investors, that distinction matters far more than it sounds. Lee pointed to JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) Equity Premium Income ETF, symbol JEPI, as the most widely recognized example. With roughly $30 billion in assets, JEPI pays a monthly yield north of 8%. While it does experience some volatility during broader market drawdowns, Lee noted that income-focused investors continue to support it because consistent cash flow is the primary objective. We also discussed more specialized options. One that stood out was the Gabelli Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (NYSE: GGN). Managed by Mario Gabelli’s firm, it holds a mix of gold and energy stocks, effectively pairing two sectors that often perform well during inflationary or volatile environments. GGN pays a monthly dividend above 8%, making it attractive for investors who want sector exposure alongside income. Another higher-yield option Lee mentioned was BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II (NYSE: BSTZ), a technology-oriented income fund paying monthly distributions exceeding 11%. These types of funds are not designed for ultra-conservative investors, but for those willing to accept some volatility, the income potential can be compelling. Lee emphasized that monthly pay ETFs are particularly well suited for boomers and Gen X investors nearing retirement. They are not replacements for Treasury bonds or insured products, but they serve as powerful income complements. Even investors who do not currently need the income can reinvest monthly dividends, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. When prices dip, reinvested dividends buy more shares, enhancing long-term income potential. We agreed that monthly pay ETFs are one of the most practical innovations in income investing over the past decade. They combine liquidity, yield, and flexibility in a way traditional dividend stocks and mutual funds often cannot. Whether used to fund living expenses or to compound income over time, they give investors another way to turn portfolios into cash-flow engines. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there’s something out that I don’t even know how it works, but you do. It’s monthly pay ETFs. Tell me about them, I’m not familiar. [00:00:13] Lee Jackson: Well, everybody is probably pretty familiar with the exchange traded fund now and the way they vary from the old opened end mutual fund, exchange traded funds, trade on the major exchanges and they’re, you can buy and sell ’em anytime during the day when you want, at any price. [00:00:31] It doesn’t matter. Whereas when you wanna sell your Vanguard, open-end mutual fund, you may have to call Vanguard and sell and you’ll get the end of the day price. Yeah. But, one of the things that we found out and I was intrigued by, ’cause I’ve written about dividend and dividend paying stocks at, 24/7 for almost 15 years, is that most of these ETFs paid like mutual funds. [00:00:55] They pay quarterly. But in the last 10, 8, 10 years, they started to have ETFs that paid monthly. And think of that if you’re a boomer, an older, gen X person getting, what Better to supplement your passive income. And remember, passive income is income. that the IRS views, it’s anything from your job. [00:01:19] So if you have stocks or bonds or real estate or things like that that generate income, that’s passive income. Well, some of the really good ones that we like, and one of the biggest ones is it’s got $30 billion in it, is run by JP Morgan and it’s the, symbol on it is JEPI. It pays about an eight 15% yield monthly. [00:01:43] Wow. Monthly and you know it ha has it gone up and down a little bit? Did it go down a little bit, when we had the draw down in late October and November? Yeah, but then it came right back. ’cause who doesn’t want an eight 40 or eight 50, whatever it is, dividend monthly with, I mean, is there risk? Sure, because it is, it’s not a treasury bond yielding 3.8%. [00:02:07] It’s yielding 8.3% or whatever it is. That’s a good one. Another one we like and this is especially interesting if it’s people that are wanting a sector play, is, the Gabelli Gamco trust, symbol. GGN. Yeah. All, it holds is gold stocks. And energy stocks, so that’s almost your perfect Paris trade in one. [00:02:33] You’ve got the red hot gold stocks, which Goldman Sachs thinks exceed 4,900 next year, and then it has all of the quality energy stocks, but it pays monthly. The dividend on GGN is in the eight plus percent range. It’s run by Mario Gabelli’s company. He’s been on wall team for 50 years. So that’s a good shot to take. [00:02:57] Another good one that we like it’s, the symbol is BSTZ and it’s sort of a income related technology play, but the, again, the dividends monthly, it’s about 11.2%. And again, these aren’t for people that are very, very, very conservative. All the JP Morgan one you could go with, it’s, that’s pretty good. Very conservative, really all, and they all use big, they write covered calls on their positions. The stocks go up, they get called away, they replace it with another stock or buy the stock again. But I think for boomers, gen X people that are steering towards retirement, these are the perfect adjuncts to social security, pension funds, IRA distributions, anything like that. every bill that you have to pay for the most part comes monthly. Your car payment or your mortgage payment doesn’t come every quarter, comes every single month. [00:04:01] And what better way to augment income with passive income? And these are good, good ideas and we constantly write about this. So if you keep checking on, 24/7 Wall Street, you’ll see our ideas, I mean, we have so many good writers covering this now, [00:04:18] we probably have 10 guys and gals that are covering the exchange traded fund, income stocks. So they’re a good way to generate money. And, again, if you don’t need the income, if you don’t need the income, you can reinvest your dividends. [00:04:33] Just go to your broker and say, I wanna reinvest these every month. So if, it goes up a little bit and you’re reinvesting, you won’t buy as much. But if it does go down, like the draw down we had in October and November, you’ll buy more shares. So either way, just remember it. It’s like the dream investment for boomers, the monthly pay etf.

Title: AMZU Let’s You Bet 200% On Amazon But That Doesn’t Mean You Should

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Direxion Daily AMZN Bull 2X Shares (NYSEARCA:AMZU) offers 200% daily exposure to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but its mechanics reveal why it’s designed for short-term traders, not income investors. Understanding how AMZU generates distributions and its structural risks is critical before investing. AMZU doesn’t generate income through traditional dividends. It uses derivatives, swaps, and daily rebalancing to achieve 200% exposure to Amazon’s daily price movements. When Amazon pays a dividend, AMZU receives the distribution amplified through leverage, but at significant cost. The ETF paid a $1.20 special dividend in December 2025, but this must be evaluated against substantial NAV erosion from volatility decay. The fund holds only 13.57% in direct Amazon equity, with the remainder in derivatives for daily 2x leverage. This structure resets leverage daily, creating compounding drag that destroys long-term returns even when the underlying stock performs well. While Amazon declined 1.64% over the past year, AMZU lost 23.15% – nearly 20 percentage points beyond what 2x leverage predicts. The S&P 500 gained 12.63% and the Nasdaq-100 surged 20.70% over the same period. Year-to-date through December 2025, Amazon gained 3.63%, which should theoretically produce a 7.26% return for AMZU. Instead, the fund lost 13.99% – a 21-percentage-point shortfall from volatility decay. This occurs because daily resets lock in losses during choppy markets. When Amazon drops 2% one day and rises 2% the next, AMZU doesn’t return to breakeven due to compounding effects. Recent volatility illustrates the problem. In December 2025, Amazon experienced multiple 3-4% daily swings, with intraday ranges exceeding $7. On December 17, the stock dropped 4.4%. These moves amplify decay as AMZU rebalances derivatives at the worst times. While AMZU’s $1.20 special dividend might seem attractive, total return matters more. High yield means nothing if the ETF price collapses. Since inception in September 2022, AMZU has consistently underperformed its theoretical 2x target during volatile periods. Amazon’s fundamentals remain strong—Q3 2025 revenue of $180.2 billion and net income of $21.2 billion both beat estimates. AWS sales grew 20%, and the company maintains 24.3% return on equity with a healthy balance sheet. However, these positives don’t translate to AMZU performance due to daily resets. The ETF’s $321.5 million in assets and limited three-year track record provide insufficient data for long-term distribution patterns. The structure guarantees volatility will erode returns over extended periods, making dividend sustainability irrelevant when capital losses exceed income received. For leveraged technology exposure without single-stock concentration risk, ProShares UltraPro QQQ (NASDAQ:TQQQ) offers better diversification. TQQQ provides 3x daily exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index, including Amazon alongside 99 other leading technology companies. TQQQ generates income from dividends across the entire Nasdaq-100.

Title: AI layoffs in 2025: Over 55,000 US job cuts are linked to arrival of artificial intelligence – here's list of companies

Layoffs have been a major concern in the job market in 2025 as several major companies announced significant job cuts amid the growing use of artificial intelligence. This year alone, AI has led to almost 55,000 layoffs in the US, according to a report by CNBC citing consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2025, total job cuts reached 1.17 million, the highest since 2020, when 2.2 million layoffs were announced. US employers reported 153,000 job cuts in October, and over 71,000 cuts occurred in November, with AI responsible for more than 6,000 of these layoffs, the report said. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report in November, noting that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labour market and save up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. However, some experts disagree that AI is the primary cause of the significant job cuts. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC that it could be just an excuse. Stephany mentioned that many companies which did well during the pandemic “significantly overhired," and the recent layoffs could simply be a “market clearance”. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long-term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,’” he added. Check out the companies that announced AI-linked layoffs — The tech giant announced its largest-ever layoffs, cutting 14,000 corporate jobs to focus on its “biggest bets”, including AI. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs by 2025, with its latest announcement in July signalling 9,000 roles to be eliminated. In a memo to employees, CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that the company must' reimagine” its mission for a new era' and highlighted the importance of AI for the company's future, the report noted. “What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve,” Nadella was quoted as saying. In September, CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had laid off 4,000 customer support staff, utilising AI, the report said. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Benioff said in an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast. Benioff stated over the summer that AI was already managing up to 50% of the company's work. CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots had replaced the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. Unlike other companies, which cited AI as a reason for job cuts, Krishna, however, noted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. The company announced a 1% reduction in its global workforce in November, which is expected to affect approximately 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike announced in May that it is laying off 5% of its staff, amounting to 500 employees, citing AI as the direct reason for the cuts. “AI has always been foundational to how we operate,” the report quoted co-founder and CEO George Kurtz's memo. “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” Human resources platform Workday in February announced it would cut 8.5% of its workforce, roughly 1,750 jobs, as the company increases its investment in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach stated that the layoffs were necessary to focus on AI investments and to free up resources.

Title: Quite a few of the AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were actually ex-employees

20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were ex-employees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google is re-hiring a number of ex-employees to help boost its AI strategy, a new CNBC report states, claiming one in five AI software engineer hires were so-called 'boomerang' employees. Not only is this figure up from previous years, but Google also claims to be hiring more workers from rival companies (like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple) than ever before. "We're energized by our momentum, compute and talent – engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products," a company spokesperson shared. Data published by ADP Research confirms 'boomerang' hiring, where companies regain former assets (including from periods spent at rival companies), is on the rise, and has been since 2022. This trend is amplified within the information sector, while other sections like leisure and hospitality, health and construction see fewer returning employees. Google also has a large pool of alumni to pick from after cutting around 12,000 workers in early 2023, plus hundreds more in smaller rounds of layoffs. When ChatGPT hit the ground running in November 2022, rival companies like Google were left stunned, but recent years have seen Google in particular step up to the mark. The company recently launched Gemini 3, and with it "a new era of intelligence." The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users, but it still lags behind OpenAI's 800 million weekly ChatGPT users.

Company shares are up 62% this year to date. On the flip side, Google isn't the only company poaching AI talent. Apple recently announced that 16-year Google veteran Amar Subramanya would be joining Apple as VP of AI following John Giannandrea's departure.

Title: I was laid off by Oracle 2 years ago and still can't find a job. I've blown through my savings and now sell antiques to stay afloat.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This "as-told-to" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go. I didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024. I was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape. More than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed. When I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position. I earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle. In addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary. When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: In my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday. When I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. After graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara. I took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll. At the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral. My pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile. My job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office. I've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on "Jeopardy!" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role. My family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a "just-in-case" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left. A few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business. I would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan. My business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods. It's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging. I'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story. Before I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection. If I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations. Jump to
