December 13, 2025 23:19 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its first dedicated mission for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) – a pivotal marker of Electron’s global importance for regular, reliable, and dedicated access to space. The “RAISE And Shine” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 14, 2025 at 03:09 UTC / 16:09 NZDT to successfully deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft: a demonstration of eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. The mission was the first of two dedicated missions for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. Rocket Lab’s successful launch for JAXA reflects the growing integration of commercial companies into national space programs both domestically and internationally. As the established small launch leader in the United States, Electron is also the preferred choice for reliable small launch globally, with its second upcoming mission for JAXA scheduled for launch in Q1 2026. A dedicated Electron launch for the European Space Agency (ESA) is also planned for launch in the new year, further highlighting Electron’s international demand. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “This dedicated mission delivered precision and reliability for one of the world’s most respected space agencies, and we couldn’t be prouder of supporting JAXA with the dedicated access to space needed to support the growth of Japan’s aerospace economy. We’re proud to continue delivering the responsiveness and performance that Japan’s satellite operators have come to rely on.” “RAISE And Shine” was Rocket Lab’s 19th launch of the year: an extension of the Company’s new Electron annual launch record established just last month with two back-to-back missions launched in 48 hours. Rocket Lab’s next launch of 2025 is scheduled to take place from Launch Complex 2 this month and will be announced in the coming days. “RAISE And Shine” launch images: Flight 77 | RAISE & Shine | Flickr “RAISE And Shine” launch webcast: Rocket Lab - 'RAISE and Shine' Launch for JAXA - YouTube Rocket Lab Media Contact Murielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabAbout Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Title: Bitcoin To Retest $85,000 Mark In Coming Days – Here’s Why

Amid a steady price rebound in the Bitcoin (BTC) market, popular market analyst with the X username KillaXBT is predicting another significant correction in the forthcoming days. In an X post on December 12, KillaXBT outlines a cautious market insight that suggests Bitcoin is headed for a price pullback. According to the renowned analyst, the premier cryptocurrency has consistently recorded an 8% price decline after the 14th day of the last five months. KillaXBT describes this observation as the 14th Pivot, which now holds important implications for Bitcoin in the short term. Since hitting a price bottom of $80,000 in late November, BTC has formed an ascending channel, recording a steady series of higher lows and higher highs. However, KillaXBT’s projection is expected to break this channel, potentially halting the nascent uptrend. Going by the recurring price pattern, the analyst states Bitcoin investors should anticipate a minimum 5% price decline after the 14th of December, hinting at a potential retest of the 85,000-$86,000 price zone. Given the asset’s broader bullish market structure, such a move may represent nothing more than a short-term pullback. However, the prolonged correction seen earlier in Q4 has already set a precedent, leaving room for another phase of deeper downside should momentum weaken. In another X post, KillaXBT shares more bearish projections of the Bitcoin market. This time, the seasoned analyst predicts the crypto market leader will hit a price bottom of $48,905 despite recent price gains. KillaXBT’s bottom target represents Bitcoin’s price as of the approval of the BlackRock IBIT ETF, alongside 11 other Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024. This projection is likely due to the common rationale that the present bullish run has been heavily supported by institutional inflows. Notably, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been central to these institutional inflows, boasting total net assets of $119.18 billion. The BlackRock IBIT holds over half of this traction as the undisputed market leader with $71.03 billion in net assets and $62.68 billion in cumulative net inflows. If Bitcoin were to return to its pre-ETF approval price levels, it would imply an estimated 46% decline from current market prices. Such a move would likely signal a sharp reversal in institutional positioning, suggesting that sustained ETF outflows, rather than retail capitulation, could emerge as the primary catalyst for a renewed crypto winter. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $90,348, reflecting a 2.18% decline. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: AI has taken over Wall Street. Should it take over your portfolio too?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. The extraordinary rally in US technology stocks over the past few years, especially those linked to artificial intelligence, has left investors wondering whether they are witnessing the formation of another classic market bubble. For Indian investors, the concern is sharper because most international exposure from the country is concentrated overwhelmingly in US equities, particularly Nasdaq-heavy funds. While exposure to the world’s largest economy remains important, the current environment suggests that investors need to think more broadly about global diversification, rather than anchoring portfolios to a single market and a single theme. The rise of mega-capsThe US market rally has increasingly become a narrow one, powered by a small group of AI-linked mega-caps. While mega-caps are defined as the companies with over $200 billion market capitalization, 10 US stocks currently hold a market cap of over $1 trillion each. These include names like Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., etc. Over the last three to four years, these companies have surged on the back of aggressive spending on data centres, chips, and computing infrastructure. The scale of this concentration is unprecedented. “AI-related firms have contributed almost 80% of US equity gains in 2025, with just the five biggest AI mega-caps making up around 30% of the S&P 500 and 20% of the MSCI World Index, the highest concentration in nearly 50 years," said Ankur Punj, managing director and business head at wealth management platform Equirus Wealth. Also Read | Missed Tesla and Netflix? Here’s how Indians are now investing abroad The US technology sector now accounts for around 35% of total US market capitalization, and the 10 largest US companies comprise more than 20% of global equity value. Such dominance is extraordinary by historical standards and raises the risk that returns are being driven by an increasingly narrow part of the market. Punj added that the S&P 500 is currently trading around 23x forward earnings, placing it in one of the most stretched valuation phases relative to other global markets since the dot-com boom. AI-related capital expenditure is expected to touch $390 billion in 2025, heavily concentrated in a handful of companies and contributing to what Punj described as a “circular AI economy". Signs of a bubbleYet, according to most analysts and reports, despite these stretched valuations and the lopsided market structure, the US tech sector is not in an outright bubble, at least not in the classic sense. Some segments of the US market are indeed expensive relative to their own history, pointed out Raunak Onkar, head of research and fund manager at PPFAS Mutual Fund. “Some businesses have seen a sharp rise in valuations simply because their short-term numbers have surged with AI demand, but not all of these companies have cash flows strong enough to justify those valuations." But he added that it would be inaccurate to call the entire US tech landscape a bubble, because certain companies continue to generate strong cash flows that fund their growth. View Full Image Valuation opportunities outside the US look more balanced. A recent Deutsche Bank report makes the same point: The rise in AI-driven valuations has been accompanied by real earnings growth and robust profitability, unlike earlier bubbles that were fuelled by unproven business models and unrealistic assumptions. Dangerous dependenceOnkar cautioned that chasing fads simply because stock prices are rising is not advisable. And for Indian investors, the implications of the US rally are different from those for American investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized that the real problem for Indian investors is not exposure to the US per se, but excessive dependence on a single geography and theme. A narrow market rally, stretched valuations, and currency movements create asymmetrical risks. Punj pointed out that Indian investors face a double-layered risk during a US correction. “A US pullback driven by an AI correction could see stocks fall. If stocks fall, capital may move out of the US, causing the dollar to weaken against the rupee, hitting Indian investors both ways." Onkar added that international investing should follow a diversified approach rather than revolve around the US alone. For most Indian investors building global exposure, the weakness lies in the absence of meaningful allocation to the rest of the world. Beyond the USThe US comprises half of the global market capitalization. Therefore, any diversified global portfolio, noted Onkar of PPFAS Mutual Fund, cannot and should not exclude the US entirely. “If one has to build global exposure, investors will need to accept US markets as being part of that diversified portfolio. Also, looking at it purely from a US and non-US perspective might disadvantage investors as they won't be able to participate in sectors that are leading with growth," he explained. Many innovative companies across sectors are listed in the US but earn cash flows from across the world. Also Read | Investing abroad: Here are the pros and cons of using old and new routes Nevertheless, valuation opportunities outside the US look more balanced. Punj highlighted Europe and Japan as attractive regions. Europe offers broad-based exposure through cyclical sectors, industrials, and stable dividend-paying companies that have significantly lagged US valuations. Japan, despite its strong run, continues to benefit from corporate governance reforms, improving shareholder returns, and valuations that remain appealing in many long-neglected sectors. Overcoming the fears of technical recession until a few months ago, meaning two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, Japan’s equity market remains anchored by sustained reform momentum. Recent reports from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs indicate that Japanese equities are undergoing a structural re-rating, driven by rising dividends, record buybacks, and stronger board independence, marking a significant departure from decades of economic stagnation. Among emerging markets, Brazil appears particularly compelling. Punj noted that Brazil trades at low-teen price-to-earnings multiples while benefiting from commodity demand, structural reforms, and higher foreign participation. Taiwan and Korea also offer exposure to the global semiconductor supply chain, but remain more volatile and sensitive to US tech sentiment. Punj suggests that Indian investors diversify across developed markets like Europe and Japan, with modest exposure to emerging markets. “Retail investors should restrict international allocation to 20% of the overall portfolio, and as far as allocation outside the US is concerned, currently should focus on Europe/Japan, 80%, and some allocation to emerging markets like Brazil, 20%," he said. Diversification through mutual fundsInterestingly, mutual fund data suggests that Indian investors have already started rebalancing to other geographies. Several international funds outside the US have seen significant AUM growth. The Invesco India-Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund grew from ₹25 crore in December 2024 to ₹170 crore in October 2025, a jump of 580%. The Axis Greater China Equity FoF saw its AUM rise 488% to ₹1,501 crore over the same period. These trends show growing willingness among investors to explore opportunities beyond US-centric products. Onkar stressed that even outside the US, there are pockets of expensive and reasonably priced businesses. “Valuation opportunities exist everywhere, even in markets that appear overvalued in aggregates," he said. So, instead of betting on single countries, he recommended multi-geography ETFs, which offer instant diversification without requiring investors to track individual stock stories across continents. Saurabh Mittal, CFA and founding director at wealth manager Circle Wealth Advisors, said most client portfolios maintain 10% to 15% international exposure. But after the sharp US rally in recent months, the weight of US funds has naturally risen. “What we are doing is just rebalancing those allocations and bringing them back to desired levels," he explained. Money is also being shifted from US-specific funds to broader global indices like the MSCI World Index. “But even in the MSCI World Index, US stocks are approximately 75%. So you are not immune to what happens in the US," he said. The MSCI World Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 23 Developed Markets (DM) countries. Mutual funds or ETFs?Most experts believe India-domiciled international mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain the cleanest and relatively safer way for Indian investors to build global exposure. Punj highlighted their advantages: better risk control, simpler taxation, transparent structure, and none of the complexities involved in owning stocks directly abroad. Onkar added that stock-picking in international markets requires deep research and monitoring, which remains difficult for most retail investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized the importance of a staggered approach to investments, as predicting corrections or bubbles is impossible. A long-term horizon and systematic investing, he said, is the most reliable path. While that may be true given that domestic domiciled ETFs are trading at a premium, now may not be the time to invest through them. Rushabh Desai, founder of mutual fund distributor Rupee With Rushabh Investment Services, said valuations in US equity markets, especially tech, have become expensive, and due to Securities and Exchange Board of India’s restrictions on overseas mutual fund inflows, many ETFs are trading at unusually high premiums. In his view, domestic markets currently offer better risk-adjusted opportunities. “This is the right time to focus on home rather than abroad as the returns in the Indian equity markets have been subdued and with reasonable valuations in many pockets," he added. Investing via mutual funds, either through active or index funds, said Desai, is always better from a risk, return and liquidity point of view for retail investors. But if you are looking to invest abroad, you could consider outbound retail funds and ETFs that apps like Vested Finance and IndMoney have begun to offer.

As Onkar noted, investing isn’t thrill-seeking but goal-driven. With the US so dominant and capable of making global markets “catch a cold" when it sneezes, a broader, more balanced global diversification via the mutual fund route, where experts invest your money after deep research, remains the safer long-term path.

Onkar added that stock-picking in international markets requires deep research and monitoring, which remains difficult for most retail investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized the importance of a staggered approach to investments, as predicting corrections or bubbles is impossible. A long-term horizon and systematic investing, he said, is the most reliable path. While that may be true given that domestic domiciled ETFs are trading at a premium, now may not be the time to invest through them. Rushabh Desai, founder of mutual fund distributor Rupee With Rushabh Investment Services, said valuations in US equity markets, especially tech, have become expensive, and due to Securities and Exchange Board of India’s restrictions on overseas mutual fund inflows, many ETFs are trading at unusually high premiums. In his view, domestic markets currently offer better risk-adjusted opportunities. “This is the right time to focus on home rather than abroad as the returns in the Indian equity markets have been subdued and with reasonable valuations in many pockets," he added. Investing via mutual funds, either through active or index funds, said Desai, is always better from a risk, return and liquidity point of view for retail investors. But if you are looking to invest abroad, you could consider outbound retail funds and ETFs that apps like Vested Finance and IndMoney have begun to offer.

As Onkar noted, investing isn’t thrill-seeking but goal-driven. With the US so dominant and capable of making global markets “catch a cold" when it sneezes, a broader, more balanced global diversification via the mutual fund route, where experts invest your money after deep research, remains the safer long-term path. Onkar cautioned that chasing fads simply because stock prices are rising is not advisable. And for Indian investors, the implications of the US rally are different from those for American investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized that the real problem for Indian investors is not exposure to the US per se, but excessive dependence on a single geography and theme. A narrow market rally, stretched valuations, and currency movements create asymmetrical risks. Punj pointed out that Indian investors face a double-layered risk during a US correction. “A US pullback driven by an AI correction could see stocks fall. If stocks fall, capital may move out of the US, causing the dollar to weaken against the rupee, hitting Indian investors both ways." Onkar added that international investing should follow a diversified approach rather than revolve around the US alone. For most Indian investors building global exposure, the weakness lies in the absence of meaningful allocation to the rest of the world. Beyond the USThe US comprises half of the global market capitalization. Therefore, any diversified global portfolio, noted Onkar of PPFAS Mutual Fund, cannot and should not exclude the US entirely. “If one has to build global exposure, investors will need to accept US markets as being part of that diversified portfolio. Also, looking at it purely from a US and non-US perspective might disadvantage investors as they won't be able to participate in sectors that are leading with growth," he explained. Many innovative companies across sectors are listed in the US but earn cash flows from across the world. Also Read | Investing abroad: Here are the pros and cons of using old and new routes Nevertheless, valuation opportunities outside the US look more balanced. Punj highlighted Europe and Japan as attractive regions. Europe offers broad-based exposure through cyclical sectors, industrials, and stable dividend-paying companies that have significantly lagged US valuations. Japan, despite its strong run, continues to benefit from corporate governance reforms, improving shareholder returns, and valuations that remain appealing in many long-neglected sectors. Overcoming the fears of technical recession until a few months ago, meaning two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, Japan’s equity market remains anchored by sustained reform momentum. Recent reports from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs indicate that Japanese equities are undergoing a structural re-rating, driven by rising dividends, record buybacks, and stronger board independence, marking a significant departure from decades of economic stagnation. Among emerging markets, Brazil appears particularly compelling. Punj noted that Brazil trades at low-teen price-to-earnings multiples while benefiting from commodity demand, structural reforms, and higher foreign participation. Taiwan and Korea also offer exposure to the global semiconductor supply chain, but remain more volatile and sensitive to US tech sentiment. Punj suggests that Indian investors diversify across developed markets like Europe and Japan, with modest exposure to emerging markets. “Retail investors should restrict international allocation to 20% of the overall portfolio, and as far as allocation outside the US is concerned, currently should focus on Europe/Japan, 80%, and some allocation to emerging markets like Brazil, 20%," he said. Diversification through mutual fundsInterestingly, mutual fund data suggests that Indian investors have already started rebalancing to other geographies. Several international funds outside the US have seen significant AUM growth. The Invesco India-Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund grew from ₹25 crore in December 2024 to ₹170 crore in October 2025, a jump of 580%. The Axis Greater China Equity FoF saw its AUM rise 488% to ₹1,501 crore over the same period. These trends show growing willingness among investors to explore opportunities beyond US-centric products. Onkar stressed that even outside the US, there are pockets of expensive and reasonably priced businesses. “Valuation opportunities exist everywhere, even in markets that appear overvalued in aggregates," he said. So, instead of betting on single countries, he recommended multi-geography ETFs, which offer instant diversification without requiring investors to track individual stock stories across continents. Saurabh Mittal, CFA and founding director at wealth manager Circle Wealth Advisors, said most client portfolios maintain 10% to 15% international exposure. But after the sharp US rally in recent months, the weight of US funds has naturally risen. “What we are doing is just rebalancing those allocations and bringing them back to desired levels," he explained. Money is also being shifted from US-specific funds to broader global indices like the MSCI World Index. “But even in the MSCI World Index, US stocks are approximately 75%. So you are not immune to what happens in the US," he said. The MSCI World Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 23 Developed Markets (DM) countries.

Title: Wall Street Says Microsoft Can Hit $650. Here’s the Path
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/13/wall-street-says-microsoft-can-hit-650-heres-the-path/

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has delivered solid returns in 2025, but shares remain below their 52-week high of $553.50. The stock currently trades around $479. Despite the pullback, fundamentals remain robust. Microsoft reported revenue of $77.67 billion in its most recent quarter, beating estimates by nearly $2.3 billion and marking 18.4% year-over-year growth. Azure grew 40% as enterprises accelerate digital transformation. CEO Satya Nadella continues positioning Microsoft at the center of the AI revolution, with Copilot AI assistants embedded across its productivity suite. With momentum building around AI monetization and cloud growth, investors are wondering how high shares could climb in 2026. Analysts are decidedly bullish. The consensus 12-month price target sits at $625.41, implying 30.5% upside from current levels. That optimism reflects strong conviction: 56 of 57 analysts covering the stock rate it a buy or strong buy, with just one hold rating and zero sells. This near-unanimous support stems from Microsoft’s impressive growth trajectory. Wall Street expects revenue growth to continue in the high teens, driven by Azure’s expansion and increasing AI adoption across enterprise customers. Earnings per share estimates have been climbing, with analysts forecasting continued double-digit earnings growth as Microsoft scales its AI infrastructure investments. The company has beaten earnings expectations in 11 of the past 12 quarters, suggesting actual results will likely exceed forecasts. At today’s price of $479, Microsoft trades at roughly 30x forward earnings. At $650, shares would trade at approximately 41x forward earnings. That represents a premium valuation, but it’s not entirely unreasonable for a company growing earnings at 12.7% annually while maintaining a 48.9% operating margin and 35.7% profit margin. The S&P 500 trades around 22x forward earnings, meaning Microsoft would command nearly double the market multiple. However, Microsoft’s combination of scale, profitability, and growth justifies a premium. The company generated $293.81 billion in trailing revenue while posting a 32.2% return on equity. What could push Microsoft to $650? Several catalysts stand out. Reaching $650 would require a 35.7% gain from current levels. While ambitious, Microsoft has achieved returns of this magnitude multiple times historically. The stock delivered 57% returns in 2023 and has posted annual gains exceeding 35% in numerous years since 2000. With Microsoft now a $3.56 trillion company, repeating triple-digit returns is less likely, but 35% gains remain within reach given the company’s growth profile and market position. At the end of the day, the market’s sentiment on AI will likely shape Microsoft’s gains next year. Right now, media mentions of ‘AI bubble’ are at an all time high. Yet, if Microsoft were to accelerate Azure even higher (some third party estimates have predicted Azure growth could hit nearly 50% by the end of 2026), Micorosft could surpass a $5 trillion valuation and hit $650 per share. Hitting $650 per share would require Microsoft to gain 35.7% in 2026. Wall Street is already forecasting 30.5% upside, and the company’s consistent earnings beats suggest actual results will exceed expectations. If AI adoption continues accelerating, Azure maintains its growth trajectory, and the broader market cooperates, $650 is achievable.

Title: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse Shares Key Institutional Signal, Makes Bold XRP Prediction For 2026‬
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-shares-key-institutional-signal-makes-bold-xrp-prediction-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-13T18:37:27Z
Full Content:
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has outlined what he considers one of the clearest signs that institutional capital is finally entering the crypto market, despite recent volatility. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance CEO Richard Teng, Garlinghouse said XRP ETFs have already raised over $700 million in just a few weeks. According to Ripple’s CEO, that surge reflects pent-up demand from institutions that previously avoided the asset due to a lack of U.S. regulatory clarity. Garlinghouse emphasized that the shift in U.S. policy has been dramatically under-priced. With the world’s largest economy representing 22% of global GDP, the removal of long-standing regulatory hostility marks a critical turning point. Major financial firms, including Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and even Vanguard, which once refused to touch crypto, are now entering the space. That situation fuels Garlinghouse’s strongest optimism for 2026. That said, Brad Garlinghouse noted that crypto still represents just 1–2% of the global ETF market. He dismissed concerns about short-term ETF outflows and declared there is “no chance” the asset class remains this small by 2026. For Ripple’s institutional brokerage arm, the trend is already visible: firms that stayed sidelined due to risk aversion or regulatory uncertainty are now beginning to “crawl, then walk, then run.” Moving on, Garlinghouse said the recent market turbulence has not scared institutions. “Definitely not,” he told the panel, arguing that volatility is pulling more interest in rather than pushing capital out. On the payments front, the Ripple CEO highlighted the company’s growing stablecoin business, which recently surpassed a $1 billion market cap and has secured approvals in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and the DIFC. The company is seeing accelerating demand for stablecoin-based treasury flows, boosted further by upcoming U.S. legislation such as the GENIUS Act. Moreso, Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury is reinforcing that momentum. Looking ahead, Garlinghouse expects meaningful U.S. regulatory legislation to pass in the first half of 2026, setting up what he believes could be a transformational year for XRP and the broader market.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin BTC$90,171.37 still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant's begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Of course, Santa doesn’t come around every single year, and while a market pullback alongside a big lump of coal could be left under the tree instead, I’d argue that it makes more sense to consider the year ahead or even the next three years than the next three weeks. Like it or not, seasonal rallies don’t always materialize, even when it seems like a Goldilocks environment is in place, and the stage is set for markets to end a strong year with one last final leg higher. While it’s impossible to know what’s up next in the near term, I do find the following stocks a great value as we enter the best time of the year. For some reason or another, it feels like a lackluster year for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), even though it’s way ahead of the S&P, up close to 33% year to date. Historically speaking, it’s a less remarkable year for the stock, even though the results have been nothing short of spectacular. Undoubtedly, it seems as though expectations have caught up with the legendary GPU maker. And while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPUs and other ASICs could erode a bit of the competitive edge, I do think that it’s a mistake to count Nvidia out of the game, given the power of raw AI compute. If AI innovators are serious about moving on the path to recursive self-improvement and achieving some form of superintelligence, arguably, there isn’t enough computing power to go around. While Google TPUs pose a risk to Nvidia’s dominance, I’d argue that the massive performance leap made by Gemini 3.0 shows that AI advancement isn’t plateauing. And, at the end of the day, that’s good news for the AI trade and demand for all kinds of AI chips. While Dr. Michael Burry might be betting against the firm, I wouldn’t seek to do the same, especially as AI monetization, agents, and continued advancement en route to AGI pave the way for continued spend on AI compute. Speaking of big AI spending, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) seems willing to swing for the fences, with a significant debt load and the potential to take on even more debt to keep building. Undoubtedly, the legacy software company is undergoing a profound, but pricey, and arguably risky debt-fuelled transformation. There’s a lot of execution and overbuild risk here. And there’s also the risk of what happens to OpenAI, one of its biggest customers. Though Oracle shares aren’t without more than their fair share of risk, I do think there’s also explosive upside if management can deliver and AI demand stays robust through 2030. At this juncture, all signs suggest there isn’t enough compute to go around, and Oracle would be right to be aggressive about scaling up and improving its slice of profits in the AI revolution. In any case, if there’s a global AI compute shortage, more firms on the supply side have to step up to the plate. While companies across the board could pull back on spending, especially if monetization doesn’t live up to its potential, or if a “data wall” of sorts drags on the pace of model advancement, I do think far fewer investors are focusing on what could go right these days (many analysts see considerable upside from these depths), especially as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) accelerates its growth and becomes a bigger slice of the total revenue pie. Undoubtedly, anywhere there’s a considerable debt load and nerves about a potential AI bubble bust, there’s bound to be extreme fear about what could happen if things don’t go as planned (think an AI pause or cooldown of sorts). And while I’m no fan of adding to an already sizeable debt pile to keep the foot on the gas, I do think Oracle’s bold bet might just pay off as AI innovators seek as much compute as they can get to power the AI revolution. After tumbling close to 12% on a second-quarter revenue miss, I think there might be an opportunity to buy. The AI backlog is booming, and guidance is upbeat, but, then again, it’s hard to ignore the free cash flow situation and all that debt, which may very well backfire in a big way if an AI bubble does burst in the new year.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. US President Donald Trump. Photo / Carolyn Van Houten, The Washington Post THE FACTS How will we remember 2025? When it comes to the economy, the answer is: not fondly. It’s going to go down as the year of the recovery that didn’t happen. There is no question that the psychological blow of thinking an economic recovery had begun and then having it all dashed was substantial. It has cast a pall over the whole year, even though the data will show that we saw growth in the first quarter and that it (most likely) returned in the third and fourth quarters. We finally get third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) numbers next week, and economists are expecting a strong bounce – perhaps as much as 1% for the quarter. We’ll also likely see revisions that show the terrible second quarter wasn’t as bad as we thought. We’ve had some promising data in the last few weeks that suggest the recovery has really gathered steam in the fourth quarter. Electronic card spending for November was much stronger than expected. So perhaps history will eventually show that 2025 wasn’t as bad as we thought it was. Unfortunately, how bad we thought it was is what counted while we were in it ... if that makes any sense. If we needed reasons to be gloomy, there was plenty of grim stuff – rising unemployment, business liquidations and stubborn inflation – to justify our mood. I should probably point out that this isn’t a preview for next week’s GDP release. This is officially my go at writing a year in review. It’s traditional in journalism to get these year-in-review pieces out early. No one wants to look back after Christmas. It’s more fun to speculate about the year ahead. Well, even more so this year, I reckon. There are plenty of businesses that will be more than happy to rule a line through this one. It’s the hope that kills you, people say – usually about their favourite sports team. So it was with the economy in 2025. But with what’s left of my weekly word count, let’s take a look at some of the highlights and lowlights. You can bet the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) will be relieved to see the back of 2025 after what has been, to quote the late great Queen, an annus horribilis (at least from an HR point of view). Controversy about the departure of Adrian Orr and the subsequent mess around the disclosure of information has been one of the biggest and most distracting economic stories of the year. The return of Donald Trump to the White House has also dominated news headlines. There have been so many big Trump headlines; some are saying the biggest, most impressive headlines in history. The big one that mattered most for New Zealand was Trump’s highly staged “Liberation Day” tariff show on the front lawn of the White House on April 2 (local time). With the weird pontification and bizarre mathematical workings, it might have been the year’s best comedy if it hadn’t delivered a very real blow to a global economy that didn’t need any more blows. Liberation Day coincided with the arrival of the second financial quarter, the one that delivered our GDP growth shocker – a 0.9% quarterly contraction. The Government and the RBNZ used the tariff shock as an explanation for the slump, but I’m yet to meet an economist who buys that line. New Zealand hasn’t had an issue with its export earnings in 2025. We’ve had record prices for meat, dairy and kiwifruit. Our economic issues have primarily been local. An exodus of Kiwis and a fall in arrivals have resulted in a crash in the net migration rate. That’s created a headwind for the property market, which has failed to recover. In fact, in Auckland and Wellington, property prices have kept falling. Consumers stopped spending and concentrated on saving and paying down debt – slowing the pass-through of interest rate cuts to retailers. Both business and consumer confidence (or mojo, as the PM calls it) went missing in action. The tariffs may have initially rattled local confidence too, but they quickly offered up a silver lining. They have reassured and reminded the world that we shouldn’t take anything Trump says at face value. Taco (Trump always chickens out) gets my vote for acronym of the year. Within weeks of Liberation Day, Trump was forced to back down on his hardline stance with China. Given China’s dominance of the vital rare-earth minerals trade, it always held all the cards. The delays to the US-China trade war showdown have kept coming. But despite interim tariffs in excess of 30% on Chinese goods, China has just reported a record US$1 trillion ($1.7t) trade surplus with the world. The standoff has also lifted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s popularity as he rides a wave of nationalist sentiment. As they say in China: Chuan Jianguo. Literally that means “Trump the nation-builder”, although in context, it’s a sarcastic play on the Maga slogan “Make America Great Again”. I visited China in September, and naturally, they showed me all the good stuff – so I might be a bit bullish. China’s had its problems in 2025 – an ongoing property slump, low consumer confidence, high youth unemployment – but losing the trade war has not been one of them. Faced with rising inflation at home, Trump has also been forced to back down on tariffs for meat, dairy and horticultural products. Financial markets have been a bright spot for the US economy in 2025 – underpinned by a frighteningly rapid artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Wall Street has wobbled at times. But as we head into the silly season, financial markets look to have shaken off any fears we’re in an AI bubble. Big investors, like US investment giant BlackRock, have decided that the high-tech revolution is genuinely transformational and the hype is justified. Whether it’s good for humanity is another issue, but our KiwiSaver accounts may be safe to look at for a while yet. There’s still time for things to go wrong in 2025, of course. It might be all over bar the shouting, but sometimes the shouting can be consequential. We’ll see. I’ve got one more Sunday column left in me this year. Hopefully, the road is clear for a look ahead at what 2026 might bring ... Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the NZ Herald.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks

Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin BTC$90,171.37. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

Title: Why Binance’s Bitcoin Reserves Keep Falling – And Why It’s Actually Bullish‬

Bitcoin reserves on Binance have fallen to their lowest level in five years, according to new data from CryptoQuant. Despite BTC hovering near $93,000, analysts say the decline is not a bearish signal. Instead, it reflects deeper structural shifts that are typically associated with strong market conditions, not weakening ones. The largest driver behind the outflows is the accelerating move toward self-custody. As prices rise, long-term holders and high-net-worth investors increasingly transfer their BTC to cold wallets, removing potential sell pressure from exchanges. This pattern, historically typical in bull markets, signals confidence and long-term conviction rather than fear. That said, the rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs builds on this. U.S. issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and, more recently, Vanguard, are attracting heavy inflows. However, these assets are custodied outside centralized exchanges. As institutional capital moves into ETF structures, exchange reserves naturally shrink. Analysts view this as a structural sign of institutional adoption rather than distress. A third factor is the recent derivatives reset. The late-November sell-off triggered sweeping liquidations, particularly during Asian trading hours, reducing margin deposits and the amount of BTC held on Binance. This dynamic is short-term and mechanical, rather than reflective of a broader shift in sentiment. Binance’s recent compliance upgrades have also prompted some users to rebalance holdings. However, this represents regulatory normalization rather than negative pressure. Overall, a decline in exchange reserves typically tightens the circulating supply. That environment has historically supported medium- to long-term appreciation. The current trend aligns with a market in re-accumulation mode. In other news, corporate adoption and AI-driven models fuel forecasts above $150,000, and a break below the $102.6K support could validate bearish technical setups. Moreover, CoinMarketCap data shows that macro and technical conditions are supportive. BTC has rebounded 11% from November’s $82K low, helped by “seller exhaustion” after roughly $19 billion in liquidations cleared excess leverage. A bullish MACD crossover and neutral RSI suggest room for upward momentum, with resistance at $101K and support at $86.3K.

Title: Well, That's Embarrassing: The Biggest Tech Fails of 2025
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/news/34142/well-thats-embarrassing-the-biggest-tech-fails-of-2025

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 this week.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it?—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 this week.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC.

Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 this week.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it?—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks That Could Be Due for a Face-Ripping Rally in 2026

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Koto Amatsukami / Shutterstock.com I left my crystal ball at home, but I’m going to be doing my best halloween impression in trying to put forward three growth stock picks that could be due for major rallies in the year to come. I do think 2026 will be a year that will feature plenty of innovation, in a number of different sectors. From artificial intelligence to machine learning to a plethora of other growth areas of the economy set to be reshaped by innovative new technologies, there are plenty of unique opportunities in this market for investors to choose from. I’d argue there are hundreds or thousands of such companies that will likely outpace the growth of the market in the year to come. That said, over the years I’ve condensed my watch list down to a few companies I watch intently. Among this group, here are three of the top opportunities I think could soar in 2026, if conditions remain in place for this bull market rally to continue. One of the more speculative small-cap picks I’ve been pounding the table on of late is The Metals Company (NASDAQ:TMC). I’m not going to stop, as nothing’s changed for me about the company’s underlying growth thesis. In fact, I’d argue that recent developments make this stock even more attractive for those with truly long-term investing time horizons. With a number of recent permit approvals to continue exploratory mining activity, and the potential to take a first-mover position in a highly lucrative sector pending some additional approvals that need to take place, TMC is a company that’s closer than many think to commercial mining operations. The question is how to value the company’s future cash flows, and that’s tricky business. But I’d argue that so long as the commercialization story continues on the track it’s on, the current positioning of The Metals Company provides plenty of upside potential. As revenue and earnings continue to grow off of a very low base, I think this is a stock that could have parabolic upside at the end of the day, and 2026 could be the year the fireworks really take off. In the world of mega-cap tech stocks, I’d suggest that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could actually have one of the most attractive forward price-earnings multiples of any of its peers. At just 24-times forward earnings, Nvidia’s status as a leading growth stock may only be unmatched by value investors looking at this company and deciding to pick up shares for their own portfolio. I’m not going to go so far as to say Nvidia is cheap here, but it’s the cheapest this stock has been in years on a relative price-earnings-to-growth ratio. My recent piece covering the bull thesis around Nvidia, and specifically how this stock could get to $300 per share, is worth a read. But the gist of this article is really that the company’s next-generation Rubin chips could be the key to unlocking massive growth in the New Year. We’ll have to see how AI companies adopt new chip technologies, and if competitors will eat into Nvidia’s market share. That’s certainly a risk. But in terms of stocks with massive upside potential in 2026, I think it would be negligent for most investors to not at least take a look at Nvidia here. If there’s one Magnificent 7 stock with a more attractive valuation multiple than Nvidia, we’re probably talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Shares of the search giant have absolutely soared of late due to a variety of bullish factors. The company’s Tensor Processing Units, used in Alphabet’s core Gemini LLM platform (but also increasingly being used by other players in the AI race), provides Alphabet with its latest cash flow growth catalyst investors are trying to price in. This is already a company with a dominant market share in search, with its media business (mainly YouTube) seeing skyrocketing revenue and earnings quarter after quarter. But the potential for Alphabet to become a household name in not only providing some of the highest-quality generative AI applications in the market, but also potentially becoming a competitor to Nvidia in this very profitable sector, has many investors (including Warren Buffett) jumping aboard. There’s no greater accolade given to any company than that, in my books. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently the world’s largest company with a market capitalization of $3.25 trillion valuation. Indeed, in the minds… I’ve got some good news for readers: I’ve dusted off my crystal ball.

Business An exterior view of the Oracle Field Office at Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo NEW YORK, Dec 12 : The red-hot trade backing artificial intelligence-related stocks has taken a bruising from back-to-back troubling updates from Oracle and Broadcom, reigniting concerns about frothy valuations and an AI bubble. Still, investors say reasons for optimism about AI remain intact, and many are wary about calling a top. Investors have piled into AI-related companies this year as the technology has taken off, with promises to make Corporate America more efficient. But some investors feel AI-related shares are overvalued. High-profile names such as Michael Burry have been bearish, comparing the recent AI boom to the 1990s dot-com era. For now, however, short-selling has been limited to smaller companies, with few pressing bearish bets against the biggest AI names.

Title: Intel said to have pursued deals that boosted CEO’s fortune

Full Content:
When the chairman of artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s chief executive: Lip-BU ​Tan. Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters. Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks to Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company. Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. ‍The competition for the start-up drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion (€1.7 billion) valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion. Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the start-up’s returns at Meta’s expense. Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.” The events show one of at least three instances ‍where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for start-ups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. [ Lip-Bu Tan, Intel CEO with Silicon Valley’s toughest turnaround jobOpens in new window ] Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment. Intel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a long-time investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank. Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or companywide transaction, the sources said. Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said. In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to chief financial officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan. Intel declined to make Zinsner available for ‌an interview. Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic US chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said. Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.” [ US government investment in Intel looks bad for LeixlipOpens in new window ] Tan’s deal making comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating ⁠it as strategic to the US and effectively making its citizens shareholders. Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.” Tan does not perceive his deal making at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these start-ups and at Intel ‌make him ​uniquely able ‍to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said. In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s deal making posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalise on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.” The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date. US regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock. Tan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalising its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.” Rivos was one of the big targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing start-up SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said. The rationale – ⁠debated inside Intel – was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said. SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the start-up and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said. Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks. Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the US chip manufacturer’s CEO ⁠was “highly CONFLICTED.” According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on US national and economic security. ⁠In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal. Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. Soon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganised the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change. Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A & E Investment, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources ‍said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said. One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the start-up, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A & E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows. ProteanTecs declined to comment. A & E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan “has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.” Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show. Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows. Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million. Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s deal making raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies. One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don’t want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specialising in corporate disclosures and insider trading. The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova. Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.” The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special ‌committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, ‌and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information. Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure. The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said. The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which predated Tan’s leadership. In 2018, SambaNova was a start-up with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on ‌its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper. SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the start-up’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which ⁠is designed for more specific AI applications. In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip start-up tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said. Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the start-up, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the start-up recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.” Deal talks to SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said. – Reuters © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much. Nigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process. "We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here," he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager. The strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is "upskilling itself to meet the moment," Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs. "In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that," he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said. Williams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process. Despite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews. There's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though. Williams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail. "It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'" Williams said. BlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report. BlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be "some huge winners and huge failures" with the technology. Jump to

Title: ‘Digital labubu’: Why Vanguard still refuses to endorse Bitcoin

Can Bitcoin thrive when its biggest gatekeepers refuse to believe in it? Bitcoin retreated from its recent peak as selling pressure returned across the broader market. At press time, BTC traded near $92,000, extending a drawdown from its recent high, according to Bloomberg data. The pullback revived familiar concerns around Bitcoin’s boom-and-bust cycles, even as institutional access continued to expand. The latest weakness coincided with sharp criticism from Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers. Despite opening its platform to allow clients to trade spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, the firm doubled down on its skepticism. Speaking at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth event in New York, John Ameriks, Vanguard’s Global Head of Quantitative Equity, directly addressed the question of Bitcoin’s investment merit, dismissing the asset with a mocking comparison. He described the world’s largest cryptocurrency as a “digital Labubu,” referring to the viral elf-like plush toy. Ameriks used this comparison to reinforce Vanguard’s core view: Bitcoin produces “no income, no compounding, and no cash flow.” As a result, the $12 trillion asset manager treats it as a “collectible rather than a productive asset.” Moreover, Ameriks strengthened his argument by saying the firm has seen “no proof that the technology behind it offers lasting economic value.” His analogy continues a tradition of critics comparing Bitcoin to speculative manias, such as 17th-century Dutch tulips and 1990s Beanie Babies. These comparisons suggest that Bitcoin’s value is driven by scarcity narratives and the “greater fool theory,” rather than intrinsic utility or cash flows. The irony of Amerik’s comments is starkly highlighted by the dramatic policy shift that preceded them. Recently, Vanguard, under the leadership of newly appointed CEO Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive with a background in crypto, reversed its years-long resistance to digital assets. The firm, managing approximately $12 trillion in assets, allows clients to trade crypto-focused ETFs that hold coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], and Solana [SOL] on its brokerage platform, effectively placing them alongside gold and other mainstream assets. Ameriks said the decision followed the January 2024 debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which helped stabilize market infrastructure and liquidity. However, he emphasized that Vanguard offered access without endorsement or investment guidance. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion. We’re going to not give them advice as to whether to buy or sell, or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” Vanguard’s decision, therefore, represents a profound paradox at the heart of the maturing crypto market. The world’s second-largest asset manager began offering access to crypto ETFs and related mutual funds to its more than 50 million brokerage customers on the 2nd of December. This monumental policy shift, which dramatically reversed Vanguard’s anti-crypto stance in 2024, was driven by rising client demand. Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, said the ETF structure had “proven resilient during volatility” and maintained robust liquidity. At the same time, Vanguard mocks Bitcoin as a “digital Labubu” and avoids launching its own crypto products, showing it wants to meet demand without endorsing the asset.

Title: 'Time for gloves off': Asking religious orders nicely to pay redress hasn't worked, says Bacik

IT’S TIME TO take the gloves off and force religious orders to pay redress to their victims, according to Labour leader Ivana Bacik. Her party has put forward a Bill that seeks to enact landmark legislation to ensure that religious institutions, associated trusts, and other unincorporated organisations be held liable for historic child sexual abuse committed in their care. Tánaiste Simon Harris, when Taoiseach, said he expected those who speak Christianity to practice it, stating that the government has “levers” to ensure the religious orders pay up. He told The Journal last year that he had asked the Attorney General to draft legal advice for government about what mechanisms can be deployed or what legislation could be introduced to make sure that institutions have to contribute towards redress. However, since then, there has been no progress with the legislation. Bacik said in her previous life as a barrister, she represented many survivors of abuse in industrial schools, and she described the residential institutions redress board as “a flawed process” that has been subject to much critique. “One of the key issues was that the religious orders simply were not not paying their share of the redress… what has happened over decades is that religious orders have transferred their assets to lay-run trusts,” she said. Advertisement An example is the government-established Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme, which sought for religious bodies to contribute around €270m to the costs. However, only two of eight religious bodies linked to Mother and Baby Homes in Ireland offered to contribute. The Sisters of Bon Secours offered €12.97m, while the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul proposed contributing a building to the scheme. Since then, there is a whole new cohort of people who have come forward with claims of abuse, with Bacik mentioning David and Mark Ryan, who were featured in the RTÉ’s Doc on One programme ‘Blackrock Boys’. In more recent times, claims have “absolutely exploded”, said Bacik, noting that the new scoping inquiry into sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders identified 42 religious orders, over 300 schools and 3,000 allegations. “And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” “So we drafted a bill to enable proceedings to be taken against an unincorporated body, which is the legal status of a religious order, so that survivors or the State can pursue for unpaid redress,” she said. Bacik said there shouldn’t be a delay in taking action, stating that she believes this sort of legislation can run parallel to the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Historical Child Sexual Abuse in Schools, which is ongoing. The commission will investigate the handling of allegations or concerns of historical child sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools in Ireland, including special schools, which occurred between 1927 and 2013. “I’m disappointed that the lack of action by government, because, in fact, I spoke in the Dáil two years ago on this, and the then-minister said he was very interested, and said that he would go to the Attorney General and look for advice… nothing’s happened since the scoping inquiry was established,” she said. Related Reads €86 million cash in the bank, but the majority of religious organisations haven't offered any redress Redacted Lives: Catch up on our documentary series about Mother and Baby Homes Redacted Lives: Why survivors felt let down by the Commission into Mother and Baby Homes “For decades, successive governments and ministers have gone cap in hand to the religious orders, and frankly, it’s time for gloves off. No more of this asking nicely, because the religious orders are digging their heels in. They’re protecting their assets, and it’s just not good enough. “We need this legal mechanism to be able to get behind these legal entities, and be able to secure a redress for survivors. We know the wealth religious orders and their trusts are sitting on is huge,” the Labour leader said. The Journal reported earlier this year that almost all religious orders in Ireland have millions of euros in cash and assets. The eight religious bodies with historical involvement in mother and baby homes have combined net assets of €1.32 billion and cash deposits of €86 million. In a statement from the Department of Education regarding where progress is when it comes to legislation, a spokesperson said the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders, a Commission of Investigation has been established by the government. They noted that inquiry’s report also recognised the significance of the issue of redress for survivors and their expressed wish that those running schools where child sexual abuse occurred should be held accountable financially. “It recommended that consideration be given by the government to establishing a redress scheme for survivors. The high-level Inter Departmental Group (IDG) established to advise Government on the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry also recognised redress as an important element of accountability for survivors and advised in its report that, based on knowledge of other schemes in the State and beyond, further detailed research and data analysis work needs to be undertaken on the consideration of any potential redress scheme that may be established in the future. “This work is ongoing and will continue in parallel to the work of the Commission, which does not have a role in relation to redress. “Given the complex issues involved, it is clear that further analysis and significant legal consideration will be required in assessing any proposed legislation to be brought forward in this regard,” the concluded.

The Bateman Cup will have a new name on the trophy after Clontarf host Ballynahinch in the final at Castle Avenue on Saturday (kick-off 4pm) in a game that also doubles up as a Division 1A match and will be televised live on irishrugby+). Clontarf, unbeaten at home this season and defending 1A champions, are in their first Bateman final in a decade. Former UCD back three player Ross Deegan is fit again and starts on the wing, with Hugo Lennox at fullback, meaning Tadhg Bird and Alex O’Grady each shift to midfield. Up front, Andy Wood has picked an unchanged front five with Alex Soroka back from Leinster duty and the fit-again Jordan Coghlan both restored to the backrow. Hinch, in their first final, are also seeking a first win over ‘Tarf, who have completed the double over them in each of the last four seasons, for the first time since 2020. Paul Kerr moves from inside centre to outhalf in the absence of James Humphreys, who is on the bench for Ulster, tighthead Tom McAllister and number eight Bradley Luney return among five changes all told. The other four matches kick off at 2.30pm, with leaders St Mary’s (33 pts) hosting Lansdowne in third (23 pts). They welcome back fit-again talisman Conor Dean, with the prolific Mick O’Gara reverting to “12″ and Dan Goggin to “8″. Lansdowne promote scrumhalf James Kenny and inside centre Tom Daly, while Bobby Sheehan reverts to blindside in a new backrow alongside Ross O’Neill and Barry Fitzpatrick. After slipping to fourth following successive defeats, Terenure (25pts) head to Ollie Campbell Park to face Old Belvedere in eighth for a first AIL meeting since 2017. Chris Cosgrave moves to outhalf and Adam La Grue to fullback, with Connacht centre John Devine, all-time leading try scorer Craig Adams and scrumhalf Griffin Culver all restored. Ben Blaney is recalled and Harrison Brewer reverts to lock. Although Young Munster will welcome Conor Bartley’s call-up for Munster, Ger Slattery still retains all but three of the side which beat Terenure last week when they host Nenagh. UCD, boosted by last week’s 43-38 win at Lansdowne, have Andrew Osborne back on the right wing for the visit of Cork Constitution, who have won their last two and whose only change is a rotation at hooker, where Billy Scannell starts and Danny Sheahan is on the bench. In 2A and 2B, the AIL’s last unbeaten sides, MU Barnhall and Galwegians, are at home to Galway Corinthians and Skerries. Due to pitch conditions the AIL Junior Cup semi-final being played tomorrow between Seapoint and Athy will now be played at St Michael’s College, Dublin 4 on their 4G pitch. The kick-off time has also changed to 2pm. Bateman Cup Final: Clontarf v Ballynahinch, Castle Avenue, (kick-off 4pm – live on irishrugby+).

Title: Is testosterone the quick fix for women in midlife?

Humanity has always chased the promise of renewed youth. From ancient myths about the fountain of life to modern Silicon Valley regimes of supplements, sensors and self-tacking biohackers, the supposed elixir may change over time, but the desire for eternal youth remains the same. Today it appears everywhere, and it is often split along gendered lines. For women, the pursuit tends to be aesthetic, shaped by a culture that treats ageing as a flaw to be corrected via Botox, fillers, or – increasingly among actresses barely in their mid-30s – a facelift. Men, meanwhile, are urged to optimise. An entire industry of podcasts, tech devices and protocols encourages them to track their biomarkers, adapt their sleep cycles, and follow elaborate nutritional codes. It’s a thriving market built on the belief the body, ageing, time itself can all be mastered and controlled with enough science, discipline and money. Into this landscape enters a new supposed miracle tonic for women: testosterone. It may be a hormone as old as time, but it’s being worshipped with a new fervour. Influencers and wellness clinics are peddling unregulated, high-dose testosterone to women, promising not just heightened libido but sharper focus, renewed purpose and a vitality dormant for years. Some of the stories sound almost mythic. Women describe bounding out of bed, lifting heavier weights, rediscovering sexual desire, and feeling newly energised at work and at home. In one recent New York Times piece, women described sex going from “How about never?” to six times a week; marriages transformed, energy levels electrified, all apparently down to testosterone. The problem is, most of the claims about testosterone are simply not borne out by evidence. Step away from the viral testimonies and influencer marketing spiels and into the consulting rooms of clinicians who specialise in hormonal care, and the story of testosterone becomes far more measured, more grounded, more wary. This research-backed, evidence-based medical view is not anti-testosterone; it’s just anti-magic. Though long framed as the defining male hormone, testosterone is no more exclusively masculine than oestrogen is exclusively feminine; both circulate in all bodies, and both matter profoundly. “Testosterone is the third hormone that your ovaries make, along with oestrogen and progesterone,” explains Dr Caoimhe Hartley, the clinical lead in women’s medicine at the newly opened Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre. “It has an impact on bone density, muscles, probably cognition and sexual function, and that is where libido comes in. All these hormones do multiple things; they are not isolated to one usefulness.” What testosterone does not do is plummet dramatically at menopause, despite the common misconception. “There is no study that has shown any change over natural menopause,” says Prof Susan Davis, an endocrinologist at Monash University whose work has shaped global understanding of female testosterone. “Testosterone blood levels decline slowly from the age of about 20 through to the age of about 60,” she explains. Over those 40 years, she says, “on average, normal women will have about a 50 per cent decline.” Then, unexpectedly, levels start to creep up again from about 60. “It is changing with age, not menopause.” This distinction matters because it reframes midlife experiences. Changes that women may experience in metabolism, energy and mood are often misattributed to a sudden drop in testosterone, when the real cause may be the cumulative effects of ageing, stress, workload and emotional demands. But if testosterone drops over time and these emotional and embodied changes are experienced, a question naturally arises: does putting more testosterone into the body help? For premenopausal women, the answer right now is simply: we do not know. Two trials have hinted at some possible benefits for women in their late 30s and early 40s, “but the studies are too small to have any degree of confidence”, Davis says. Another trial is planned, but for now, “there is no good evidence that giving premenopausal women testosterone will be beneficial”. For postmenopausal women, the picture is clearer, though still limited. “All the published studies show that the only evidence of benefit is for postmenopausal women who are bothered by low libido,” Davis says. Her own meta-analysis of 36 trials involving 8,480 women found consistent improvements in desire, arousal, orgasm and overall sexual satisfaction. Though more modest than the accounts of teenage boy-levels of sexual desire experienced in women on high doses, these research-backed improvements were meaningful. “The beneficial effects for postmenopausal women shown in our study extend beyond simply increasing the number of times a month they had sex,” she says. “Many women who are sexually active report dissatisfaction, so increasing the frequency of a positive sexual experience from never or occasionally to once or twice a month can improve self-image and reduce concerns and distress.” Hartley sees the same patterns clinically. In Ireland, doctors can prescribe testosterone for women, but only off-label and only in carefully selected cases, such as postmenopausal women distressed by low libido. Because no female-specific product is licensed here, clinicians like Hartley rely on precisely titrated-down doses of male testosterone gels, monitored with blood tests to keep levels within a normal female range. She prescribes testosterone when low libido is causing distress, usually after menopause or after surgical removal of the ovaries. “It makes a bit of physiological sense,” she says of its use following surgical menopause, “but it is still for low libido and nothing else”. Beyond this specific use for improving libido for older or postmenopausal women, the evidence around the benefits of testosterone therapy for women fades. “No benefits have been shown for cognition, bone mineral density, body composition, muscle strength or psychological wellbeing at physiological doses,” Davis says of the clinical trials to date. “There simply isn’t evidence.” If testosterone’s proven benefits are relatively modest, why do some women who’ve taken it sound as if they have been converted to a new faith? Part of the answer is placebo. “There is a huge placebo effect, and everybody is in complete denial of this placebo effect,” Davis says. She points to a company that developed a testosterone gel for women and then ran two large trials of libido, each with 500 participants. “Testosterone improved libido, but not better than placebo,” she says. In her own 800-woman trial of a testosterone patch, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, women on testosterone had better sexual function than those on placebo. But when the team buried validated wellbeing questionnaires inside the study, they found no difference in general wellbeing at all. Hartley encounters the anecdotal power of testosterone every day. “I have patients who will come back and say, ‘I went on testosterone and my brain fog improved’ – and I am not in their brain, I cannot tell them that they are wrong.” The problem is that individual stories, which are very real to the woman telling them, are not the same as evidence. “How do you remove all the other things that may have helped? How do we know it is not placebo?” Hartley asks. “That is why we do studies.” But when women are looking for answers and hear one or two stories saying, ‘This transformed my life’, the effect is infectious. “It is human nature to want to believe it,” Hartley says. This gap between evidence and promise is sharpened by what happens outside regulated medical practice. In the US, an increasingly booming, unregulated industry of influencers and wellness clinics is offering female clients testosterone pellets and gels at doses that take women well beyond a normal female range for the hormone. At those levels, the side effects can be alarming: scalp hair loss, unwanted facial hair, acne, irritability, voice deepening, clitoral enlargement, and surges of arousal that disrupt daily life. Some of these side effects, like clitoral enlargement and voice changes, can be irreversible. Hartley notes that such dramatic changes “really should only occur if your testosterone level is bumped outside of a normal female range” – yet in unregulated settings, that boundary is routinely crossed. In countries like the United Kingdom or Australia, women have access to a licensed female-specific testosterone cream that allows safe, standardised dosing. In countries like the US or Ireland, without such a product, the gap between evidence-based prescribing and unregulated hormonal experimentation is widening, leaving women vulnerable to treatments that promise transformation but bypass the safeguards of medical care. “Knowing that this is an option that might help them, women are forced to use either compounded therapies or try microdose male options,” Davis says of countries without an approved product. “That is really where things go out the window, because it is very difficult to safely dose using very concentrated male formulations.” In her view, “the best thing to protect women is a regulated product”, one tailored to female physiology. Hartley would welcome the UK’s new female-specific cream for similar reasons. It contains the same active ingredient as existing male gels, she notes, just at a concentration and formulation that makes it easier to apply in tiny doses. Regulation, though, is not enough on its own – doctors need to understand the drug and how best to help their patients. For Hartley, the safeguard is information. “The more we have well-educated healthcare professionals at every level,” she says, “the more we are passing that on to women.” She wants GPs and specialists who are “well armed with information on what is evidence-based and what is rubbish”, so that they can help patients sift through hype and anecdote. Both Hartley and Davis think the fervour around testosterone says as much about the state of women’s lives as it does about the hormone itself. “I think women are sick of their symptoms being dismissed,” Davis says. “And when someone says this will make you feel better, of course, they want to take it. I get that, and I think that is perfectly reasonable.” Davis’s team has documented the decline in women’s quality of life at mid-age. Despite a huge amount of cultural discourse focusing on the so-called male loneliness epidemic, the documented mental health struggles of middle-aged women remain unacknowledged. “Women are suffering,” she says. “We have shown in our latest work that midlife wellbeing has gone down compared to 10 years ago. There is a real decline.” Davis explains the multitude of factors affecting women, noting: “This is the sandwich generation. Women trying to ‘have it all’: have children, take care of ageing parents, have work, have work-life balance, have financial stability. These are enormous pressures.” Depression rates are high, distress is high, and time is scarce. Hartley is watching the same pressures play out in Irish consulting rooms. “You see how much women are carrying,” she says. “It is no wonder their libido is low or that they feel flat or foggy or depleted. That is not a pathology. It is life.” Amid all the stresses affecting women, it thus becomes necessary to be careful of how we speak about women and low libido, in order not to pathologise a lack of desire that may be natural or due to a host of interlocking external factors, or to risk reinforcing damaging ideas about women owing their bodies and sexual availability to others. Neither doctor wants to minimise the distress of women whose sexual desire has vanished. Both prescribe testosterone in carefully selected cases, understanding the stakes for relationships and for individual self-esteem. “Our own research has shown that if women themselves personally have poor sexual wellbeing, that impacts them personally in their general wellbeing and their relationships,” Davis says. “So I prescribe testosterone for women with low libido. I am not anti-testosterone.” But what does concern Davis and Hartley is how the issue of women’s libido is often medicalised or framed. Hartley notes how many women come in apologising, or framing their lack of desire as a personal failure or a dereliction of duty to their partners. “Women come in saying, ‘Oh my God, my poor husband, my poor partner’,” says Hartley, who is always clear in redirecting them. “I say, ‘Your partner is not my patient’.” The real question is whether the woman herself is distressed. “It’s really important to not stick it on the list as something that has to be fixed. Low libido is not a disease,” says Hartley, who notes that it is a normal evolution for spontaneous sexual desire to reduce as you get older. ”That is universal. There is nothing wrong with you if that happens.” Davis notes that often, low libido is a “multifactorial condition”, and she points out that the guidelines from the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health set out a process of care that requires clinicians to look first at depression, relationship dynamics, medications, trauma, pain and vaginal health before they “jump in saying testosterone is going to be the fix”. Underpinning all of this, both the hope and the caution, is a simple fact: there is not enough research into women’s health, which leaves us without the data that women deserve. “The future, hopefully, is research,” Hartley says. Without larger, longer, better trials, she and her colleagues cannot give women the clear answers they want about benefits and risks. Davis has spent four decades trying to generate that data and sounds, at times, weary. Getting funding is brutally hard, she says; she can spend “up to 30 per cent” of her working time writing grant applications. When money does come through, another hurdle appears. “Trying to get women to go into clinical trials is an absolute no,” she says. “They are all too busy, busy.” Her team is about to start two large new studies, one looking at testosterone’s effects on muscle and bone, the other at bone and sexual function, both including wellbeing questionnaires. She welcomes the increased interest but insists that until the trials report, the honest answer to many questions will remain “we do not know”. That is not a comfortable message in a culture that wants a quick fix for midlife female exhaustion and desire. It is, however, the only message that treats women as adults and demands better for them in the long term. So what should an Irish woman do, sifting through a wave of hyped-up Instagram adverts about testosterone pellets and listicles of anecdotes about life-changing results? “Keep expectations realistic,” Davis says. If you are going to try testosterone, she urges, treat it as a time-limited trial, not a new identity. Do not try to treat bone loss, muscle fatigue or life itself with testosterone. “Testosterone is not the answer for life.” Hartley, for her part, hopes women will come in to talk, not arrive convinced that there is only one solution. “If they are symptomatic, if they have low libido and it is bothering them, and they want to have a discussion with their GP about it, do that,” she says. But she also wants them to hear something that often gets lost in the hype: “You are not broken.” She’s right. There is nothing inherently wrong about wanting sex less as you age. There is also nothing shameful about wanting more. But there is something deeply shameful about a society that devalues women; refuses to invest in research about their physical or emotional wellbeing; pathologises them for ageing and constantly tells them that they are not enough, only to try then make money selling them an unsafe, unregulated “cure”. Women deserve acceptance, accurate information and autonomy, not another marketplace built on their insecurity. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Planned taxi protests were called off earlier this week pending the outcome of a meeting at Government Buildings. Photo: Stock image A new Uber policy to offer customers fixed fares upfront does not breach taxi regulations, Transport Minister Darragh O’Brien has been told. A Department of Transport spokesperson revealed, however, that the minister has ordered a new assessment of licensing regulations in the wake of highly disruptive protests by taxi drivers opposed to the new rules. Mr O’Brien has asked the National Transport Authority (NTA) to carry out the review. It will examine the regulations including the role of booking apps and the technology used for charges. The move comes after the Taxi Drivers Ireland group suspended “go-slow” protests that could have caused major traffic disruption this week to enter talks. A spokesperson at Taxi Drivers Ireland said earlier this week that a further escalation of protest action was temporarily called off pending the outcome of a meeting at Government Buildings. The drivers had announced a “six-day national shutdown protest”. They called for government engagement on the future of the industry, claiming the Uber fixed-fare policy is destroying their livelihoods. When asked about the outcome of talks, a department spokesperson said a special meeting of an Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles took place on Thursday. Planned taxi protests were called off earlier this week pending the outcome of a meeting at Government Buildings. Photo: Stock image Taxi drivers stage further protest over Uber pricing The spokesperson said the minister had written to the NTA to request clarification on the regulatory position on the Uber fixed-price fare. “In the response to his letter, the minister has been advised by the NTA that the charging of a fixed fare is in accordance with the applicable regulations,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the minister was advised that the NTA will keep the regulatory model under review. Mr O’Brien asked that the matter was urgently considered at the special meeting of an Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles. Members of the committee include representatives of drivers, operators, consumer representatives, An Garda Síochána and the tourism sector. The committee recommended that more dispatch operator data is made available to the regulator and an examination of “technology charges” takes place. A department spokesperson said the committee expressed support for the regulatory model for small public service vehicles in Ireland which requires that all drivers and vehicles are licensed. “The committee is of the view that given changes in the taxi sector since the taxi regulation act 2013, there is a need to assess whether legislation is up to date regarding the roles of technology and booking app dispatch operators in the sector.” The department spokesperson said the SPSV (small public service vehicles) market “has undoubtedly changed” over the last number of years. “With this in mind, the minister has requested that the NTA conducts a regulatory assessment of dispatch operator licensing in Ireland in the context of ensuring that the regulatory framework for this element of the overall sector is sufficiently up to date and robust to respond to developments in the SPSV market since the enactment of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013,” the spokesperson said.

I am fortunate enough to celebrate Christmas twice each year, enjoying a Danish feast featuring pork and duck on Christmas Eve and the traditional Irish turkey dinner the following day. In the past, I did not open up my finest wines, but now the children have grown older so I am happy to serve some very nice wine. Usually, we enjoy a good mature Bordeaux on Christmas Eve, and a nice pinot noir or cool climate syrah on Christmas Day. I will cover sparkling wine next week, but a glass of something fizzy is a great way to get proceedings started and can be drunk throughout the meal. This is the time to open some of the fortified traditional Christmas wines. I also make room for a dessert wine of some sort. This year it will be the Château des Arroucats (€18.95, Mitchell & Son). I will certainly open a bottle of Amontillado sherry as well as a bottle of Port. I will then alternate between an after-dinner glass of sherry with cheese and walnuts one evening, and a glass of Port the next, either with cheese or a generous slice of Christmas cake. My sherry will be a bottle of Lustau Tabanco Amontillado (€23.95, Mitchell & Son) and the Port a late bottled vintage, Niepoort LBV (€28-30, independents). If that is outside your budget, try the Armilar LBV Port (Lidl €14.99). O’Briens has a big range of wines on offer, including those in its fine wine sale which started on December 1st. I have featured the refreshing Picpoul de Pinet (€12.99) before, as well as the classic Brocard Chablis (€22.99). I am a big fan of the Begude wines and would also be tempted by the very well-priced Etoile Chardonnay (€18.99). From the reds, the Château des Léotins (€11.99) offers good value, and would go with red meats or goose. The classic Cru Bourgeois Chateau Saint Bonnet Médoc 2018 (€17.99) is a step up in price and quality. The Seguin Manuel Bourgogne Pinot Noir (€27.49) would be a good choice for turkey and trimmings. Lastly, a small glass of the honeyed Les Carmes de Rieussec (€18.99 per half-bottle) would be a nice end to the meal. For fans of sauvignon, Aldi has the fruit-filled Touraine Sauvignon Blanc – very good value at €9.99. If you fancy trying something different, its Austrian Orange Wine (€11.99) is full of exotic (and orange) fruits with a light tannic bite on the finish. For your Christmas dinner you could either go for the light, fruit filled Specially Selected Fleurie (€13.99) or the more powerful rounded Specially Selected Cairanne (€11.99). From Lidl, I would recommend three white wines; the lemon-scented Rías Baixas Albariño Salne Val (€11.99), the crisp dry Fiano Salento (€10.99) and the luscious Origen Roussanne Reserva from Chile (€8.99). My pick of the Lidl reds for Christmas dinner includes the ripe and full-bodied Pure Grenache (€11.99), and the ever-popular Valpolicella Ripasso (€10.99) Traditionalists might prefer the Ermita Rioja Crianza (€13.99). A post shared by The Irish Times (@irishtimesnews) Regular readers will know I am also a big fan of the Laurent Miquel wines from Dunnes Stores, including the Laurent Miquel Côte 128 Viognier and the Côte 128 Albariño, both bargains at €12. Dunnes also has the Guigal Côtes du Rhône Blanc (€15) a rich viognier-dominated white that would go well with fish and turkey. I also enjoyed its smooth spicy 409 Ribera del Duero (€15), possibly best with roast beef or goose. Light and zesty, the Tesco Finest Pecorino (€12/€9) would go nicely with shellfish starters, and so too would its crisp dry Tesco Finest Chablis (€26). For a red wine, the Alegro Rioja (€15/€10) offers good value at the Clubcard price, as does the Chapoutier Côtes du Rhône Villages (€15/€12). To finish off, the Tesco Finest Sauternes (€18/€17 per half-bottle) is rich and honeyed with apricots and barley sugar. [ Favourite picks from Dublin’s longstanding independent wine shopsOpens in new window ] From SuperValu, the Goichot Pouilly-Fuissé looks well-priced at €15. Fresh and lightly textured, it could be drunk throughout the dinner. I have covered the Vacqueyras Rémy Ferbras before; smooth and rounded it offers good value at €10 and would go nicely with chicken and red meats. Also on offer are two perennial favourites, the Goichot Fleurie (€10) and the Château Lacombe-Cadiot from Bordeaux (€12). Can any wine be worth €140? I am not sure, but if somebody else is paying, I would very happily drink the Meursault Genevrières Premier Cru Latour-Giraud 2023 (€139, Whelehan’s), a superb complex white Burgundy, textured, ripe and rich with a wonderful lingering finish. Floral with broad textured mouthwatering green fruits and a distinctive saline finish. This is one of my favourite white wines and a great choice for Christmas dinner. From O’Briens An instantly drinkable wine with very supple savoury ripe plums and light tannins. One of my red wines of the year. From Lilith, Dublin 7; Pinto, Dublin 9; Green Man Wines, Dublin 6; Lennox Street Grocer, Dublin 8; Grapevine, Dalkey, Co Dublin; 64 Wine, Glasthule, Co Dublin; MacCurtain Wine, Cork; Baggot Street Wines, Dublin 2; BaRossa, Sandymount, Dublin 4 A delicious pure chardonnay with concentrated pear and apple fruits, toasted hazelnuts and a lingering finish. From WineSpark.com Elegant smooth and sophisticated, with supple savoury dark cherries and blackcurrants, fine tannins and a long finish. Try it with turkey, beef or goose.

You are expected to deliver a seamless, relevant experience for every single customer—true 1-to-1 personalisation—yet you are often armed with a fragmented stack of tools that treat your customers like rows in a spreadsheet. To overcome this, you need to consolidate customer data from all digital platforms, such as your website, social media, SMS, and mobile apps, to create a unified view of each customer.Currently, you might have an email platform for newsletters, a separate tool for SMS, a siloed system for customer support, and ad managers that don’t talk to your CRM. The result? A disjointed customer experience where a VIP shopper is treated like a stranger the moment they switch from their laptop to their mobile phone. Integrating these tools is essential to avoid data silos and enable a seamless customer experience across all touchpoints.This is where omnichannel marketing automation becomes more than just a buzzword; it becomes the fundamental requirement for survival and growth in the European eCommerce market.

This is where omnichannel marketing automation becomes more than just a buzzword; it becomes the fundamental requirement for survival and growth in the European eCommerce market. Why Multichannel is Not OmnichannelBefore we talk about the basics, we must clear up some common misconceptions. Many businesses believe they are practising omnichannel marketing simply because they are present on multiple channels.However, if you are sending emails, running Facebook ads, and offering SMS updates without a unified strategy, you might still only be doing multichannel marketing.Multichannel Marketing is channel-centric. The strategy focuses on the medium: “How do we grow our email list?” or “How do we get more clicks on Instagram?” These channels operate in silos, often competing with each other and confusing the customer.Omnichannel Marketing is customer-centric. The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows.Omnichannel marketing automation is the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. It is the ability to orchestrate a unified workflow where a customer’s action on one channel (e.g., viewing a product on the mobile app) instantly triggers a relevant reaction on another channel (e.g., a personalised email or a web pop-up), without any manual intervention. Ultimately, omnichannel marketing automation is essential for delivering a consistent experience across all touchpoints.The Foundation: You Must Analyse Customer Data FirstThe first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Before we talk about the basics, we must clear up some common misconceptions. Many businesses believe they are practising omnichannel marketing simply because they are present on multiple channels.However, if you are sending emails, running Facebook ads, and offering SMS updates without a unified strategy, you might still only be doing multichannel marketing.Multichannel Marketing is channel-centric. The strategy focuses on the medium: “How do we grow our email list?” or “How do we get more clicks on Instagram?” These channels operate in silos, often competing with each other and confusing the customer.Omnichannel Marketing is customer-centric. The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows.Omnichannel marketing automation is the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. It is the ability to orchestrate a unified workflow where a customer’s action on one channel (e.g., viewing a product on the mobile app) instantly triggers a relevant reaction on another channel (e.g., a personalised email or a web pop-up), without any manual intervention. Ultimately, omnichannel marketing automation is essential for delivering a consistent experience across all touchpoints.The Foundation: You Must Analyse Customer Data FirstThe first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4.

A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary The first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message.

ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history. First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history. Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4.

This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Context is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4.

Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation.

It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams.

We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams.

This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale.

Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale.

It is an aesthetic and a mindset that rejects the polished, minimalist perfection of modern life in favour of the chaotic, the cozy, the earthy, and the comfortably "ugly." It is about burrowing into a pile of blankets, collecting shiny trinkets,... As an email marketer, your job is a tough one: trying to send the right message, to the right person, at the perfect moment. And reaching this goal is as hard as catching unicorns - you may do everything right, prepare for every possible condition, polish your segments and emails, and still miss the target. Mostly, because unicorns are magical beasts so you will need... The eCommerce landscape is clear: AI is the future of growth. But this promise is constantly being challenged by a single problem: fragmentation. We must shift from a situation where integrating two systems takes months of engineering work to where complexity is handled by the platform, and we can focus on business execution. SALESmanago is a European SaaS company founded in 2012. We offer a powerful, feature‑rich Lifecycle Engagement Platform for digitally‑fueled ecommerce marketing teams, adopted by 2,000+ mid-size businesses across Europe, including iSpot, 4F, and Victoria's Secret.

Title: Trump gives Elon Musk a win over a longtime foe | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/business/musk-trump-shareholder-proxies-iss-glass-lewis
Time Published: 2025-12-12T23:51:28Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered a review of two major proxy advisory firms — companies that advise shareholders on votes — that had previously drawn the ire of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others in Corporate America. The executive order singles out the two biggest players in the market: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis. Proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis provide recommendations on how major investors like pension funds should vote on corporate decisions and at shareholder meetings — sometimes to the consternation of other shareholders or even corporate executives. Trump’s executive order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to review ISS and Glass Lewis specifically scrutinizing their use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social and governance policies (ESG). “Even if no immediate rules change, boards, institutional investors and the firms themselves take notice,” Kerry Berchem, a partner at Akin and co-leader of the firm’s corporate governance and activism practice, told CNN. “This can influence behavior indirectly — firms may alter recommendations, increase transparency, or adjust methodologies to avoid conflict with regulators.” The order is a win for Musk, who has bemoaned ISS and Glass Lewis’ role in advising shareholders. The advisory firms have previously recommended that investors vote against corporate decisions at Tesla like giving Musk a larger pay package. Some on Wall Street have also previously voiced concern about proxy advisory firms’ sway over shareholders’ decisions. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has argued against the companies, calling them “incompetent.” Elon Musk said he needs $1 trillion to stop ‘corporate terrorists’ from wresting control of Tesla ISS and Glass Lewis “use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,” including DEI and ESG, according to the order. These proxy advisory firms have offered research and advice that incorporates ESG investing, which has been slammed by many conservatives. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Corporate America has seen a broad shift away from DEI and ESG policies that were more widely embraced a few years ago. “President Trump and many Republican allies have made clear their concerns about ‘woke capitalism’ — the idea that corporations, investors, or advisors push political or social agendas (like ESG, DEI, climate policies) that he views as contrary to shareholder financial interests or traditional US economic priorities,” Berchem said. “President Trump’s move won’t immediately change proxy advice, but it signals scrutiny, assuredly rattles the industry and subtly shifts the power dynamic toward corporate boards,” she added. ISS, founded in 1985, and Glass Lewis, founded in 2003, advise major institutional investors like BlackRock, pension funds and a range of other asset managers. ISS and Glass Lewis are owned by companies in Germany and Canada, respectively. Institutional investors that manage up to trillions of dollars can invest in so many companies that, when it comes to annual shareholder meetings and votes, they need more insight on what to decide. Proxy advisory firms conduct research and advise on how to vote on decisions including, but not limited to, executive compensation, board structure, climate and environmental issues and potential mergers and acquisitions. “I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance,” Dimon wrote in his 2023 annual letter to shareholders. A spokesperson for ISS said in a statement that the company is aware of the executive order and will review it as it considers next steps: “ISS does not dictate or set corporate governance standards and remains firmly committed to operating professionally, ethically, independently, and in the best interests of our clients, as we have done historically.” A spokesperson for Glass Lewis said in a statement: “While we are still reviewing the full order, we appreciate the clarity it provides in understanding what the administration expects of all firms in the proxy advisory space. Glass Lewis has always operated with the highest ethical standards with our clients being at the center of everything we do.” Trump’s executive order highlights just how influential ISS and Glass Lewis have become, Lawrence Elbaum, an M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell and co-head of its shareholder activism defense practice, told CNN. “It’s on the heels of efforts by different states and other constituencies to try to curb ISS and Glass Lewis’ influence,” Elbaum said. “So I’m not surprised to see the executive order.” Attorneys from Sullivan & Cromwell are representing Trump in a New York criminal case. Elbaum is not affiliated with the legal defense. The proxy advisory firms have come under pressure in recent months. Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier, is suing ISS and Glass Lewis, alleging the companies are in violation of state antitrust laws. Trump’s executive order also directs the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether ISS and Glass Lewis are in violation of antitrust laws. Still, Elbaum cautioned, until any government reviews are completed, it’s hard to know what exactly will happen to the advisory firms. “I would say this EO is an initial momentum toward a ‘win’ for Musk and Dimon, but ultimately we won’t know whether there’s been a ‘win’ until this plays out further as the government agencies do their work,” Elbaum said.

Title: Affordability, AI Stocks, Parlays and Bad Bunny Top Investopedia’s Terms of the Year

Some weeks last a year, and some years feel like they last a decade. 2025 has brought us ten years' worth of news that has reshaped the global economy and financial markets at a breakneck pace. A tariff war, the AI of everything and the stocks tied to it, the proliferation of sports betting and the prediction markets, the entrance of cryptocurrencies into our federal banking system, and a relentless bull market were just some of this year’s headlines. Investopedia’s ever-curious readers stayed on top of all of these market-moving events as they circulated through our articles and financial terms that helped define these dynamics. Some events drew more interest and attention from our readers than others, demonstrating what was truly on the minds of educated investors in 2025. Here are Investopedia’s top terms of this year: Investopedia Investopedia No other word has captured the attention of our readers and most consumers this year. Inflation, although lower than the 2022 highs, remained persistent throughout the year and was amplified by the White House's aggressive tariff policies. Food prices, health care, and home prices remained persistently high, pushing consumer sentiment to lows not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. More Americans felt priced out of the so-called “American Dream," with the lack of home affordability among their top concerns. While some political leaders called the use of the word ‘affordability’ a ‘hoax’, many Americans who feel trapped in the bottom leg of the K-shaped economy felt its real effects in mounting debt and lack of savings. Tariffs dominated the headlines in 2025 and for the better part of 2024, making it our top term last year. Still, 2025 was shaped more by the impacts, or concerns about the impacts of tariffs on issues such as affordability (see above). That said, investors, consumers, and business owners needed a calculator and a good eraser to try to quantify the impact of tariffs on the real cost of goods, given how many times they were imposed, reduced, or reciprocated by the White House in 2025. There is no doubt that tariffs have become one of the key instruments of economic policy in the 2020s, and we should expect this term to remain popular. Among all the major asset classes in 2025, none shone brighter than gold. The precious metal surged more than 60% year-to-date, as investors, from global central banks to retail investors shopping at Costco on a Sunday, clung to it as the safe-haven asset it is known to be. Even as the stock market and Bitcoin steadily rose throughout most of the year, gold’s allure was too strong for those investors looking for a buoy to cling to in the tumultuous seas of tariffs and stock market uncertainty. Record gold prices spilled over into other metals, such as silver, which also hit record-high prices throughout the year. 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the super-scaling of the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem and infrastructure, and the stocks that took off with it. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA), have been benefitting from the build-out of AI for several years, 2025 was the year we saw companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) blow out their CapEx budgets to the tune of $380 billion, and pledging to spend even more over the next several years. The more they spent, the more their stock prices climbed, until, that is, the last quarter of 2025, when investors and executives began questioning whether these AI stocks are in a bubble. According to Investopedia's most recent sentiment survey, our readers agree. The Trump administration came into office pledging to make America the ‘Crypto Capital of the World’. It began that process by passing the Stablecoin Act of 2025, also known as the Genius Act. That established the first federal framework for payment Stablecoins in the U.S. Our readers wanted to understand what a Stablecoin actually is, how it compares to Bitcoin, and why our federal government wants to introduce a digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar into our banking system. 2025 will also be remembered as the year that sports betting, event betting, and predictive markets went mainstream. Americans are expected to wager over $150 billion in 2025, and with more states legalizing sports betting, bet on that number to grow. As it does, our readers wanted to learn more about the high-risk, high-reward parlay bet, which links together two or more individual bets, known as legs, but only pays out if every leg wins. While there weren’t any major convictions or charges of insider trading in 2025, our readers were searching for what it actually means and whether it was happening in front of us on several occasions this year. This term received extra attention in early April following the so-called “Liberation Day,” as the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on hundreds of trading partners, leading to a near 5% selloff in the S&P 500. As the stock market went on to fall as much as 19% in the subsequent days, the President’s post telling Americans to “Buy Stocks” just before he lifted or paused many of those tariffs on April 9th raised more than a few eyebrows, especially as the market roared back to record highs. Reports of government officials selling stocks before Liberation Day surfaced soon after, but charges were never filed. While technically not a financial term, Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, better known as ‘Bad Bunny,’ got as much attention for his business acumen and net worth as he did for his latest best-selling album. 2025 was a good year for Bad Bunny’s money, as he was Spotify’s most-streamed artist, sold out arenas around the world, including a residency in his home country of Puerto Rico, hosted SNL, and was selected to be the headline act at the Super Bowl in 2026. His net worth, according to our latest report, is $88 million, and climbing.

Inherently opaque, often risky, but tempting with upside potential, private markets have received a public reception from the new administration, which is lowering regulatory hurdles to allow them into defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. In August, President Trump signed an executive order to ‘democratize’ access to alternative investments, such as private markets, paving the way for their inclusion in retirement plans. Our readers sought to learn everything they could about private markets and their potential impact on their portfolios. One of the simplest strategies to generate income in the stock market this year was through covered calls in the options market. The strategy involves an investor who owns a stock with no intention of selling it, does not expect the price to move significantly, and sells a call option that generates a premium for the option's term. If the stock rises in price, the investor gets their premium payment plus the increase in the stock price, up to the strike price. If the stock falls, the investor still gets the premium, which offsets some of the loss. As the stock market has been churning sideways since September, more of our readers have wanted to learn and use this strategy.

Some weeks last a year, and some years feel like they last a decade. 2025 has brought us ten years' worth of news that has reshaped the global economy and financial markets at a breakneck pace. A tariff war, the AI of everything and the stocks tied to it, the proliferation of sports betting and the prediction markets, the entrance of cryptocurrencies into our federal banking system, and a relentless bull market were just some of this year’s headlines. Investopedia’s ever-curious readers stayed on top of all of these market-moving events as they circulated through our articles and financial terms that helped define these dynamics. Some events drew more interest and attention from our readers than others, demonstrating what was truly on the minds of educated investors in 2025. Here are Investopedia’s top terms of this year: Investopedia Investopedia No other word has captured the attention of our readers and most consumers this year. Inflation, although lower than the 2022 highs, remained persistent throughout the year and was amplified by the White House's aggressive tariff policies. Food prices, health care, and home prices remained persistently high, pushing consumer sentiment to lows not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. More Americans felt priced out of the so-called “American Dream," with the lack of home affordability among their top concerns. While some political leaders called the use of the word ‘affordability’ a ‘hoax’, many Americans who feel trapped in the bottom leg of the K-shaped economy felt its real effects in mounting debt and lack of savings.

Title: Senior Vanguard analyst says Bitcoin is no better than a plush toy

The comments followed the asset management company’s policy change allowing its clients to trade crypto exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset and is akin to a collectible toy, according to John Ameriks, the global head of quantitative equity at asset management company Vanguard. “It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” Ameriks said at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York City. Labulus are collectible plush toys featuring animals with anthropomorphic features. Despite Ameriks’ criticism, he said that Bitcoin (BTC) may have value beyond financial speculation in the future under certain circumstances. The cryptocurrency could find real-world use cases beyond market speculation in scenarios of high fiat currency inflation or political instability, Ameriks said. These forces drive the adoption of alternative currencies. The comments followed Vanguard’s announcement in December, allowing its clients to trade cryptocurrency funds for the first time, and highlight the doubts of analysts and executives in traditional finance about Bitcoin, even as its price hovers above $90,000, with 16 years of network uptime. Related: Bitcoin first, crypto at scale: Inside the UAE’s layered digital asset strategy Vanguard was the last of the three major asset management companies, which include BlackRock and State Street, to allow clients to hold crypto investment vehicles. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion,” Ameriks said, adding that Vanguard won’t offer investors “advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” The policy change gives Vanguard’s over 50 million clients exposure to crypto markets and creates yet another bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, funneling money into crypto networks. The fresh capital injections from Vanguard’s clients could boost prices for cryptocurrencies tied to exchange-traded funds.

Are investors ready to buy into Rivian's vision for its autonomous vehicles and AI? Shares of the electric vehicle maker surged 12% Friday, erasing yesterday's losses after an "Autonomy & AI Day" event where Rivian (RIVN) announced a custom AI chip and plans to roll out enhanced self-driving software. The move higher came during a down day for broader markets as worries about an AI bubble continued to pressure shares of big AI names such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron Technology (MU). Rivian said Thursday it will soon issue an update to its second-generation R1 vehicles that will expand the ability for hands-off driving to more than 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada, compared to under 150,000 miles previously. That would bring Rivian closer to Tesla's (TSLA) base Autopilot system in covering most roads in the U.S., Barclays analysts said in a note following the event. The analysts said the development, along with other updates, showcased Rivian's shift in strategy to focus more on autonomous and AI features as a way to differentiate its offerings in the face of a challenging EV market, and open up new high-margin revenue streams through subscriptions and licensing. Rivian said it plans to launch a subscription platform called Autonomy+ early next year that will deliver more advanced driving assistance features and be continuously updated as Rivian develops the software, much like Tesla's Full Self Driving (Supervised) service. Rivian expects to offer its subscription at $49.99 per month, or a one-time $2,500 purchase. Tesla's more advanced system costs $99 per month. Rivian also unveiled its own AI chip designed to replace the chips it currently buys from Nvidia (NVDA) to power its self-driving software. The Rivian chip and a LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, sensor system are each expected to be approved and added to Rivian's new R2 vehicles by late next year. The company is looking to add an AI voice assistant to first and second-generation R1 vehicles early next year. While Rivian shares slipped Thursday after its new autonomy projects were announced, amid a broader pullback in tech and AI stocks, Friday's gains and positive comments from analysts could point to renewed enthusiasm for the electric vehicle maker's stock. Barclays analysts told clients that while there are a number technical hurdles for Rivian to clear as it looks to catch up with Tesla and other self-driving competitors, they "appreciate this strategy, reflecting the strength of RIVN’s efforts in vertical integration, and reminding us that aside from Tesla, they are taking clear efforts to lead on software-defined vehicles in the west." While Rivian did not explicitly include plans for a fleet of robotaxis in Thursday's presentation, CEO RJ Scaringe hinted that the company's efforts in self-driving could also enable Rivian to pursue rideshare opportunities in the future. Offering a robotaxi service or providing its vehicles to ridesharing services once they are capable of self-driving would put Rivian in closer competition with Tesla, which launched a test pilot of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas earlier this year. While still well off their highs in 2021, Rivian shares have climbed close to 40% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500's 16% gain.

Title: Dave Ramsey: Two Questions That Separate the Rich and the Poor

Personal Finance The average American carries $104K in debt across mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and student loans. Credit card balances surpassed $1 trillion in Q4 2023. 35% of Americans have maxed out their cards. 85% of those with maxed out cards cite inflation and higher prices as the primary driver. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Rick Diamond/Getty Images) Financial advice radio program host Dave Ramsey usually gets callers with specific questions on their personal situations. However, among general topics, one that has come up is the different mindset that separates the rich from the poor. Ramsey noted that the major question that a rich person asks when posed with a proposition is: “How much?” Conversely, Ramsey says that a poor person will ask: “How much down payment?” The implication is that rich people don’t spend beyond their means, while poor people habitually overspend themselves into debt scenarios. They purchase based on whether or not they can afford the down payment, without consideration about how high interest rates, sudden emergencies, a loss of employment or a pay cut can impact the ability to maintain payments, not to mention the higher total net cost when the interest is added on. According to Debt.com, 1 in 3 Americans have maxed out their credit cards. According to Business Insider, the average American is $104,215 in debt, inclusive of mortgage, credit cards, auto loans, and student loans. The yoke of debt around American taxpayers’ necks grows continually larger; the national debt is presently increasing by $1 trillion every fiscal quarter. There is absolutely no question that the debt and credit business is huge. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) stock, at the time of this writing, is currently 4 points shy of its 52-week high of $296.34, and Barclays has just announced its 12-month target for Visa is $347.00. Rival MasterCard (MYSE: MA) is trading at $506 and has an analyst consensus 12-month target price of $544.36. Credit card balances exceeded the $1 trillion milestone in Q4 2023. A Debt.com report cited the following statistics among American respondents: Survey data from NerdWallet Ramsey’s fundamental advice is essentially, “Don’t buy it if you can’t afford it.” Sadly, the omnipresence of 24/7 marketing in our social media, emails, television viewing, and even in reading newspapers and magazines, makes this advice even more difficult now than in bygone days. Given that inflation is still a threat that is lurking around the corner to jump higher yet again, cutting credit cards that may be needed in emergencies is not a practical option in the current economic climate.

By WND Staff December 12, 2025 America is pushing its own workers out of the economy, and almost no one in power will say it out loud. James Fishback joins Elizabeth Farah days after launching his campaign for Florida governor to explain how visa programs, hedge funds, and AI expansion are dismantling jobs, homeownership, and family life. Fishback points to hard numbers and concrete policies. Only 15 percent of 30-year-old men now own a home. Corporations legally replace American graduates with H-1B visa labor. BlackRock and Blackstone outbid families for single-family homes and turn neighborhoods into rentals. Airbnb replaces neighbors with weekend tourists. AI data centers drive up electricity costs while threatening local water supplies. Elizabeth presses Fishback on what this actually looks like on the ground. Young Americans delay marriage because they cannot afford a home. Families lose bidding wars to hedge funds. College graduates train their foreign replacements. Communities hollow out as housing becomes a balance-sheet asset instead of a place to raise children. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Fishback argues this did not happen by accident. Republicans and Democrats approved the visa programs, protected corporate buyers, and shifted the costs onto working families. He lays out why states do not have to accept this arrangement, and why Florida could become the first test case for blocking labor replacement, taxing corporate home hoarding, and stopping AI projects that raise utility bills. This is a blunt, unsanitized conversation about who the American economy now serves, who it leaves behind, and why restoring jobs, housing, and sovereignty may start at the state level.

Title: How YouTube Ate Podcasts and TV

Short-form video is taking over everything (including reading). Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel turns the camera on himself to ask a simple question: Why are you seeing his face? Using YouTube’s takeover of podcasts as a starting point, he explores how video has devoured audio and turned podcasts into something closer to daytime TV and late-night talk shows. NPR’s Rachel Martin, host of the celebrity-interview show Wild Card, joins to talk about her own shift from intimate, audio-only conversations to highly visible video chats with mega-celebrities. She explains how the visual layer changes everything—from building trust with guests and audiences to deepening parasocial relationships, and why showing your face is necessary in a low-trust media world. To trace the business and cultural arc of this pivot, Bloomberg reporter Ashley Carman explains the rise and fall of the podcast “gold rush”—from the Serial era to Spotify’s billion-dollar bet, to the collapse of expensive narrative audio and YouTube’s emergence as a true power player. Then, writer and Plain English host Derek Thompson joins to explain his theory that “everything is television now.” Warzel and Thompson explore how short-form video, autoplay feeds, and video podcasts are reshaping our attention, our politics, and even our sense of self—turning podcasts into background “wallpaper” while nudging more of us into broadcasting our lives. Together, the conversations sketch a weird, slightly berserk future where video podcasts aren’t just a format—they’re a window into a lonelier, more fragmented, video-first culture. The following is a transcript of the episode: Derek Thompson: Do you actually need to sit still by yourself and listen to your thoughts, ever? Like, is that good for you at all? Should you just always choose to, like, download other people’s thoughts inside of your brain so you’re never stuck with the sort of, you know, subvocal questions of your own consciousness? I feel honest about this, because I’m not sure that these are, like, familiar feelings. I feel like we’re sort of being thrust into, again, a kind of really unnatural experiment based on these technologies. And, you know, given the changes in mental health over the last few decades, it’s not entirely clear to me that surrounding ourselves with the constant … bombarding ourselves with the constant thoughts for the people is particularly good for our sanity. [Music] Charlie Warzel: Hello, and welcome to Galaxy Brain. I’m Charlie Warzel. And if you’re watching this on YouTube, welcome to my face—and apologies for my face, which is actually the subject of today’s show. Why are you seeing my face, or, perhaps more appropriately, why did YouTube devour podcasting? So as a technology reporter, one thing that I absolutely love is just being an internet crash-test dummy, right there. I think that there’s no better way to understand a platform than to try to make things and share things on them. So part of my reporting has always been to try to lean into riding the algorithmic waves myself and just watching what happens, right? That’s a big reason why we launched Galaxy Brain as a video podcast. There’s all these questions that I have. Like, you know, how do YouTube thumbnails and titles change the way that a video performs? What happens when you make something evergreen versus something newsy? How valuable is a celebrity to having your video go viral? Ultimately, who’s watching these things, right? I feel like there’s just no better way to really understand what is happening online than to do things online. And so that’s just one very small reason why you’re seeing my face, right? But it’s not just me. There’s just a lot of people in media and journalism who were previously scribes or just audio podcasters, right, who’ve become YouTubers or TikTokers. And so you could say that this is just like pivoting to video, right? Back in the 2010s, there was this sort of infamous “pivot to video,” mostly caused by people responding to incentives on Facebook. And it was mostly disastrous for people. As a digital-media survivor of the 2010s, I had to endure that. And I think that what’s happening now, though, is different. I think it’s much less responsive to the whims of these platforms, and I think it’s a lot more driven by audiences. It’s also a lot more popular. In late 2024, this research firm, Edison Research, said that “YouTube has risen to the top as the most popular service used for podcast listening in the United States. Thirty-one percent of weekly podcast listeners 13 and up choose YouTube as the service that they use to listen to it.” That’s well surpassed Spotify, which is at 27 percent, and Apple Podcasts, which is at 15 percent. They also said that “84 percent of Gen Z monthly podcast listeners listen or watch podcasts with a video component.” And so it’s very popular to be a YouTuber with a podcast. This trend has been moving pretty steadily since about 2019, and that’s when some popular podcasts started posting to YouTube and seeing some success with these short clippings. They were called YouTube Shorts. And this was getting a lot of traction in YouTube’s algorithm, but it’s booming now. This past October, Spotify announced that a bunch of their popular podcasts from The Ringer, like the Bill Simmons show—they’re all going to be streaming on Netflix. And so, essentially, what you have is podcasts that are behaving like normal television. There’s been a whole bunch of weird sort of externalities that have come out of this. Recently, Bloomberg reported on this outgrowth of this video-podcasting boom, and one thing that’s happened is the rise of clippers. So these are people that capture the best moments from various videos online, and they seed them across social media. Really big YouTubers like Mr. Beast have hired them to do work for them, and they pay about $50 for every hundred thousand views. You’ve also got record labels that are employing clippers to take miscellaneous video footage and pair it with artists’ songs on places like TikTok. In this weird way, this is this convergence of all media into one big blob of short-form video content, right? I think that all of this is just changing consumption behaviors. I hear this from a bunch of people in my life, who—they come home, and they turn on YouTube, and they stream podcasts while they do other things. They do it from their TV. And so it seems like podcasts have moved from, like, not even a second-screen experience, right? It’s like a one-and-a-half-screen experience. And so I think that there’s something here. I think that the shift tells us quite a bit about the way that people are moving away from the medium of text and toward basically anything that’s similar to short-form video content. Anything that can be clipped, edited, picked apart, put on social media to go viral. And I think that all this has a lot to do with our attention spans, but also the parasocial relationships that people are developing with people who used to be in their ears a whole bunch of hours a week. Right? People are interested in seeing these creators inside and out, including their workspaces. And, apologies again. I think that this change has something to tell us about our culture and our technology, and I think it can maybe even help explain other anecdotal trends—like these concerns that people aren’t reading as much as they used to. This is a big, sprawling, really interesting topic. And to tackle it, I’ve assembled what I think is a murderer’s row of guests: people who work as video podcasters, analysts in the podcast space, and media thinkers that I’ve admired for quite a while. So today, we’re going to figure out why you’re seeing my face. My first guest is NPR’s Rachel Martin: the host of the popular celebrity-interview show called Wild Card. And by now, a video-podcast pro. Rachel, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thank you for being a guinea pig in this experiment of ours. Rachel Martin: Thank you for having me. I’m so happy to be here. Warzel: So I wanted to do this thing like an episode, and the title is kind of like, “Why Are You Seeing My Face?” Because the question I don’t understand, as, like, a face for blogging, you know, throughout my career. It seems like journalists are just increasingly becoming YouTubers, and YouTubers are increasingly trying to become podcasters, and there’s this sort of like—everyone’s meeting in the middle, right? But you are somebody who has been working in the audio space for a really long time. Has, you know, worked at that craft, and had this really close long-term relationship with an audience through a specific medium. Martin: Right. Warzel: You are also—you’ve moved into, you know, the video space, the YouTube space. You are interacting with, like, mega-celebrities all the time on video. You’re hosting a talk show. Martin: Yeah. Warzel: I guess, what has that experience been like for you? Going from this, you know, very sort of intimate “ear medium” to this visual one? Martin: I have so much to say on this topic, Charlie. Warzel: Good, good, good, good. Martin: And so you can direct me in any, in any particular path, conversationally. But I mean, I love audio. I should just say I still am completely in love with the intimacy of audio. That’s why I went into it. I worked in television news for a couple of years and intentionally left that job to go back to radio. Because I think it’s such a special medium. There’s just nothing like it. And to not have any distractions from anything else; it’s just you and that person and the sound of their voice. And anybody can insert themselves into that conversation, like, you know, a little fly on the wall. And it’s such a beautiful, beautiful experience. And I spent decades doing this work. So now, I do this thing as, as you said—now I have a podcast. But podcasts now are not just audio experiences; they’re video experiences. And I didn’t do this reluctantly. When we came up with this idea, my team and I wanted it to have a visual component, because the conceit that we had for the show, it’s with cards, these conversation cards. And it’s more fun. It’s interactive in a way that really lends itself to the medium of video. But it does—it changes the experience, you know? It is no longer just me and the sound of that person’s voice as the only input. There’s lots of inputs now. But I have come, Charlie, to love the inputs. There’s so many more things to play with in the sandbox of conversation, you know? Warzel: So like, what is one of those things that you have found that is kind of delightful in it? Because there is the part of it that’s like, Okay, I have to look a certain way, be worried about how I’m addressing whatever, the lights— Martin: Yeah that part’s annoying Warzel: It’s backlit, like all that. Put makeup— Martin: Now, I don’t wear my pajamas, and I have to like, you know, try. I have to try, but maybe I should do that anyway. But, I mean, now I get to see you smile. Right now I get to see you be amused. I get to watch someone’s body language as they think through something. And especially for our show, there’s these big, deep questions. And they demand a lot of thoughtfulness. And I love watching someone absorb the question that I’ve asked. And so there’s just so—there are so many more ingredients to the conversation, and I find it to be really exciting. It’s just different for me, and I have more to play with. It can feel chaotic sometimes. I’m like—oh, if I were just listening to the sound of someone’s voice, you know, I wouldn’t be paying attention to their body language. Or I wouldn’t be paying attention to like, some kind of tick that they had that they kept doing. Or the way they were tapping their foot during an answer because the question made them nervous. But now all those inputs shape how I respond as a listener. When you’re working in audio, you’re just listening so intently, right? But now my aperture is just so much wider. I can see how someone is responding to a question or thinking through it in such a richer way. And I honestly do feel like it leads to better conversations. I did not use to think this. You know, Terry Gross, Fresh Air: She had this rule; I think she still has it. She just does all her interviews remotely, because she doesn’t want the distraction, and she believes it’s far more intimate to just have a voice with a voice. But I’m also trying to get people to trust me. And I think that being able to see another person’s face—you become more human to them, and then maybe you will trust me a little more with your stories. And I think that comes more readily when you see someone, the person interviewing you. I think it helps to see them, instead of just having this like authoritative “voice of God” kind of thing in your head. Warzel: I think that’s so important too. Because it’s funny—we’ve done probably, like, four different interviews for this show so far. And almost every one of them has gotten back to this idea somehow of trust, right? Like, I’m very interested in mediums and the attention economy. And the way that, you know, the medium changes, and it changes us too. And this idea of, we’re all, I think in the media grappling with this notion that that trust in these institutions is lower now. And this idea of finding ways to build it—but also finding ways to build it that aren’t shallow or that aren’t pandering. Or that aren’t, you know, having to capitulate on your own values in some kind of way. And I think you’re totally right that there is—not only in an interview, you know, between you and the interviewee, but also in terms of an audience. Like, have you noticed that the relationship to the audience, the feedback you’ve gotten, has that relationship changed? Do you feel like there’s a, a different valence to it, a different kind of trust there? Martin: The trust is so broken that the further we can pull back the veil—and the more people can trust the curators of their news and information, and their podcasts, even though mine is not a news podcast anymore—I think it’s necessary. I think that’s the way forward. And so, it feels uncomfortable for a lot of people, especially in news spaces, and journalists in general. Like, I’m not the story. I don’t wanna put myself in it. I think that ship has sailed. I think that people need to understand and trust the storyteller in a way that we never had to prove before. And I think putting yourself out there—literally, in your face—is one step toward that. Warzel: Yeah. I think sometimes there are times when I have done, in my career, like Q&As with people, right? And they’re always cleaned up—in the sense of, you know, just my rambling is a little less rambly. Their answers are maybe a little more succinct. We get to the meat and potatoes of it, and everyone looks like the most, you know, concise, professional version of themselves. Martin: Best version of themselves. Warzel: Phenomenal. Martin: And not real. Warzel: And not real. Right. And I think about, sometimes … you know, what I am excited about for a medium like this, what I think is exciting to watch, is watching us. As the people who are doing the newsgathering, or whatever you’re calling it—the interviewing, the presentation—struggling with these feelings, and struggling with our own things. Not in a way where we’re failing, but in trying to grasp it. And I think that it’s such a more human thing. One thing I’m absolutely curious about is: Have you noticed people forming more interesting parasocial relationships with you? Like, have you kind of gotten that sense of Wow, this person thinks they kind of know all of me, even though they know a side of me? Martin: Yeah. I mean, again, I end up revealing really personal things on my show. You know, my relationship with grief, and my parents died. And my relationship with my siblings and my insecurities. It’s ripe for that kind of parasocial relationship. So I sort of knew that that was going to be baked into the sauce here. But that’s what we want. I mean, I don’t want people showing up at my house and thinking, you know, that we’re best friends. But the whole point in growing audience—and really how you do it—is for your audience to feel like they do know you in a way that differentiates the relationship from other podcast hosts or curators of their news and information. So, I like it. I dig it. I’m into it. And I try to get into the comments and try to respond to people and reply to their emails. Because it’s a lonely world, and this is a way that people can feel connected to each other. And our show in particular was designed with that in mind. [Music] Warzel: Okay. So talking to Rachel, I kept thinking back to 2024. And the way that podcasts were playing this really important role in the media strategy around the presidential election. Recently in New York magazine, the reporter Nick Quah wrote that we are “still living in the long tail of last year’s podcast election, when audio and video shows became full-fledged political battlegrounds for messaging.” He makes a good argument, I think. Former podcasters are now running government agencies, and the biggest political and cultural fights are taking place in long, protracted discussions on niche podcasts held by influencers and former media personalities. Especially on the right, you’ve got Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly, who’ve taken their big platforms from cable news and moved them to podcast land. And Quah argues that—from the left’s growing power to the right’s fractures—podcasting is where arguments are shaped, tested, and turned into movements. Almost all of these are video podcasts. And so Rachel’s point, I think, is about the way that this format’s really ripe for these parasocial relationships. I think that that is absolutely key to all of this. Because in this moment of waning trust, podcasters are showing more of themselves to people, for longer. Sometimes hours a day, five days a week. And people are starting to feel like they know these hosts. And importantly, they trust them. But that doesn’t explain everything, right? Some of this is structural. Some of this is responding to business incentives. And that’s why I asked Ashley Carman, who covers the business of podcasting for Bloomberg, how we got here. [Music] Warzel: Ashley, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thank you for coming on. Ashley Carman: Yeah; thanks for having me. Warzel: So you cover the podcast space, the media space, for Bloomberg and have done so much great reporting. Kind of contextualizing the different shifts in the areas we’re in. Pivoting to video, not pivoting to video, you know. YouTubers starting podcasts, podcasters starting YouTube pages. Can you kind of describe to me a little bit the arc of how we got here? You know, I think we sort of have the kicking off with, like, the Serial age. But how do you see it in terms of the arc of where podcasts have gone in the last, like, seven to 10 years, in a speedrun kind of fashion? Carman: Yeah, we could definitely do this speedrun style. So yeah, starting with the Serial era, I think this was kind of the moment that people generally realized that podcasts could become a mainstream format. If you already were a public-radio fan, you’ve probably been listening to long-form audio at this point for some time. But Serial really captured the audiences in a podcast format, and so this was this moment where it became watercooler talk. Seemingly everyone you knew was obsessed with Serial. It was parodied on SNL. So it really became a cultural moment. And that’s when I think some agents started to pay attention to the space. That’s when other companies started to pay attention to the space. And Spotify, you know, soon thereafter started to dip a toe into their own kind of podcast experiments. In 2019, that’s really when we started to see major deals, and that’s when podcasting kind of popped from a like, Oh my God, there’s a business happening here, and the biggest tech platforms in the world care about this. So everyone got into the space, including Spotify, Amazon. SiriusXM, of course, was a satellite-radio company, but they started doing big podcast deals. Audible, you know, was already doing audiobooks, but they started to do their own podcast endeavors as well, also under the Amazon umbrella. And really, you just saw this focus from a probably audio-service focus that then started to care about on-demand podcasts. And then, you know—I think there’s that meme that’s like the trough of disillusionment. Warzel: Sure. Carman: And that kind of happens starting around 2022. You had all these tech platforms flood into the space, expecting to make significant returns on the investments they had in podcasting. And for context, Spotify spent over a billion dollars on podcasts. So they expected some seriously high returns. And it just didn’t pan out, really. I think there’s a few reasons for that we can dive into, but just podcasting as a whole, like the revenue side of it, didn’t pan out in the way they thought. And so there were a ton of layoffs. But then, where there started to be green shoots was YouTube. And it was kind of the sleeping giant—which I feel like has happened with YouTube, basically in every creative industry. Where all of a sudden YouTube itself also realized, during COVID, Hey, people are watching podcasts on our service, and maybe we should kind of focus on that. And they started to put money into it. They started to put product efforts into it. And really in the span of like three years, they became the top podcast platform in the U.S., according to Edison Research. So now podcasting is in this place where it’s really synonymous with the creator economy. And so you have YouTubers who are starting podcasts. Podcasters who are becoming YouTubers. And it’s really just becoming this sort of influencer world, where the biggest stars are doing live tours. They’re releasing books; they have merch lines. They’re kind of building 360 businesses around themselves. And even the audio brands that maybe don’t have that one star talent, and they’re not a Top 50 show themselves, are also trying to find audiences on video, because the algorithms there are just so strong. So that’s kind of how we got to this point. Warzel: So is part of the YouTube thing, I think—YouTube’s so interesting, right? Because it is, as you put it, it’s this, like, sleeping giant. It’s been massive for so long. It’s been this, you know, big revenue creator through ads for so many different people. It’s also this massive, massive cultural ecosystem, that people are spending unfathomable amounts of time there. And yet, if you’re like an executive or someone who’s not of that world, it might not be something that you know to go to. Right. And so I feel like YouTube kind of comes for everyone there. But my question to you: Is the reason for this pivot that just, like, you don’t need a ton of overhead? You don’t need, you know, this big investment. And YouTube sort of gives you this access to this massive audience, where you can then sell a lot of ads and then make a lot of money. Like, is that the reason for the YouTube pivot? Carman: I actually think that that’s in the “cons” category. Warzel: Oh, really? Carman: Because audio is so much cheaper to make. You don’t have to hire video editors; you don’t have to learn to edit video. I mean, part of being in video is doing clips. People are spending money on clippers. I mean, that’s like a whole economy in itself. So it’s actually more expensive to have a video operation. But the thing that video offers is these algorithms. And I think when Spotify first got into the space, podcasters—like traditional podcasters in the audio world—were really excited, because Spotify was the one behind Discover Weekly. So people thought, Well, they’re going to be able to do what they did for music, but for podcasts. They’re actually going to make it so it’s easier to discover shows, and it won’t just be word-of-mouth. That didn’t really end up panning out. And what people found instead was that if we have video clips on TikTok, or reels now—or if we’re just on YouTube—those services are amazing at showing you the content you want to see. And that includes podcasts. Whether we would’ve thought of them as podcasts to begin with in the first place is a whole different question. But that’s why they really started to turn to video. Warzel: Is there more to that? Because I think actually like from the layperson, there’s this, you know—people pivoted from all their bespoke podcast apps. And a lot of people are listening to their podcasts now on something like Spotify. And I think there’s this sense that actually, like, it did work out. Maybe not from an industry standpoint. But like, can you walk me through a little, just beyond the discovery mechanism? What were some of the other reasons that it just didn’t go the way that they thought it would? Carman: Well, audio can be cheap to make. But if you’re doing narrative series that require reporters essentially going on assignment for weeks, months, at a time—it’s very well-thought-out and a long project that’s expensive to make. And one of the studios that Spotify was working with, and acquired, was Gimlet Studios. And they were known for these really gorgeous, long-form shows. I think at some point they were kind of dubbed “the HBO of podcasting.” And that’s where the economics, I think, became more difficult. So you had these chat shows, that I think now are what’s known in the business. And everyone, when they think of a podcast, probably thinks of a chat show. But there is this whole other strain of podcasting. That again, coming out of the public-radio world, was kind of what podcasting was. I mean, this is Serial. It’s narrative. It takes a long time. It’s gorgeously edited; it requires on-the-ground reporting. And that’s not cheap to make. So I think people were looking maybe at a different format that didn’t end up panning out. And those shows still exist, but it’s just not going to be the biggest moneymaker in the world, comparatively at least. Warzel: You know, I think when we think about this move toward video, especially in this space. And also sort of like the move where like, you know, I’ve noticed the thing—a lot of people have pointed out, on TikTok, where folks sort of set up their situation to make it look like they’re conducting a podcast. Like, they have a podcast—and they don’t even have one. Carman: The fake podcasts. Charlie: The fake podcast. That, to me, is wild. And such a fascinating little, like, growth hack or whatever. But I’m curious—this is obviously, people say “the pivot to video.” And that is very—there’s a lot of baggage with that phrase, right? Like I worked at at Buzzfeed in the 2010s. Like, I know about these dreaded “everyone moves and pivots to video.” And then the platforms change what they care about, how they wanna do things. And everyone’s left holding the bag. This feels different to me, right? This feels, to me, a little more sustainable. How does it feel to you? Does this feel like a trend or a fad? Or is this an actual sort of, like, more of a reliable shift in consumer behavior and the way that we’re making things? Carman: So there’s two sides to this. The YouTube side of—people love to get into the debate of, like, Are people watching, or are they just having it on in the background? Like, are they really watching the video? And we could talk about that. But generally speaking, are people using YouTube to consume podcasts? Yeah, just generally. I think that’s here to stay. I think that’s a thing. Yes. Do I think podcasters are influencers and can drive purchasing decisions, and belong within that broader creator economy? Yes. Now, where I would say it’s a little murkier is—and we haven’t really talked about this part of the pivot to video—but there’s been a pivot to video in the sense that either traditional media, like a Fox News, for example, or CNN, as well as streamers like a Netflix, or a Tubi, are looking at podcasts as programming that they can put on their airwaves. Basically. And so I think the question for that is: Do people want to watch a podcast on Netflix? Or do people wanna stick around on Hulu and watch the companion podcast to Dancing With the Stars? Those are the questions where I think that user behavior is still a little bit—I’m not sure. But that’s … again, it’s so nascent. This is just starting out, truly, within the past year. Within the past months, even. Warzel: You spoke earlier about—we can get into this about whether, you know, people are watching these things like second screen, first screen. Like, I am a little curious in what you’re hearing about the cultural bit of this. To me it feels like some of this video-podcasting boom has to do a little bit with the intensity of the parasocial relationship between a lot of these creators or podcasters or journalists or whoever. Right. The idea of like, Hey, I wanna see what their room looks like. I need to know what they look like, how they say these things, what their, you know, gestures are, and facial features. And all that jazz. I’m curious. Like, is this pivot, some of it, just because—like you said—the YouTube algorithm’s really good for this? There’s a lot of money to be made there. Like, I guess how important is the video component of this? Like, are you getting the sense that people are really watching and engaging with it in that way? Or is it kind of like—it is just the second-screen content for the most part? And it just so happens to be on this bigger platform? Carman: I do think video’s important. And because, again, going back to kind of the beginning of podcasting. Journalists, maybe guests you didn’t know about. Podcasting is now sort of a substitute for daytime TV and late-night TV. And so, you have celebrities not only hosting these shows, but coming on as guests quite frequently, as part of the PR strategy to go on podcasts now. [Music] Warzel: So I think that Ashley is just dead-on here. This idea that podcasts have essentially become a replacement for daytime TV and also late night on video. You’ve got these celebrities and these interesting public figures and documentaries and news, and it’s all mashed up into usually lower-production-value versions of cable news and late-night formats. And, a lot like regular TV, the shows just autoplay one after another. There’s always something on next. Except this time, it’s ostensibly tailored to your interests. I think that the daytime-TV cable replacement is borne out by a lot of the data, too. YouTube just keeps growing. That is in part because some of the biggest consumers of daytime TV are going to Netflix to watch this content on their TV during the day. Nielsen data from this year shows that adults 65 and up nearly doubled their YouTube viewing on TV over the last two years. This is the group of people who are traditionally at home, have a lot of time on their hands. And they’ve discovered YouTube and are going to it. But this TV-ification of podcasts, I don’t think is a unique phenomenon. In fact, I think that the gravitational pull of media seems to be pushing everything into this similar short-formed video. It’s this idea that my former colleague and podcaster Derek Thompson has written about recently. His take is that everything is television now. That that might actually have a lot to say about our fragmented and even lonely culture. I brought him on to talk about it. [Music] Warzel: Derek Thompson, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thompson: Great to be here, man. Thank you. Warzel: So you wrote a piece not too long ago that, in very classic Derek form, takes like a bunch of different disparate thoughts and puts them into sort of a grand theory of culture and attention. That theory is that everything is television. I’m just curious. At the outset, like, what got you started on this? Because this feels like this is one of those that, like, comes about after it’s been kind of ruminating in the back of the brain. And you’re just, like, gathering examples and data for a long time. But how—what’s the spark, the genesis for this? Thompson: I think you pretty much nailed it. You know, Charlie, it’s almost as if you and I do more or less the same thing for a living, that you read this article and understood its germination. Precisely. I mean, it really did start with—I host a podcast with the Ringer Podcast Network, which is owned by Spotify, called Plain English. And the Ringer is moving a lot of their podcasts to video. And first they were moving it to YouTube, and now they recently signed a contract with Netflix that some of their podcasts are being moved to Netflix. And so they came to me and they said, We wanna make plain-English, essentially a YouTube show, slash, eventually maybe a Netflix show. I got into podcasting precisely because it wasn’t television. I like listening to podcasts, not watching them. I listen to podcasts when I go on a walk with my dog. I listen to podcasts when I’m making coffee. I listen to podcasts when I’m commuting to work. I love that I can do something else that it only occupies one sensory stream and doesn’t command all of the sensory streams. I don’t need to touch it. I don’t need to taste it. Warzel: Preach. Thompson: I just need to listen to it. And so my initial response was like, “No, I don’t wanna do that; Plain English is a podcast. I don’t want it to be television.” And then they, you know, suggested that I look at some of the data. And the data very clearly showed that video podcasts, including on Spotify, are growing something like 20 times faster than non-video podcasts. And to the extent that I, Derek, am in the business of trying to get the software of my ideas running on the hardware of other people’s brains as efficiently as possible, it makes no freaking sense for me to not make this show a television show. And so I was thinking about that, and being like kind of mad about it. Because I’m eventually just going to, you know, make it a video show. And then I read this FTC report where Meta, in a case that was ultimately successful against the FTC, the FTC says: Meta, you’re a monopoly. Meta says, No we’re not. And in one filing to prove that Meta was not a monopoly, in this lawsuit, they said, Look, we’re not a social-media monopoly because we’re not a social-media company. The vast, vast majority of the videos that people watch aren’t from their friends at all. They’re from random strangers that are essentially making videos that are basically like short-form television. So here Meta is, with their back against the wall, telling the U.S. government: We’re not a social-media company; we’re television. And I was like, Oh, this is a story. And now I just need to find a third thing. And then that third thing was Sora 2 and Vibes, the Facebook equivalent of Sora 2, which is an AI platform. Essentially you have these people who are working on, like, the ultimate creation. Like they’re trying to invent God. They’re trying to invent a silicon brain that is smarter than any human brain at everything. And on the way to inventing God, they’re like, Oh, let’s essentially build a TikTok, but for AI-generated videos. Which is essentially just more short-form video on our phones; it’s more TV. And so, tic-tac-toe. I put those things together—and I was like, I’m just going to write that everything is becoming television, and hopefully, having a ride at that theory, backfill it with a lot of other research that I’ll do. So that’s what I did. I said, “Everything is television.” And then the rest of the article sort of flowed from there. Warzel: I can sympathize with that completely. Hey. I feel like, you know, I had a conversation with somebody, a political-science professor who I was talking to a couple years ago, who actually like, scared the crap outta me. Because they, they were like, Listen, man, I hang out with young people. And, like, no one’s ever going to read again. Truly, it was one of the reasons I left The New York Times. I was just so rattled by this thing. I was like, I need to start a Substack; like now. You know, like be someplace different. Of course, you know, retreating into words. But, you know, one of the things that they were mentioning to me, and it wasn’t really like “everything was television.” But it was like: Go take a look at, like, how kids are expressing themselves. Or like kids, younger people, are expressing themselves on TikTok. And it was like, every single one of them is doing a Jon Stewart or a Tucker Carlson, or, you know, a John Oliver–style impression. Like delivering a monologue to camera, and there’s like a screen grab of, you know, like a tweet or something that they’re talking about, that’s right there. Yeah. And I mean, you know, now you have obviously influencers with, like, the fake cable-news chirons underneath their YouTube videos and stuff. But it felt, too, like not only was the form changing in terms of you know, short-form video movement and popularity. But it was also like, people were legitimately aping the style. Thompson: It’s like they grew up on. It’s a little bit like: So I have a two-year-old, and one of the first games that she loved to play is I’m a monster and she’s prey. So I pretend to be a monster, and she pretends to run away from me. And I have all sorts of stupid evolutionary-psychology reasons about why parents have it somehow ingrained in them to pretend to be monsters—to teach our children to run away from danger. That’s not what this is about, though. It’s about: Eventually she turned two, and now she likes to be the monster, and I’m the prey. Right? And so, like, this is essentially what’s happening, but with television. It’s like these people who grew up basking in the glow of John Oliver and, you know, The Daily Show, are like: Okay, well, now I’m starting to walk on my two feet, and I’m just going to, like, make that exact same thing, but using TikTok. And so this is how I think, you know, the post-literate world sort of feeds on itself, right? People who are brought up in television want to express themselves in television. Which means the next microgeneration grows up watching those people express themselves in television and think, Oh, you know, image and video and straight-to-camera charisma; it’s just the way you communicate big ideas. And so that’s why, you know, a big part of me wonders whether the era of reading, like the literate world, might have just been this little tiny bubble that existed in human history. And we’re just going right back to just … we’re all oral apes, and television is just going to be everything. Warzel: Do you get that sense? Do you feel like it will continue to like contract into a smaller, more granular form? We talk so much about short-form video content being, like, a primary way people are expressing themselves. A primary way people who are younger, especially, want to consume media. And yet also, like these podcasts are like usually pretty long too, right? Like, the form seems to be pretty elastic in that way. Do you feel like time matters much in all this? Thompson: So I think that culture is always strange, and it’s always backlashing on itself. Which means you often have barbell effects. For example, in music in the 2010s. I remember as streaming was taking off, vinyl was taking off as well. Now it wasn’t taking off the same way it took off in like the 1940s, 1950s, but vinyl sales were growing a lot. And so sometimes what you have is: One trend becomes so obvious that there becomes a cultural backlash to it, and then that feeds another sort of coexisting trend. So one could tell a story. Like if I was going to report out a sort of second “Everything is television, part two” essay, one could tell a story that says, Well everything is becoming television with TikTok and with reels and with AI and with YouTube podcasts—but also Substack is big, and more people are reading. Like, you know, if you look at the people reading with The New York Times and The Atlantic, there’s lots of folks who—and maybe even a growing number of people—who are reading text. I just think that there’s something to this notion that television—and by television, here, I’m really relying on Raymond Williams, who wrote a 1974 book called Television Technology and Cultural Form, where he said, television, to him, meant a continuous flow of episodic video. And so in a way, based on that 1974 definition, TikTok and reels are even more television than television. Right? Continuous flow of episodic video. I do think there’s something to this idea that there’s an attractor state in media, such that many different enterprises and many different motivations become television. So Facebook began as a student directory. It became television. AI started trying to create superintelligence. They became television. I wanted to just make a radio show. I became television. Charlie just wants to write words in paragraphs— Warzel: That’s all I want. Thompson: Like, leave him alone. Just let the man write words in paragraphs. What are we doing right now? We’re talking on Riverside, where I can see your face, and you can see my face, because I’m assuming this is a podcast. That we will eventually have some video component, and maybe more people will watch it as TV than listen to it as a podcast. So there is something to this idea that television is an attractor state. And no matter where you begin in your media journey—A) I wanna make a student directory; B) I just want make a superintelligence; C) I just want to make radio for the internet—you end up in TV. Because that’s just where the eyeballs flow. So I’m always willing to hear a backlash argument and be there for the idea that, like, not everything becomes one thing in a messy culture. But man, it really does seem like everything wants to become television. Warzel: You know, to this point—you wrote that you talked about the format of it and the idea of all of this flow. All of this, you know, volume of television that we have. Or, you know, video-based media. And something that I really liked that you wrote was that television’s not really meant to absorb our attention as much as maybe, like—you know, scratch away at it. Or I think you said “dab away at it.” Thompson: Dab away at it. Warzel: Right. But the idea that there is this sort of—I mean, this is the idea of the second screen, right? This is the idea of sort of creating things that make someone feel comfortable, or that there’s something on in the room that there’s presence. Or whatnot. And I think that’s really interesting. I had—before you, I was talking to Ashley Carman, who, you know, writes about all of this stuff and reports on the podcasting industry for Bloomberg. And her takeaway from all of this is like, yeah, podcasts are becoming daytime-TV now, right? Like, you don’t really turn on Ellen; you don’t have this thing you just throw on whatever. And, you know, Derek’s there. It is just sort of like—we don’t have to pay these people; you know, we don’t have to get these nice sets and have the studio audience clapping and do all that stuff. And all that overhead. We can just have, you know, face-for-radio Charlie, talking to you. And have it on in the background. And YouTube serves the greatest function that it can serve. There is the recommendation engine and the autoplay. Right? And I just wonder—I mean, how do you think we make media in that world to be part of, like, a autoplay carousel? It feels very disjointed and almost a little bit sad. Thompson: Yeah. Uh, there’s so many thoughts that I had as you were saying that; I wanna make sure that I, like, find a way to sort of put them all on. Warzel: I don’t ask concise questions. Thompson: I’m trying to, like, put all those gemstones in one necklace essentially. Okay. So people sometimes talk about, like, “lean-forward media” versus “lean-back media.” And maybe that’s the wrong dichotomy. Like, lean-forward versus lean-back, I think, speaks this idea that, like … when I’m reading a hard novel, I’m leaning forward. And when I’m watching stupid television, I’m leaning back. But now that there’s so much television—and by television I mean there’s TV on our phones, there’s TV on iPads, there’s TV on our actual TV. In a way, we don’t really pay that close attention to a lot of the television that’s playing around us. We kind of soak in it, right? It’s like, you turn on Netflix. And I don’t know if my wife’s going to be listening to this, but I hope I’m not burning her too bad. Sometimes it’ll happen with my wife, and we’ll talk about a show we really want to watch; a movie we really want to watch. And we’ll turn it on, and then we’ll immediately recognize that one or the other one has picked up their phone. Just look at their phone within like three minutes. It’s like, I thought you really wanted to watch this. And it’s like—I do, but “watch” doesn’t mean watch. Right, “watch” means, like, have it on. And I wonder whether what’s happening to media is: People almost don’t know how to be alone without it. We need something to be churning on in the background. We need something to be sort of like swimming in, media-wise. Otherwise we feel almost too alone with ourselves. I mean, I’ll sometimes feel this about podcasts. I could be walking down the street, and I’ll be like, Wow; I’m just listening to myself think. Maybe I should put on Bill Simmons. Right. And it’s easier now, I think, especially when you’re sitting down at home or at work or in a bedroom to just put on lots of media. And just have it, like, basking around you, surrounding you. And that does create a weird world where no one’s fully watching any particular thing. And Netflix has clearly responded to this. I thought it was amazing: In my reporting, there was an essay that was written by Will Lan. We reported that screenwriters working for Netflix have sometimes heard a note from company executives for their television shows—that the characters have to announce what they’re doing so that viewers of the program who just have it on the background can follow along. Because otherwise, like, complex plots are just too much. Because no one’s paying attention on a second-to-second basis. And so I just think there’s something to this idea that—as everything becomes television and no one can fully pay attention to any one thing for a really long period of time—it all just becomes different kinds of wallpaper for us. And that’s a very strange, I think, phenomenon. Warzel: Yeah. Do you think it’s … this is just a very sort of personal, your journalistic-philosophy-type thing. How much do you try to lean out of that? Right? Because I think—you know, what you said before at the very outset of this. The software of your ideas into, like, the hardware of other people in the world, right? And so I’m just—I’m curious how you think about that. Because there’s a way in which it’s so disenchanting to hear. You know, like it’s all wallpaper. And like, I guess like the media version of trying to announce what the plot is, is like just bashing people over the head with very blunt, sort of, maybe dumbed-down ideas. I’m just curious: Like, how much do you think about having to chase that idea and sort of embrace this notion of: I’m going to get the audience wherever, wherever I can, however I can. Versus that sort of hard … like the work that usually comes through in the text, right? Which is like footnotes and citing and block quotes. And the, you know, real kind of granular data. How do you parse that yourself? Thompson: Yeah. I mean, you’re scratching it like a huge existential question. Which is like: Why do I do what I do? Like, why do we do what we do? And I ask myself this from time to time. Sometimes it’s almost like a facial wrinkle that you find for the first time at 39. Like, you don’t wanna look too closely at it. But I think my answer is something like this: I’m not trying to optimize my audience for size. If that was my goal, if my No. 1 goal was to have the biggest possible audience, I would just lie. I would lie constantly. I would lie about conspiracy theories. I would lie about important figures. I would take tremendous and liberal advantage of the First Amendment and just lie constantly, without any concept of a personal integrity. What do I actually enjoy about the job? I really enjoy writing pieces, like everything is television. I enjoy figuring stuff out. I enjoy having theories about the world. I enjoy having those theories interrogated. I enjoy learning where I was wrong, and then writing a new theory. I love coming up with ideas like “Abundance,” where not only is it fun to write the original essay, but also it’s fun to talk to people about it when it catches on with other people. And so that’s where I’m basically thinking: All right. I want to have conversations with people on my podcast that are turned into essays that deal with culture and science and technology and politics. And I think the best way to have those conversations in a way that reaches the people who would be most likely to be interested in those ideas is to make my podcast a television show. But this question of like, why do I do what I do is like—I’m always coming back to it. Because I think it’s a good, big, important question. And more people, I think, would be better served by consistently, like, checking back in with themselves about What exactly am I trying to do in this life? Warzel: I wanted to sort of end here and talk about, you know—your essay ends on a slightly ominous note, right? Like this idea you’ve done a lot of writing and reporting on—the antisocial century and notion that people are are alone and struggling in a lot of ways. And also the technology is sort of enabling that disconnect, right? This idea of like, things in the background all the time; shortened attention spans. Less ability to engage with these ideas; less ability to engage with one’s own ideas. Or just like, you know, to be able to put something on that can serve as a buffer from reality, in whatever way. Even if that means, like, going out and seeing friends or doing whatever. I think it’s very easy to get pretty, you know, sort of staring off into the void on a lot of these things. But I’m curious if anything’s changed since you’ve written that. Like, do you feel like if we don’t find, you know, ways to put guardrails a little bit around this societal tendency—to kind of move toward that, down the funnel to the sort of the easiest, most frictionless thing in terms of media consumption, in terms of whatever—that we’re headed toward this dangerous place? Or, how are you thinking about that now? Is it still kind of this ominous feeling that you have, or has stuff changed? Thompson: I feel pretty ominous about the future, and it’s partly because I’m not sure that we’re made to broadcast. Like, as a species. And there’s something actually very hard and discomfiting and unusual about speaking to a thousand people at once, or a hundred thousand people at once, or a million people at once, or many millions of people at once—as many podcasters are. That’s a very strange thing. It’s surely doesn’t seem like it’s something that’s natural to our mammalian history. There’s several studies that suggest that the tenor of our conversations changes significantly when we move from one-to-one interactions to one-to-1,000 interactions. If I recall, there was a study that was done asking people to write notes to one person versus writing a note that would be read by a thousand people. And the note to that one person asked a lot about that other person. But the note to the thousand people just reflected on themselves. Because how can you possibly have a personal conversation with a thousand people at once? You can’t. And so the idea from this study, which I think was done by Jonah Berger at Wharton, was that when we broadcast, because we can’t look outside of ourselves, all who we’re broadcasting to: We look inside of ourselves. And just talk about ourselves. Which suggests that a world in which our children are raised, and we raise ourselves, around broadcast media is a world where we’re more fixated on ourselves rather than focus on other people. And that’s a place where maybe “everything is television” and “the antisocial century” sort of come together. There’s a weird way I think in that our aloneness, as I said in that essay, or our alone time is less alone than it used to be. And our time with other people is more alone than it used to be. That is, when you are alone—by yourself on a couch—you don’t actually have to be fully alone. You can pull out your phone and be on social media and immediately, boom, get into a fight with someone about politics. Right? So your alone time can be weirdly synthetically social. But also, when you’re surrounded by other people, if you go to a party, you can choose to be alone whenever you want. You can stand in the corner and pull out your phone. And then boom—suddenly you’re alone. And so I think that these technologies are changing us in ways that are both talked about all the time, right? Rise of anxiety, rise of narcissism. And they’re changing us in ways that I think might be, like, underconsidered, undertheorized. They’re changing so much about what it means to be a person, and what it means to be able to sit still with oneself. And it, therefore, raises questions about: Do you actually need to sit still by yourself and listen to your thoughts, ever? Like, is that good for you at all? Should you just always choose to download other people’s thoughts inside of your brain, so you’re never stuck with the sort of subvocal questions of your own consciousness? I feel honest about this, because I’m not sure that these are, like, familiar feelings. I feel like we’re sort of being thrust into, again, a kind of really unnatural experiment based on these technologies. And given the changes in mental health over the last few decades, it’s not entirely clear to me if surrounding ourselves with the constant—bombarding ourselves with the constant thoughts for the people—is particularly good for our sanity. So, I don’t feel great about it. But also in the biggest picture, I am dispositionally an optimist. And I would hope that if you look at the history of something like the printing press—well, clearly the printing press contributed to enormous warfare throughout Europe, over the rise of Protestantism and the wars within Christianity for decades, even centuries. But also, like: I’m very glad that books exist. So I hope that we don’t have wars that kill tens of millions of people over short-form video. But also I think that maybe one lesson of the printing press is that really destabilizing technologies have a period of destabilization, but ultimately we find some way to use them so that we can get the most out of them. And, maybe the same way that we’re mourning the printing press—or the fruits of the printing press right now, which is to say reading on pulp—who knows, maybe a hundred years from now we’re going to be mourning straight-to-camera video, because there’ll be some other media technology. And we’re like, My God, there’s the golden ages. And Derek and Charlie didn’t even know it. Warzel: I think that the part of all of this that stands out to me is that bit that you said about, like, how natural it is to broadcast. Right? And you cite a stat that I’ve seen before in the piece, I’m going to get it wrong, but it’s the ratio of how much people consume. The 99-1 rule. Ninety percent of the people consume; nine percent remix; one percent actually create. And I think about that with just the internet at large—with lurkers, right? Most people are lurkers. Most people have a great online experience, because they lurk, they consume, they find stuff. They do participate in these ways—but not in this public manner. And I think when you and I have so many conversations about whether it was the social-media revolution or the AI stuff or whatever. Going back to this idea of—as you did—the printing press and the advent of these media technologies, and how long it takes for us to sort of, you know, inoculate ourselves or develop the coping strategies. Or, you know, the social mores around these types of technologies. And I think what makes sense to me—and I have no insight as to where this could possibly go—is this idea around, like, what is out of whack right now? It’s this broadcast-and-consumption-type thing, right? There are people, it feels to me, like—it puts stresses onto people who aren’t naturally fit for that. Right. Or who just don’t even want it, and are forced into this, you know—basically orienting themselves to the world in a different way. Because that’s the only way they know how to, you know, maybe be seen. And I think figuring out how to come into a better balance, and with all of this, and all these technologies, like that’s my optimistic look. As to like, how these things can start to, you know, maybe level out a little bit more than they are. And feel a little less like, out of control. Or like, you know, everything is morphing [00:28:00] into one medium or one style. Thompson: And I guess the last thing I would say is—and this is incredibly hyper-hypocritical to come from me and to to be heard by you—I’m very happy to be in the media game, the attention game. But when I read that for five straight years, members of Generation Z have told pollsters that the thing they want more than anything when they grow up is to be an influencer, which is to say essentially be in the same attention game, I just think that’s bad. I think that there’s something about getting into this attention game—and learning its rules and realizing how catastrophe sells and realizing how conspiracy sells and realizing how negativity sells—that creates an environment of catastrophe and conspiracy and negativity. A world of too much media means a world in which the grammar of media and the psychology of media takes over things that should theoretically be a little bit more inoculated from media. I’m not sure, for example, that the right thing for our politics is for more politicians to be on TikTok. And so again, one reason why I’m a little bit—why I think the future of everything is television is somewhat ominous is that I don’t think the values and the virtues that emerge from everyone trying to become a television star are the values and virtues that people would choose if they just had tabula rasa trying to create a society. Where do we start? Right? Generosity, time for others, reflectiveness, inwardness. So, there’s lots of ways the future can go. But I absolutely feel like this is a trend that’s going to make the future feel quite weird and berserk. Warzel: And that is the music of the Galaxy Brain podcast. “Quite weird and berserk future.” Derek, thank you so much for your reporting and all your time. Thompson: Very happy to sing your theme song. Warzel: As it turns out, the reason you’re seeing my face is really complicated. Video seems to be eating the world, right—but it’s bigger than just that. This thing that I am obsessed with on the show is how the media we make, and the media we consume in aggregate, actually just tells us a lot about who we are and what we want. And how our technologies are shaping and influencing our behavior, our culture. And I think now, especially in our politics, we’re living in this lonely, fragmented, hyperactive attention economy. Right? That has opened up just a ton of possibilities for people to make things, to tell stories, to understand the world and share those understandings with others. But I think that this fragmentation can—and definitely is—leading to this inwardness, this isolation, this polarization. And I think that we’re even seeing some, in some cases, this change from a more reflective and sort of deliberative society to one that’s a lot more knee-jerk. A lot less interested in nuance. And I don’t know where any of this is heading, but I think that Derek said it best when he said that we’re kind of barreling toward this future that can feel weird and berserk. And I don’t really know where we go from here, but I can promise you that what this show’s going to try to do is: It’s going to try to chart this trajectory and just give you something to hold onto all the while. So that’s it from us here. If you liked what you saw, if you want to continue to see my face on YouTube, new episodes of Galaxy Brain drop every Friday.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © NATO alliance flag on Europe map. North Atlantic Treaty Organization. High quality photo (Shutterstock.com) by Rokas Tenys Going into the final weeks of 2025, the S&P 500 has had another strong year. ETFs that track the S&P 500 have posted double-digit returns yet again for the year, with Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO) coming in year-to-date at 18.43% and SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) right behind at 18.34% at the time of this writing. Much of these gains can be credited to the multi-trillion net capital valuations that have swelled with Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and other Magnificent 7 AI stocks that festoon the S&P 500’s top 10. However, there are many household name companies that are not a part of the S&P 500 top 10, mostly due to their lack of AI development. A good number of them aren’t even American. For example – Nestle (chocolate), AstroZeneca (pharma), and LVMH (luxury goods) are all European companies whose products have garnered widespread use, and their respective stock prices have risen accordingly. A notable point is that none of these companies’ gains are contingent upon any in-house AI development, but rather on intrinsic value of their respective products and sales. Nevertheless, they are essential in the market, and all three can be found in the top 10 list of another ETF: the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK). More intriguing is the fact that VGK currently sports a year-to-date return of 32.97%, which is 79% higher than VOO and only a few points shy of doubling its returns. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF contains over 1,200 stocks hailing from the Eurozone and Scandinavia. Issued by Vanguard, the second largest asset manager in the world after BlackRock, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF tracks the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, which covers stocks from the Eurozone and Scandinavia. Passively managed, its inception dates back to 3-4-2005. An overview of VGK appears below: The top 10 holdings of VGK are: As one can see, unlike with VOO or SPY, in which 7 out of the top 10 are AI tech companies, the top 10 holdings of VGK contain a wider range of industrial sectors: pharma, technology, financial, and luxury goods. In fact, VGK’s sector concentration puts technology at #6, or 8.27%, behind: Michael “The Big Short” Burry is one of the higher profile critics of the perceived AI bubble, which has prompted the shift of many funds into VGK and other ETFs with solid growth upside without AI dependency. There are a number of reasons why VGK has been able to outperform VOO and SPY this year. It is admittedly an anomaly. Historically, it has usually lagged behind, sometimes by a substantial amount. However, 2025 contained certain events that helped to give VGK a big boost. A few of these include: Geopolitical Tariff Fears: In March, President Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy announcement caused a big drop in the S&P 500, since many believed the analysts and pundits that it would trigger massive inflation and supply chain issues. With WalMart and other US retailers relying on Chinese manufacturing for millions of their best-selling retail items, the concerns over a renewed trade war with China were understandably disconcerting. Europe, on the other hand, felt the impact much less severely. The initial trade conflicts largely were focused on China and India, so the comparative stability of European markets drew investors from all over the world who were seeking less volatility and unknown economic outcomes. Sector Preferences From Global Investors: The huge bull run on the AI focused Magnificent 7 stocks has created the first multi-trillion valuations of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, et. al. This has also led to fears that the AI industry has become a bubble, not unlike that of the dotcoms. Michael “The Big Short” Burry is a vocal critic of the AI bubble and of Nvidia in particular, and his track record for shorting economic bubbles in the market warranted a movie about his successful prediction of the 2008 subprime mortgage banking meltdown, starring Christian Bale as Burry. VGK’s 44% weighting towards financials and industrials became appealing to many institutional investors this year who shared Burry’s fears. Strength In Numbers: While the S&P 500 represents 500 of the strongest market-weighted companies representing a cross-section of US economic and financial health, the Magnificent 7 stocks are responsible for over half of the 18% gain YTD, making it a “live by the sword, die by the sword scenario”. By contrast, VGK’s index, the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, encompasses over 1,200 different stocks across multiple countries. Given the lower level of sector competition in each European and Scandinavian nation, each has its own territorial near-monopolies in various sectors, cumulatively making for multiple big winners all contributing to the overall index strength. As 2025 comes to a close, the S&P 500 is still not showing any signs of faltering, but Europe should be able to maintain at least some of its lead, provided it does not succumb to foolish policies or geopolitical in-fighting among EU members, such as Brussels’ attempts to compel Italy to accede to its migrant policy, which Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is staunchly resisting.

Title: Vanguard’s $11T Crypto Reversal: Can 50 Million New Investors Push Bitcoin to $100K?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Butus / Shutterstock.com Vanguard—one of the world’s largest asset managers—shocked the financial industry by reversing its long-held anti-crypto stance. The firm, which oversees $11 trillion in client assets, now allows Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and cryptocurrency ETFs on its brokerage platform starting December 2, 2025. This policy shift opens access for Vanguard’s 50 million clients (many of them conservative investors) to finally buy regulated crypto investment products. The move validates crypto’s place in mainstream finance and raises a critical question: could this influx of potential capital help drive Bitcoin’s price back to the $100,000 mark? Vintage Tone / Shutterstock.com For years, Vanguard stood out as a major holdout even as other financial giants embraced digital assets. When the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024 after lengthy SEC battles, Vanguard actively blocked its customers from buying those funds. So what changed by late 2025? Vanguard’s reversal came from shifts both inside and outside the company—new leadership played a key role. In July 2024, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as CEO, the first outsider to head the firm. Ramji came from BlackRock’s iShares division, where he helped launch that firm’s Bitcoin ETF, bringing a much more crypto-friendly perspective. Externally, regulations around crypto developed significantly. Under a more innovation-friendly administration, the SEC eased its stance and approved multiple spot crypto ETFs. Competitors like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and traditional banks moved ahead with crypto offerings, creating competitive pressure Vanguard couldn’t ignore. Studies found many younger, wealthy clients were leaving advisors who couldn’t offer crypto options, highlighting a growing business risk. Faced with these realities, Vanguard capitulated. The firm still won’t launch its own crypto funds, sticking to its core indexing philosophy. However, it now serves as a gateway for clients to buy crypto ETFs from other issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. The sheer scale of Vanguard’s $11 trillion clientele means the impact won’t arrive as a one-time tsunami, but as persistent demand. Fifty million new potential investors with trillions in assets don’t create overnight pumps—they create steady, persistent demand that supports multi-year bull markets. DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com The immediate market reaction to Vanguard’s crypto reversal was emphatic. Bitcoin’s price jumped roughly 6% in a single day when the news hit, briefly breaching $93,000 before settling around $91,000. Within minutes of the U.S. market opening on December 2, a wave of buying pressure sparked a sharp rally, catching many traders off guard. The surge liquidated an estimated $400 million worth of short positions—bets that Bitcoin’s price would fall—in 24 hours, as pessimistic traders scrambled to cover. One analyst noted the “violent move from $88,000 to $93,000 happened so fast because the market had loaded up on shorts” that got squeezed. Options markets saw heavy activity too, with large call options accumulating around the $95,000 to $100,000 strikes. That’s a sign some big players are positioning for Bitcoin approaching the $100K threshold soon. DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com Many crypto analysts are bullish about what Vanguard’s entry means for Bitcoin. They point out that Bitcoin’s supply is fixed at 21 million coins, with over 19.6 million already mined. Any influx of new buyers can have an outsized effect on price given the scarce supply. With tens of millions of new investors now gaining easy access through a trusted platform, the pool of potential Bitcoin demand has expanded dramatically. Each major wave of institutional adoption in the past has coincided with a leap in Bitcoin’s valuation. The late 2017 boom was fueled by retail and initial coin offerings. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin soar to $69,000 amid retail frenzy and corporate treasury buys. The 2024-2025 cycle, after ETF approvals, sent Bitcoin to new highs around $126,000 in October 2025. Bulls argue that Vanguard’s embrace could mark the next leg of Bitcoin’s maturation, potentially driving it to six-figure prices on sustained institutional buying. Some optimistic projections suggest Bitcoin could climb to $150,000-$200,000 by the end of 2026 if mainstream adoption continues at this pace, meaning $100K might be just a stepping stone. Vanguard’s entry has sparked a new wave of bullish Bitcoin predictions. Here are three possible predictions for the BTC price heading into 2026. In an optimistic scenario, Bitcoin enters 2026 with strong momentum as Vanguard clients allocate even modest percentages to crypto. If just 1% of Vanguard’s $11 trillion flows into Bitcoin ETFs over the next year, that’s $110 billion in new capital. Combined with continued institutional demand and regulatory clarity, Bitcoin could push past $100,000 and test $120,000-$150,000 by late 2026. Outside Vanguard’s influence, other catalysts support this case. U.S. regulators approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, opening crypto to mainstream funds. ETFs have gathered roughly $121 billion in assets by December 2025. Assuming continued strong ETF inflows (several billion per quarter) and no major macro shocks, Bitcoin would likely follow a grinding uptrend toward new all-time highs. In a moderate scenario, Bitcoin’s price rises steadily but without parabolic gains. Vanguard’s customers remain conservative and allocate slowly. Initial allocation rates might be around 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible Vanguard assets flowing into crypto early on, translating to just a few billion dollars spread across various crypto ETFs over the first year. That alone won’t catapult Bitcoin’s price to six figures overnight. The base case portrays Bitcoin making modest gains into 2026, aided by steady investment from Vanguard investors, institutional flows, and clearer U.S. regulation, but without the hyper-enthusiasm or panic of extreme cases. Bitcoin trades in a $90,000-$110,000 range for much of 2026, with occasional tests of $115,000-$120,000 during bullish periods. Cautious analysts urge a more tempered outlook if things don’t go according to plan. Critics point out that Vanguard is late to the party—their clients missed out on huge gains from 2023 to 2025 while the firm dragged its feet, and those big early opportunities won’t simply repeat on command. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds could dampen enthusiasm. If the Federal Reserve holds rates higher for longer or if recession fears intensify, risk assets like Bitcoin could suffer. The timing of Vanguard’s reversal also matters. Bitcoin already rallied from $15,000 in late 2022 to over $126,000 in October 2025—much of the institutional adoption story might already be priced in. In a bearish scenario, Bitcoin could consolidate in the $70,000-$85,000 range through 2026, with brief spikes to $95,000 followed by pullbacks. The $100,000 milestone would remain elusive as profit-taking and cautious macro sentiment cap gains. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/12/2025 8:51:36 AM PST by DFG WTF? BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is now directly involved in Ukraine negotiations alongside Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Source: Bloomberg. We’ve gone from a moneyproxy war to a privatized reconstruction racket, and now to global asset managers and Trump’s inner-circle real-estate cronies literally inserting themselves into diplomatic negotiations over a live war zone. BlackRock has already positioned itself to manage Ukraine’s postwar “rebuilding” aka a $400+ billion fire-sale of national assets. Now Fink is reportedly sitting at the table with Twink Kushner and Real Estate Agent Witkoff, because to them Ukraine’s fate is a business venture, not a sovereign crisis. Are you getting it yet?

Title: Geminid meteor shower set to light up Irish skies

A meteor shower is expected to light up Irish skies tonight, with around 20 times more shooting stars than normal. The geminid meteor shower is set to reach its peak activity tomorrow night and into Sunday morning. However, Blackrock Castle Observatory centre manager Alan Giltinan said tonight will be the best night to catch sight of a shooting star due to a poor weather outlook across the weekend. He said that there could be up to 10-15 shooting stars per hour, but up to 100-120 per hour is possible. From 10pm onwards tomorrow night, stargazers should look to the east to try catch sight of the dazzling display.

According to Astronomy Ireland, up to around 20 times more shooting stars could be seen. They say that rural areas will get the most spectacular views, but city dwellers should see plenty too due to the bright glow of the meteors. Astronomy Ireland explained that the geminid meteor shower is caused by tiny pieces of space debris that fell off an extinct comet or asteroid called Phaethon that goes around the sun every one-and-a-half years. © RTÉ 2025.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (NYSEARCA:SOXS) offers a contrarian bet against the AI boom, delivering three times the inverse daily performance of semiconductor stocks. While the ETF has attracted attention for its dividend distributions, understanding how this fund generates income reveals why it’s fundamentally different from traditional dividend investments. SOXS doesn’t hold semiconductor stocks or collect dividends from companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Instead, the fund uses derivatives including swaps and futures to achieve -3x daily exposure to the ICE Semiconductor Index. Approximately 66% of the fund’s $1.1 billion in assets sits in cash collateral, primarily Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Treasury Instruments, generating interest income. Additional distributions come from gains when semiconductor stocks decline and the fund profits from short positions. The fund paid $0.056 per share in its September 2025 distribution. Based on the current price of $2.95, this translates to an annualized yield of approximately 7.6%. Some sources cite yields approaching 20% by projecting forward based on historical volatility in distributions, which ranged from $0.056 to $0.185 quarterly throughout 2025. SOXS distributions are highly unstable because they depend on two volatile factors: interest rates on cash collateral and gains from semiconductor stock declines. When semiconductors rally, as they have throughout 2025, the fund generates minimal profits from short positions while experiencing severe price decay from daily rebalancing costs. The fund’s 0.97% expense ratio and daily reset mechanism create structural headwinds. SOXS has declined 87% year-to-date in 2025, falling from $22.12 to $2.95. Over five years, the fund has lost 99.86% of its value. A 10% yield provides little consolation when the underlying ETF loses 87% of its value. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (NYSEARCA:SOXS) offers a contrarian bet against the AI boom, delivering three times the inverse daily performance of semiconductor stocks. While the ETF has attracted attention for its dividend distributions, understanding how this fund generates income reveals why it’s fundamentally different from traditional dividend investments. SOXS doesn’t hold semiconductor stocks or collect dividends from companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Instead, the fund uses derivatives including swaps and futures to achieve -3x daily exposure to the ICE Semiconductor Index. Approximately 66% of the fund’s $1.1 billion in assets sits in cash collateral, primarily Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Treasury Instruments, generating interest income. Additional distributions come from gains when semiconductor stocks decline and the fund profits from short positions. The fund paid $0.056 per share in its September 2025 distribution. Based on the current price of $2.95, this translates to an annualized yield of approximately 7.6%. Some sources cite yields approaching 20% by projecting forward based on historical volatility in distributions, which ranged from $0.056 to $0.185 quarterly throughout 2025. SOXS distributions are highly unstable because they depend on two volatile factors: interest rates on cash collateral and gains from semiconductor stock declines. When semiconductors rally, as they have throughout 2025, the fund generates minimal profits from short positions while experiencing severe price decay from daily rebalancing costs. The fund’s 0.97% expense ratio and daily reset mechanism create structural headwinds. SOXS has declined 87% year-to-date in 2025, falling from $22.12 to $2.95. Over five years, the fund has lost 99.86% of its value. A 10% yield provides little consolation when the underlying ETF loses 87% of its value. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Artificial intelligence-focused stocks are coming under pressure on Friday, dragging tech-related equities and bitcoin BTC$89,786.61 lower during the early U.S. session. Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), the ninth largest asset by market cap, tumbled 10% despite strong earnings as its outlook disappointed investors' lofty expectations. The Nasdaq index was down over 1% in the first hour of the session. Adding that to Oracle's 10% slump on Thursday and a further 3% decline on Friday, as investor concerns are mounting that the red-hot AI theme that fueled much of this year's stock market gains might be fizzling out. Bitcoin, trading around $92,500 overnight, plunged 2% following the U.S. stock market open to $89,800 recently, extending the choppy action through the week. A consistent theme this week has been bitcoin setting intraday lows during U.S. trading hours, a pattern that has led to the filing of the proposed AfterDark Hours ETF. Bitcoin miners, some of which have been increasingly leaning into AI for diversification, showed a similar reaction to Broadcom’s miss. Hut 8 (HUT) fell more than 5%. Iren (RIEN) and Riot (RIOT) dropped about 4%, while Cipher(CIFR) and Iren (IREN) both were down about 2% over the past day. Crypto-related stocks also fell alongside the Nasdaq. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) were both down nearly 2%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was hit hard and fell more than 5%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped slightly. Markets had already been under pressure after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech on Wednesday, which hinted at a possible rate cut pause in January. As a result, markets now expect only two rate cuts in 2026 instead of three. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who was against a December rate cut, however, said he expects more in 2026 than the current median projection. Several other members of the Federal Reserve will also speak over the course of today as the central bank's blackout period following its December meeting on Wednesday has ended. Traders will be looking for any guidance on whether Fed officials agree with Powell on potentially holding rates steady in January.

Title: Replacing The Woo Products Module With Custom Loops In Divi 5

Posted on December 12, 2025 by Christopher Morris 2 Comments The WooCommerce Products Module is Divi’s built-in solution for displaying products. It automatically connects to your shop and provides quick toggles for product images, titles, prices, ratings, and add-to-cart buttons. Divi 5‘s new Loop Builder takes a fundamentally different approach to building product features. You design the product card with any modules you choose, and then dynamically feed WooCommerce data into it. Both tools display product listings, yet each excels in different scenarios. You can use either, but the Loop Builder offers far more flexibility, which could help you build a better online store. Let’s compare the two. The WooCommerce Products Module is built for standard ecommerce patterns. It assumes you want recognizable product cards and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how WooCommerce products work. Every product shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as ecommerce content. These shared characteristics include: The Products Module was designed with these traditional elements in mind. Images show what you’re selling. Titles identify the product. Prices tell customers what it costs. The add-to-cart button completes the sale. Divi’s Products Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in filtering tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the rating but keep the price, show sale badges, or skip the description. Small decisions and quick results. The Products Module can display WooCommerce products along with filtering options for product types (like featured products). The Products Module works great when you stick to WooCommerce’s standard data structure. It limits its options to fields that are native to WooCommerce’s default product data. Detailed specifications, custom badges, shipping estimates, or anything custom won’t appear in the Products Module because it was built for standard WooCommerce fields. The module has no toggle for those custom product details. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module uses a fixed grid structure, allowing you to set the number of grid columns. However, it does not include Divi’s newest Grid and Flex CSS layout controls. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying WooCommerce products. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, the Loop Builder allows you to construct your product display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Products Module. With the Products Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With the Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to working with custom product displays: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop” with a query type of “Products,” it repeats itself for each matching product. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, Button, and any other Divi modules. Can also be used in the Theme Builder set to “Posts for Current Page” You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct WooCommerce data token. Divi’s UI makes this straightforward. The Image points to the product image. The Heading points to the product title. The Text Module can show the price. The Button links to the add-to-cart action or product page. This modular approach gives you complete structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can add multiple text blocks for price, SKU, and custom fields. You can create unique badge designs or custom rating displays. This way, you build the product card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a quick scenario. We’ll quickly build a similar product card (compared with the example Products Module above) and swap the data sources to show the Loop Builder’s flexibility. And apply some styles that will be used with each post item in the loop. Then, build a custom Loop for standard WooCommerce products. Use the “Product” post type. We will also use four post items in this loop. Now, we’ll quickly assign some basic dynamic content to the sub-modules of this Loop. We’ll start with Product Featured Image, Product Title, and Product Price. Now, if you have custom fields with data applied through a WooCommerce extension, you can apply those via Custom Field assignments inside the Dynamic Content selector. I also went ahead and added an icon and changed up the flex settings to arrange the items better. And this is the end result. A clean-looking card for a product category page through the Theme Builder. It utilizes a custom field and simple filtering, making the Loop Builder ideal for this purpose. How do you add those custom fields to WooCommerce products? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here, while Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset can also do the job. Numerous WooCommerce extensions offer this functionality specifically for WooCommerce. This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Products Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Products Module when the card you want to design includes only standard WooCommerce fields. Straightforward product catalogs that link out to individual product pages. The Products Module also has slightly better filtering options, so you can showcase featured products or those on sale. Use the Loop Builder when you need custom fields that standard WooCommerce products don’t include, or when your product card design doesn’t match a stock pattern. The trade-off is that you’ll need to work around the missing WooCommerce-specific filters by using categories, tags, or custom fields instead. Divi’s Products Module is still the fastest way to display a standard WooCommerce product grid, and it remains the only option for WooCommerce-specific filters, such as featured products, sale items, best-sellers, and sorting by price or popularity. The Loop Builder unlocks custom product cards, custom fields, unique layouts, and complete design control. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design you have in mind, whereas the Products Module has some limitations. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the particular section you are creating.

Title: AI is powering Trump’s economy, but American voters are getting worried

President Donald Trump is heading into the 2026 election year vowing to pull out all the stops to promote artificial intelligence — just as American voters are starting to voice some doubts. All through Trump’s first year back in office, almost everyone had something to say about AI. Economists detailed how it’s powering US growth. White House aides explained why it’s key to staying ahead of China. Stock-watchers cheered a market boom, and fretted about a bubble. Tech geeks speculated about what the bots might one day be able to do. The president helped fuel the buzz, appearing alongside various tycoons to announce big AI projects. On Thursday, he signed an order seeking to limit states from imposing their own curbs on AI — marking another win for the industry. “Our administration is committed to total dominance in technology,” he said a day before at a White House event with prominent tech executives. “Right now, we’re leading artificial intelligence by a lot.” One group that hasn’t gotten much of a hearing above the hubbub is the US electorate. But in last month’s off-year contests there were signs of an AI backlash, one that could amplify concerns about the cost of living and the job-market outlook in Trump’s economy. At the local level, many voters objected to the spread of data centers, the building blocks of AI’s advance, whose huge demand for electricity is getting linked to bigger household bills. That affordability issue now has political traction. It helped Democrats score major wins in Virginia and New Jersey. On top of that, there’s the employment risk. Data centers create plenty of construction jobs but not so many once they’re up and running. Worse, there are widespread fears that the technologies incubated there may turn out to be job-killers. None of this means AI isn’t key to America’s economic future — just that it’s hard to sell as a political priority in the meantime. That’s particularly true for a White House already struggling to convince voters that Trump’s economic policies are working. Perhaps there’s an echo of the debate over free trade. Economists, executives and investors all predicted long-run benefits, but millions of American voters reckoned they’d drawn a short straw, and the disruption helped bring Trump to power. Now Steve Bannon, one of the populist MAGA movement’s architects, has all but declared war on AI, citing economic, political and even religious reasons to rein it in. “They are coming at you from every different direction. They want your productivity until they get the robots and then they’ll toss you aside like trash,” the former Trump strategist said on his “Bannon’s War Room” podcast, in a November episode devoted to the dangers of AI. The White House has pointed to potential productivity gains from AI as enriching workers and businesses. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett — seen as the frontrunner to be Trump’s next Federal Reserve chair — in a recent Fox Business interview said AI would “make a lot of productive workers a heck of a lot of money.” AI technology will aid, not replace, American workers, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to detail their thinking. Ensuring the US is a leader in AI will help create more employment opportunities and also lower costs for services and goods, further spurring job growth, according to the official. The Department of Labor said it was investing in skills training to help workers benefit from AI and to help fill surging demand for jobs to build out the technology’s infrastructure. Still, there’s anxiety at the grassroots level — and it’s not only politicians who’ll have to factor that in. There’s been a surge this year in the number of data center plans blocked or delayed by local opposition, according to Data Center Watch, a monitor run by AI intelligence company 10a Labs. Its research identifies $98 billion of investments stymied in the second quarter, more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023. That’s adding time, uncertainty and political risk to some projects, which investors will likely start to price in, said Miquel Vila, an analyst at the group. Lordstown in northeast Ohio illustrates the gap between the upbeat talk from the top and anxiety on the ground. It’s one of five locations where AI infrastructure is being developed as part of Stargate, a $500 billion project announced by Trump in January on his first full day back in the White House. But not far away, another company backing a separate $3.6 billion data center project is finding that many residents don’t want it — even though the region could use an economic lift, after losing 40% of its manufacturing jobs in the past two decades. Bristolville 25 Developer LLC wants to build a data center campus on 133 acres of industrially zoned property. The village council is trying to block large-scale data centers because of concerns like rising power costs, water usage and pollution, and Lordstown Mayor Jackie Woodward said four council elections last month hinged on whether candidates opposed such projects. “I don’t have the money to pay a bigger electric bill or bigger water bill,” Richard Coe, a 78-year-old Lordstown retiree, told the council at a Nov. 3 meeting. “So I would appreciate that our council members take that into account.” In letters to village officials, attorneys for Bristolville outlined benefits that the investment would bring, including more than a million dollars a year in state and local income tax revenue, plus millions in property taxes. Bristolville has also offered $10.8 million for water infrastructure upgrades, as well as contributions to a community fund for facilities like an event center or pickleball court. The venture would employ an estimated 1,600 workers during peak construction, and then 120 full-time employees with an average wage of more than $84 per hour. That’s not enough permanent jobs to justify the impact on the community, said Lordstown Council President Robert Bond. “We don’t see the advantage tying up large industrial acreage for 120 jobs.” Among leading Republicans, it’s state governors who are most worried about an AI backlash, according to one Trump adviser who says the party wants to “win the AI race” but hasn’t really figured out what that means. Concerns at this stage are more focused on electricity bills, which threaten to become a benchmark affordability measure like gas-pump prices have traditionally been, than the risk to white-collar jobs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, who earlier this year intervened to preserve an exemption from state sales taxes for data centers, isn’t among the doubters. He says rising electricity prices are “a legitimate discussion,” but doesn’t think local opposition will stunt the industry in Ohio. “We believe that data centers bring other business, that they bring other jobs into the state,” DeWine says. Back in Washington, the Trump administration seems chiefly interested in ensuring AI companies keep expanding — since that’s what is powering the economy and equity markets. Trump this week granted permission to Nvidia Corp. to export its high-end H200 chip to China, bypassing national security concerns that had previously loomed large. Many analysts calculate that the AI boom accounted for more than half of US GDP growth in the first six months of 2025, and see that trend continuing when third-quarter numbers come out. The big tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. — have tripled their capital spending, which will likely exceed $500 billion in 2026 according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Many of these companies donated to Trump’s presidential inauguration, or his new White House ballroom, or both. There’s consensus on Wall Street that AI has driven most of the gains on the S&P 500this year — but disagreement over whether that’s pushed the market into bubble territory. Lenders who funneled cash into the data-center rollout have begun to seek hedges. Oaktree Capital Management LP’s Howard Marks plunged into the debate this week, calling the AI risk to employment “terrifying.” Economists are scouring the data — which is patchy, thanks to the long government shutdown – for early signs of where the AI economy is ultimately headed, for better or worse. That could show up as faster productivity growth, or AI-driven job cuts, or strains on the electrical system, though it’s likely too soon to be sure. In both political parties there’s a sense that more thought-out AI strategies will be needed – but neither of them has one right now, according to another Trump adviser, who calls AI a “political football.” Leading Democrats like Virginia Senator Mark Warner and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have cited the need for lawmakers to respond faster to the pace of change without offering much in the way of policy proposals. Democratic candidates who won governorship contests in Virginia and New Jersey promised steps to shield households from higher power prices driven by data centers. In the coming weeks, the White House is expected to release a much-anticipated executive order on expanding the US electric grid. It will include measures focused on bolstering transmission capacity and enhancing grid technology, according to a person who’s been briefed on drafts. Politically the message is far simpler: The administration is trying to show it’s doing all it can to boost power output in the hope of bringing down prices. And it’s redoubled the effort after Democratic ballot wins in November, amid expectations that data centers will consume more energy and keep pushing electricity prices up. Gene Sperling, a former National Economic Council director and adviser to former President Joe Biden, sees a similarity with the 2024 election campaign. Biden and then his deputy, Kamala Harris, campaigned hard on the big-money investments in electric cars and clean energy their policies had delivered. But voter anxieties about the cost of living helped swing the election to Trump. There might be a lesson there on AI for Republicans heading into 2026, Sperling told Bloomberg TV. “You would let people know, ‘Hey, we want to lead in AI, we want to beat China,’” he said. “But we also want to do it in a way that you’re not seeing people make hundreds of millions of dollars while your electricity costs are going up.”

Get earnings reminders, our top analysis on Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, market updates, and brand-new stock recommendations delivered directly to your inbox. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian downgraded PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) stock to neutral with a $66 price target this morning. “We were already below consensus for 2026 and 2027 EPS,” notes Sebastian, and now “we think that a combination of uneven transaction volumes thus far in Q4, along with another investment cycle on tap in 2026, and uncertain timing around broader platform improvements mean that a ‘clearing event’ is less likely near term.” It’s not entirely clear what he means by that, but in the context of a downgrade, it certainly doesn’t sound like good news! Most likely, Sebastian is looking for clear signs that PayPal’s business is on the upswing — and he doesn’t expect to see any. “We remain constructive longer term given opportunities to improve branded checkout, accelerate Venmo monetization,” admits the analyst. Still, until PayPal shows it’s gaining market share and showing better revenue growth, it seems this analyst won’t be recommending anyone buy PayPal stock. PayPal stock is down 0.6% on the report. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is down 1.5% today. Camping- and fishing-goods supplier Johnson Outdoors (Nasdaq: JOUT) missed earnings by a massive $2.15 this morning, reporting a fiscal Q4 2025 loss of $2.83 per share. This was despite beating revenue estimates with sales of $135.8 million. Losses did improve year over year (meaning Johnson Outdoors lost a bit less money), but didn’t improve as much as Wall Street wanted. Shares of the stock aren’t down too much considering the size of the miss, though, only about 3%. Warehouse store operator Costco (Nasdaq: COST) beat by 22 cents last night, reporting fiscal Q1 2026 earnings of $4.50 per share. Sales likewise exceeded expectations at $67.3 billion. Same store sales at Costco grew a solid 6.4% year over year. At the same time, Costco is growing sales through new store openings. Costco plans to open about 30 new stores annually going forward (net of old store closings) — not that the company necessarily needs more physical locations. E-commerce sales through Costco’s website, says the company, grew 24% in the quarter. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) ended up gaining a modest 0.25% on Thursday, one day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by the expected… 0.25%. Just a coincidence, I’m sure. And it’s a coincidence, too, that with zero interest rate cuts remaining in 2025, the Voo is exactly flat premarket today. That doesn’t mean there’s no news to report, however. The biggest news today, for a certain class of investors at least, is that The Washington Post is reporting President Trump plans to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, significantly easing restrictions on the drug’s possession and use. From an investing perspective, this will permit banks to service marijuana companies and states to regulate the drug. Trump could issue his order as soon as next month, reports CNBC, and new federal regulations could issue from the Drug Enforcement Agency as early as this coming summer. Shares of leading cannabis stocks such as Aurora Cannabis (Nasdaq: ACB), Canopy Growth (Nasdaq: CGC), and Tilray (Nasdaq: TLRY) are soaring on the news, up 20%, 25%, and 38% premarket. Meanwhile in tech, Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) may increase production of its H200 artificial intelligence chip, its second-fastest AI chip, purpose-built for sale in China and subject to a 25% export tariff by the U.S. President Trump said Tuesday the U.S. will permit Nvidia to export H200 chips to China. Nvidia investors like the move, and Nvidia stock is up 0.5% premarket. In other tech news, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) beat earnings by eight cents last night. The chipmaker reported fiscal Q4 2025 earnings of $1.95 per share, and beat revenue estimates by $500 million with $18 billion in quarterly sales. Broadcom also guided higher for fiscal Q1 2026, saying revenue should be $19.1 billion, also ahead of estimates — but apparently not ahead enough. Broadcom shares are down 5% premarket.

Title: BeToken Transforms an 18-Year Business Into a Web3 Asset

December 12, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: BeToken BeToken BARCELONA, Spain, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a market saturated with speculative crypto launches and short-lived experiments, a new European project is taking a fundamentally different path. BeToken, built on the operational backbone of Beself Brands, is introducing a model where tokenisation is no longer a promise for the future but a real extension of a business that has been running successfully for nearly two decades. The initiative marks a significant shift: tokenisation is finally stepping into the real economy. $BTK is Designed Around a Profitable Business Unlike most blockchain projects that begin with an idea and hope to build traction later, BeToken starts from a position of strength. Beself Brands, the company behind the token, was founded in 2007 and today operates a network of retail and ecommerce brands that reach hundreds of thousands of customers across Europe. Over the years, the group has built multi-million dollar revenues, strong customer loyalty, and the infrastructure needed to scale efficiently. This foundation is what makes BeToken different. It is not attempting to create value from scratch. Instead, it is opening access to value already proven in the market. For media and investors, this represents a rare case where a token is not detached from real-world performance but directly linked to a functioning, profitable business. Portfolio of Leading Consumer Brands The tokenisation initiative is anchored in a broad ecosystem of more than 1,000 products and several household-name brands in their categories. Beself Brands operates FITFIU Fitness, Greencut, Mc Haus, Beeloom, and Playkin, all of which have grown steadily through operational excellence, efficient logistics, and a clear understanding of European consumer demand. Tokenising part of this business is not just innovative, it positions BeToken among the first European retail ecommerce groups to take such a step. It signals a turning point: tokenisation is no longer reserved for financial instruments or theoretical real-world assets, but can be applied to real commerce with established supply chains and strong margins. As Mireia Calvet Verges, CEO of BeToken, said: "BeToken marks the beginning of a new era for Beself Brands: we are moving from being a consolidated, profitable European company with more than €20M in annual revenue to becoming a vehicle for exponential global growth. Our challenge is not demand — we already have it. What limits our acceleration is capital. We have strong brands, operations in 10 countries, and a clear plan to multiply our presence in key markets like France, Italy, and Germany. Tokenization allows us to break the barriers of traditional equity, bringing real liquidity and opening our expansion to a global investor base under a regulated, transparent, and efficient model. BeToken is not an experiment; it is the natural evolution of how modern companies should finance growth. With this initiative, we accelerate a business plan that will take us beyond €95M in sales within the next six years and drive sustained value appreciation across all our brands. Today, we are opening access to a tangible opportunity: becoming part of the future of Beself Brands." Access to High-Performing Companies One of the biggest barriers to investing in successful private companies has always been exclusivity. Access is typically limited to venture funds, private equity firms, or ultra-wealthy individuals. BeToken aims to change this dynamic by allowing anyone to participate in the company’s growth with a starting investment of €2,000. To make the entry experience even more appealing, the platform introduces tiered bonuses from 5% to 15% depending on the chosen investment pack. While simple in structure, this approach reflects a broader mission: to redefine how everyday investors can access and benefit from the growth of real businesses. Clarity and Transparency in Web3 Fundraising Clarity has become one of the strongest differentiators of the project. The BeToken platform prominently displays the official token price of €2.75, the effective price after bonuses, and the remaining availability in each tier. This level of transparency, although standard in traditional finance, is still uncommon in Web3 launches, where pricing often feels ambiguous or intentionally complex. For investors, this becomes a signal of maturity. For the broader market, it demonstrates that tokenisation can be executed with the same discipline and professionalism expected in established financial environments. Profit-Sharing Model At the core of the token’s design is alignment. BeToken holders participate proportionally in the performance of the entire group, gaining access to opportunities, exclusive benefits, and long-term upside that grows together with the company. This positions BeToken as part of a growing movement that sees tokens not simply as tradable digital assets but as vehicles for sharing the value generated by productive, real-world companies. It reflects what many analysts believe to be the future of retail investment, a bridge between traditional business performance and new digital ownership models. Built Under Regulatory Principles With MiCA shaping the future of digital assets in Europe, regulatory clarity has become a critical competitive advantage. From the outset, BeToken has prioritised compliance, transparency, and public documentation. The project follows a European approach to token structure, offering a contrast to many international launches that still operate without clear oversight. This alignment with evolving regulation not only increases investor confidence but also signals that tokenisation in Europe may develop differently, with stronger emphasis on protection, clarity, and long-term sustainability. A Scalable Model for RWA Movement What sets BeToken apart is not only what it represents today but what it could unlock tomorrow. The structure developed by Beself Brands is designed to be replicable, offering a blueprint for thousands of SMEs and mid-sized businesses looking for new ways to attract capital, engage their community, and modernise their financial operations. As Europe continues searching for a Web3 model rooted in tangible economic activity, BeToken is one of the first real cases capable of guiding the next wave of adoption. Limited Availability The launch introduces controlled scarcity by limiting the number of packs in each investment tier. With only 50, 40, 20, and 10 allocations available across the four levels, investors have a clear incentive to act early. For media outlets, this creates a timely narrative: this is not an open-ended raise, but a structured opportunity that reflects real business discipline. Global Tokenisation Trend BeToken enters the market at a moment when tokenisation is gaining global recognition. Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenised asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, while BlackRock refers to it as “the next great financial revolution.” In this context, BeToken becomes more than a company initiative. It stands as a European example of how real-world businesses can meaningfully adopt Web3 technology. Team With Deep Experience Behind the token is Beself Brands’ 18-year track record, built by a team of more than 60 professionals across logistics, operations, technology, and e-commerce. Their experience allows the project to merge traditional business excellence with modern digital infrastructure, a combination rarely seen in the current tokenisation landscape. About BeToken BeToken is a European tokenisation project built on Beself Brands, a consolidated retail and e-commerce group founded in 2007. Through a transparent, regulation-aligned model, BeToken allows investors to participate in the performance of an established multi-brand business. The project aims to set a new standard for real-world tokenisation in Europe. About Beself Brands Beself Brands operates some of Europe’s leading consumer brands, including FITFIU Fitness, Greencut, Mc Haus, Beeloom, and Playkin. With 18 years of operation, multi-million annual revenues, and strong logistics capacity, the group now brings its track record into the Web3 space through BeToken.

Investing Lululemon is up about 9%, or $17 a share on news that CEO Calvin McDonald announced he would leave the company Sending You to Google News in 3 © lupmotion / Shutterstock.com Shares of Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU) are up about 9%, or $17 a share in premarket trading today. All on news that CEO Calvin McDonald announced he would leave the company by the end of January 2026. The news is greatly welcomed after investors watched the LULU stock fall from a high of about $425 to its current price of $187.01. At the moment, LULU’s board of directors is working with an executive search firm to find its next CEO. In the meantime, Lululemon’s CFO Meghan Frank, and Chief Commercial Officer, André Maestrini, will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company also just reported EPS of $2.59, which was above estimates of $2.25. Revenue of $2.57 billion was above estimates of $2.48 billion. Unfortunately, guidance is expected to fall in between a range of $4.66 and $4.76, which is well below estimates of $5.03. Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are down about 6%, or $23.57 per share, in premarket. The company’s EPS of $1.95 was better than the estimated $1.86. Revenue of $18.02 billion was above the expected $17.49 billion. Plus, according to CEO Hock Tan, AI chip sales are expected to double year over year to $8.2 billion. Helping, analysts at Bernstein just raised their price target on AVGO to $475 on strong AI results. Unfortunately, the stock is slipping after the CEO said the company has a backlog of $73 billion in product orders that would be shipped over the next six quarters. That number was apparently disappointing, which destroyed the stock. Shares of Newmont (NYSE: NEM) are up another $2.40 a share in premarket. Not only is it running higher with gold prices, but it’s also generating record free cash flow of $1.6 billion, marking its fourth straight quarter of FCF growth over $1 billion. It’s also seeing a boost with margins thanks to cost-cutting efforts. Fueling more upside, analysts at Bank of America recently reiterated its buy rating on the NEM stock with a price target of $118. NEM is now trading at a new 52-week high and could rocket even higher with gold now above $4,327. From here, a good number of analysts say gold could rally above $5,000. Bank of America, for example, is targeting $5,000 by 2026. JPMorgan is targeting $5,055. HSBC analysts are targeting $5,000 by early 2026, too. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Oracle’s weak outlook added pressure, but analysts say Broadcom’s $73B backlog and soaring custom-chip demand still support multi-quarter AI growth.

Title: Broadcom shares drop premarket despite Q4 earnings beat

Time Published: 2025-12-12T14:20:11Z
Full Content:
Share this article Shares of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) slid in premarket trading on Friday despite the company posting strong quarterly financial results. The stock fell about 5% following a mild dip at market close on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. The tech giant reported record Q4 fiscal 2025 revenue of over $18 billion, led by AI-driven semiconductor growth and a 26% rise in infrastructure software revenue. Broadcom projects Q1 2026 revenue of $19.1 billion, with AI revenue expected to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, supported by a $73 billion backlog. The stock declined after management chose not to update its prior guidance of 40%-60% AI revenue growth for fiscal year 2026. Analysts noted that the decision disappointed stakeholders, despite signs of accelerating AI-driven revenue growth. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Scaramucci predicts ‘exponential opportunity’ for crypto at LONGITUDE
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-cruising-on-tailwinds-into-2026-longitude-recap
Time Published: 2025-12-12T13:34:47Z
Full Content:
The cryptocurrency industry is riding on the tailwinds of regulatory clarity and newfound interest from institutional investors into the new year. Institutional investment and clear-cut regulations are laying the foundation for a strong start to 2026 for the wider cryptocurrency industry. Industry players including Anthony Scaramucci, Kristin Smith, Eli Ben-Sasson, Ian Rodgers, Reeve Collins and Joseph Chalom delivered optimistic outlooks for the new year after a year of positive change, particularly in the United States. Cointelegraph’s latest LONGITUDE event featured panels focused on Solana’s growth, surging interest in privacy protocols and lessons learned from security incidents in 2025. “There’s been a tremendous amount of progress in 2025, an unprecedented amount,” Smith said. The president of the Solana Policy Institute has been intimately involved in crypto-focused discussions in Washington over the past 18 months. Scaramucci said educating policymakers remains a key hurdle to helping the traditional financial system adopt innovative protocols running on blockchain rails. “Kristin has got to go into those rooms, and she’s got to explain to these people why this regulation needs to get passed so that we can retool the financial system and make the system less expensive and more seamless,” Scaramucci said. The founder of SkyBridge Capital added that existing TradFi systems currently spend over $4 trillion on transaction verification globally. Shifting to protocols like Ethereum and Solana, which currently rank highest for RWA tokenization and onchain activity, could offer unrivalled efficiency and cost savings. Again, the major hurdle in recent years has been lagging regulations that have scuppered innovation and the ability for institutions to actively explore using blockchain protocols. “We can do that today. It’s actually fairly easy to issue a share or a bond on a blockchain. The problem is the regulations don’t make sense when it comes to trading those assets. And so that’s a piece that we’re working on,” Smith said. Related: Scaramucci family invested over $100M in Trump’s Bitcoin mining firm: Report Scaramucci delivered a bullish parting message, highlighting the intent of America’s biggest financial institutions, BlackRock, Blackstone and JPMorgan, moving to tokenize assets on blockchain protocols. StarkWare founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who also co-founded the Zcash protocol, engaged in a thought-provoking fireside chat unpacking why privacy protocols have been in vogue in the latter half of 2025. Ben-Sasson weighed in on the massive interest in Zcash (ZEC) in 2025. The privacy-focused cryptocurrency has been around since 2016, but saw a massive surge in value and interest off the back of support from various big names in the industry. “At one extreme, you have the stuff we did at Zcash, which is resistance money level of privacy. If you need to jump on a plane and the government is pursuing you and you need to be fully, you know, off the radar, then you have that,” Ben-Sasson said. However, Ben-Sasson said the cost of that luxury is in the user experience. Wallets, programmability and user experience are harder to provide with that level of privacy. The less technical end of the spectrum affords a use case that is in high demand. Related: Can Zcash’s rise revive the Bitcoin OP_CAT discussion? “Enterprises come in, and they are going to want a different kind of privacy and also a different kind of privacy from the kind that we did on Zcash. They’re going to want privacy where they, as enterprises, and their customers are shielded away from other customers and from their competitors,” he said. Security was another major talking point at LONGITUDE VII, given the spate of high-profile hacks and security incidents in 2025. The theft of $1.6 billion of Ether (ETH) from Bybit in March was a wake-up call for the industry. As Phemex CEO Federico Variola explained, social engineering and unverified access continue to be a major threat to everyday crypto users. “It’s difficult in crypto because sometimes you need to participate in an airdrop, or like you want your Twitter account to be linked to the MegaETH ICO, for example. Nevertheless, you should be aware that you’re always exposing yourself to significant risk,” Variola said. Related: Bybit hack: ‘Reckoning’ that led SafeWallet to rearchitect its systems Ledger’s chief experience officer Ian Rodgers said that the onus is on service providers and infrastructure builders to think critically about the risks their platforms and users face. “There is no way to make a risk go to zero. But it is the responsibility to minimize the risk as much as possible, to think about what is the worst thing that could possibly happen, what could go wrong here,” Rodgers said. Cointelegraph’s exclusive LONGITUDE events will be back on the calendar in 2026, with editions planned for New York, Paris, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Abu Dhabi.

Title: Silver surges past Microsoft — The metal just became the world’s 5th largest asset

Silver surges past Microsoft as its price rockets above $64 and pushes its market value to nearly $3.63 trillion, making it the world’s 5th largest asset. The jump comes from a severe supply squeeze, shrinking inventories, record leasing rates, and massive ETF inflows. Silver is now up almost 150% this year, outpacing every major asset, but analysts warn that any shift in rate-cut bets or macro stress could trigger a fast pullback.

Title: ETFs May Be Blurring the Line Between Gambling and Investing
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/investing-strategies-etf/etfs-may-be-blurring-the-line-between-gambling-and-investing/
Time Published: 2025-12-12T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com To paraphrase a variety of sayings about making money in risky endeavors, the easiest way to get to $1 million is to start with $2 million. Historically, gambling and investing have been handled differently by the average American. The latter, of course, is intended to build wealth over time. But as access to gambling has dramatically expanded in recent years in the US, with sports betting and prediction markets available on anyone’s smartphone, the behaviors and attitudes around it have arguably bled into the investing world. There is now a booming new menu of exchange-traded products that let investors take risky, short-term stances, and that development in the ETF industry has some observers sounding the alarm. “There really are few parallels between investing and gambling, but there are many close parallels between speculation and gambling,” said Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University’s Heider College of Business. “And, unfortunately, the line between speculation and gambling is not only getting blurred, but it is being eliminated.” There are examples in the investing world that resemble speculation or gambling, Johnson said. Those include crypto assets, picking stocks in the electric vehicles market and leveraged ETFs (which in some cases overlap with crypto and EV stocks). “There is no way to value cryptocurrencies other than the greater fool theory — the hope that some greater fool will pay you more than you paid,” he said. “It is the consummate bubble, and investors should stay far away from cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin specifically.” A growing number of asset managers might disagree with that. It’s now common for traditional financial companies to offer access to them. And some firms even recommend small allocations to bitcoin for wealth management clients. The latest company to cave to the crypto craze, Vanguard, allows brokerage clients to buy bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, but it doesn’t include memecoins. It’s also notable that Vanguard doesn’t include leveraged or inverse ETFs on its brokerage platform. Broad market index ETFs are appropriate for most investors, Johnson said. Leveraged ETFs, though, which amplify gains and losses and often reset daily, are not, he noted. Those products are increasing in number and size: Robinhood and other brokerage systems have helped trading skyrocket in popularity, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people were trapped indoors and had an abundance of time on their hands. While stockpicking can be inherently risky, the stakes have been pushed higher with the availability of prediction markets, or yes/no derivative contracts for the outcome of almost any event imaginable. It’s also big business: Still, there are differences in the kinds of information people have and how they use it that can distinguish between gambling and investing, said Valeria Martinez, CEO of Bettingladies.com, an online community of women who bet on sports. “Investors rely on fundamentals and disclosures, while bettors rely on performance data, models and market sentiment,” she said. “Perhaps where the two overlap is in the mindset. People today are simply more used to making probabilistic decisions in all areas of life, whether it’s choosing a stock or picking a team.” A former CFTC enforcement attorney who now defends white-collar clients said risky behaviors that start while gambling can snowball into investing, and at great costs. “Investors who slip into speculative, emotion-driven behavior become far more vulnerable to fraud, market manipulation schemes and high-pressure sales tactics,” said Braden Perry, partner at Kennyhertz Perry. “The behavior that begins as entertainment trading can develop into misuse of margin, unauthorized trading or increasingly desperate attempts to recover losses. Those situations often lead to regulatory investigations or even criminal exposure.” What Could Go Wrong? Even for stocks with net positive returns, leveraged ETFs held for longer than a day can underperform those target stocks because of decay, caused by their daily resets, amplified losses during volatility and fees. But big losses can also happen quickly, as seen during 2020’s extreme volatility, when inverse VIX exchange-traded notes lost nearly all their value and closed, Creighton University’s Johnson said. A more recent example is UK-domiciled GraniteShares 3X Short AMD ETP, which erased its value in a single day in October after Advanced Micro Devices’s stock jumped 38%. “In the hands of amateur investors, leveraged ETFs and ETNs are weapons of mass wealth destruction,” Johnson said. What’s most worrisome to Aaron Randak, founder of Golden Acre Wealth Management, is the great wealth transfer, in which younger generations stand to inherit tens of trillions of dollars from baby boomers. The success stories of a few people in prediction markets might be what younger people most often see, rather than the risks. And that could potentially impact investing behavior down the road. “It could be an overall positive for the world to have these prediction markets, because it shines a light on the major events,” he said. When it comes to investing, leveraged ETFs can be very useful for highly experienced traders and institutional investors, but “the younger investor doesn’t have any clue what research is needed.” After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. Recent developments at Vanguard and Bank of America have boosted momentum for digital assets including bitcoin ETFs. The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. AI and other tech platforms can help ETF issuers identify the best sales prospects among firms in their target markets. Asset managers acknowledge the reality of paying to access Schwab customers, as they have started to do with Fidelity. As active ETFs have exploded, so too has thematic investing, a dangerous trend for most investors, the author of a Morningstar report said. © 2025 The Daily Upside

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implicitly granted approval for some stocks and other securities to be tokenized and traded on blockchains. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the world's largest securities settlement system, said on Thursday that a subsidiary, the Depository Trust Co. (DTC), received a no-action letter allowing it to offer a tokenization service on approved blockchains for three years. Tokenization is the process of representing stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) as digital tokens that can be bought, sold and traded on blockchains, with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and faster settlement. Some of the biggest names in traditional finance (TradFi), including JPMorgan and BlackRock, have developed projects in this area, demonstrating the potential institutional investment that they can draw to blockchain finance. The Depository Trust Co.'s authorization applies to the constituents of the Russell 1000 index, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking major indexes and U.S. Treasuries. It plans to begin rolling out the service in the first half of 2026. A no-action letter is a formal response from the agency to a company stating that the regulator will not take any enforcement action for a proposed activity.

The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to overturn President Trump's executive order ending collective bargaining rights for two-thirds of the federal workforce. The big picture: It's the first time during Trump's second term that the House has secured enough votes to repeal one of his executive orders, though the measure faces an uphill battle as it heads to the GOP-controlled Senate. Federal employee unions have been at the forefront of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce — moves that laid off more than 200,000 federal employees earlier this year and an approximate 4,000 during the nation's longest-ever government shutdown. The administration has argued that restricting union rights is necessary to protect national security, despite many agencies being indirectly linked to those concerns. Driving the news: The House voted 231-195 against Trump's March order, which sought to strip the employees' protections to negotiate for better pay, benefits and fair treatment. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) introduced the Protect America's Workforce Act, which they say would restore union rights for nearly 1 million federal workers. The corresponding Senate bill had 48 original co-sponsors .

Thirteen House Republicans joined Democrats in a 222-200 vote to advance legislation reversing Trump's executive order restricting federal worker unions. Marjorie Taylor Greene is reportedly plotting to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after accusing him of 'hypocrisy' on CNN. Many of us dismiss a rash as “just allergies,” “just dry skin,” or “probably nothing.”. But doctors warn there is one rash that can turn deadly in hours, not days — and Americans rarely recognize it until it’s too late. A bombshell came crashing into the White House health narrative Monday when longtime cardiologist Jonathan Reiner publicly rejected the official spin on President Trump’s recent MRI, calling the explanation “laughable” and suggesting the whole thing smells of secrecy. Despite clearly trying to hide it with makeup, Donald Trump’s hand is covered in a large, dark bruise. Social media users spotted it last week in photos from his State Visit to the UK and are raising concerns about Trump’s health. This isn’t the firs... Grocery shopping used to be pretty straightforward. You'd grab your usual items, pay, and go home without thinking twice about the total.

Business An exterior view of the Oracle Field Office at Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo NEW YORK, Dec 12 : The red-hot trade backing artificial intelligence-related stocks has taken a bruising from back-to-back troubling updates from Oracle and Broadcom, reigniting concerns about frothy valuations and an AI bubble. Still, investors say reasons for optimism about AI remain intact, and many are wary about calling a top. Investors have piled into AI-related companies this year as the technology has taken off, with promises to make Corporate America more efficient. But some investors feel AI-related shares are overvalued. High-profile names such as Michael Burry have been bearish, comparing the recent AI boom to the 1990s dot-com era. For now, however, short-selling has been limited to smaller companies, with few pressing bearish bets against the biggest AI names.

December 12, 2025 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz My end-of-week morning train WFH reads: • Howard Marks: Is It a Bubble? Ours is a remarkable moment in world history. A transformative technology is ascending, and its supporters claim it will forever change the world. To build it requires companies to invest a sum of money unlike anything in living memory. News reports are filled with widespread fears that America’s biggest corporations are propping up a bubble that will soon pop. (Oaktree Capital) • The Collapse of Human Knowledge: And why you should create more in the age of AI.

Title: Dan Ives Says Three Stocks Set for Major Breakouts in 2026, Driven by Monetization of AI

Wall Street veteran and Wedbush Securities’ global head of tech research, Dan Ives, is bullish on three other trillion-dollar company amid a tech rally that he believes has more upside potential. In a new interview on CNBC International, Ives says he believes Apple (AAPL) will surge by at least 25% from the current level, driven by monetization of artificial intelligence (AI) services. “Monetization is going to be key for Apple. The consumer AI revolution runs through Cupertino… [My price target is] $350. But look, I think if they get this right, you could have a four in front of it. I think that’s ultimately where we see Apple heading as this all plays out. Because when you start to put the monetization of AI, and you put numbers together, I think it’s $75 to $100 per share that AI adds to Apple.” Apple is trading at $279 at time of writing. Turning to Microsoft (MSFT), Ives says the Redmond, Washington-based software giant will benefit significantly from the monetization of AI services. “Microsoft, I think we’ve talked about this… this is a 30 – 40% upside from here. I think investors are underestimating just how the penetration story is going to look like when it comes to AI. And I think monetization… …I think no one really benefits more [from monetization of AI] than what we see up in Redmond.” Microsoft is trading at $478 at time of writing. Next up is Alphabet. Ives says he’s very bullish on the year ahead for Google’s parent company amid a “massive turnaround story” with the release of the Gemini 3 large language model. According to Ives, a potential partnership between Alphabet and Apple that would allow the iPhone maker to use the Gemini platform could prove to be “key” for Google’s parent company due to Apple’s wide user base. “Now, it’s all about Google Gemini. That’s going to be a key partnership [with Apple]. Then, ultimately, you’re going to see probably a paid subscription service as they launch into the spring. And you have the biggest install base in the world.” Last month, in an SEC filing, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had acquired a $4.34 billion stake in Alphabet. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s family office also revealed it had bought a $24.85 million stake in Alphabet in the third quarter.

Title: Bitcoin just exposed a terrifying link to the AI bubble that guarantees it crashes first when tech breaks

Oracle's earnings miss and $80B market cap wipeout show how tightly Bitcoin now tracks AI-driven tech risk, but the policy response to a credit crunch could recreate the liquidity conditions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Oracle lost roughly $80 billion in market value on Dec. 11 when revenue missed expectations, and management hiked AI-related capex from $35 billion to about $50 billion, funded in part with rising debt. The stock dropped up to 16%, dragging Nvidia, AMD, and the broader Nasdaq lower. Reports framed the move as fanning “AI bubble” fears, with investors questioning whether the payoff from building massive data-center capacity is arriving fast enough to justify those costs. On the same tape, Bitcoin slipped below $90,000, likely due to worries over the AI sector denting risk appetite. The single-day episode encapsulates Bitcoin's new structural vulnerability: it has become the high-beta tail of the AI trade, moving in lockstep with tech equity sentiment and bleeding harder when AI-linked stocks crack. The correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia reached approximately 0.96 over a rolling three-month window leading into Nvidia's November earnings, according to analysis from 24/7 Wall St. Regarding Nasdaq, The Block data shows that the 30-day aggregate Pearson Correlation coefficient was 0.53 as of Dec. 10. Additionally, Bitcoin is down around 20% since the Fed began easing interest rates on Sept. 17, while the Nasdaq is up 6%. This suggests that when tech stocks crash, Bitcoin tanks harder. The AI bubble narrative has matured rapidly over the past few weeks. Reuters reported in late November that AI-linked valuations and macro gauges such as the Buffett Indicator have pushed overall US equity valuations beyond dot-com-era extremes, while AI-heavy indices show sharp pullbacks and rising volatility even as enthusiasm remains high. Besides, big tech companies have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds this year to finance data centers and hardware. Morgan Stanley estimated a funding gap of around $1.5 trillion for the AI infrastructure build-out, and Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi warned that AI-related borrowing now exceeds tech's run-up before the dot-com crash. Essays in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and The Atlantic both cite roughly $400 billion in AI spending this year against only about $60 billion in revenue. The math implies that most firms are deeply loss-making and that the wider economy is now partly leaning on an AI investment boom that cannot last indefinitely. If the AI bubble bursts, the damage to Bitcoin will go beyond simple correlation, as AI capex increasingly becomes a credit story. Estimates indicated that AI-related data center and infrastructure financing deals jumped from about $15 billion in 2024 to roughly $125 billion in 2025, driven by bond issuance, private credit, and asset-backed securities. Analysts in a Reuters piece compare some of the structures and opacity to pre-2008 patterns and warn of “untested risks” if tenants or cash flows disappoint. Central banks now treat this as a financial-stability problem. The Bank of England's recent stability update explicitly highlights stretched valuations in AI-focused firms. It also warns that a sharp correction in AI-linked equities could threaten broader markets via leveraged players and private-credit exposures. The ECB's November 2025 Financial Stability Review makes a similar point: the AI investment boom is increasingly funded through bond markets and private capital, making it more exposed to swings in risk sentiment and credit spreads. Oracle is the poster child. Its $50 billion capex plan for AI data centers, alongside a roughly 45% jump in long-term debt and record credit-default-swap spreads, represents exactly the sort of over-extended balance sheet regulators worry about. If an AI bubble pops, those spreads widen, refinancing costs jump, and leveraged funds that were long AI-themed debt and equities are forced to cut gross exposure. Bitcoin sits at the end of that chain. Chinese researchers' analysis of Bitcoin versus global liquidity finds a strong positive relationship between Bitcoin prices and global M2 or broad liquidity indices. Their paper called BTC a “liquidity barometer” that performs well when global liquidity is high and poorly when it contracts. The liquidity story is straightforward: if the AI bubble bursts and forces a credit squeeze, the first-order effect is a global de-risking and liquidity pullback. Bitcoin is one of the first things macro and growth funds sell when margin calls come in, and its outsized sensitivity to liquidity makes the drawdown worse. The other half of the story is what happens after the first wave of deleveraging. The same institutions that worry about an AI-driven correction also implicitly point toward the likely response. If over-levered AI and credit markets wobble hard enough to threaten growth, central banks will re-ease financial conditions. The IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report warns that AI-driven equity concentration and stretched risk asset valuations make a “disorderly correction” more likely and stresses the need for careful, but ultimately supportive, monetary policy to avoid amplifying shocks. History gives a template. After the COVID shock in March 2020, aggressive quantitative easing and liquidity provision coincided with a massive rise in total crypto market cap from around $150 billion in early 2020 to roughly $3 trillion by late 2021. A recent Seeking Alpha report mapped Bitcoin against global liquidity and the dollar index shows that, once easing starts in earnest and the dollar weakens, BTC tends to put in large upside moves over the following quarters. The narrative rotation also matters. If AI equities go through a classic post-bubble hangover, with lower multiples, negative headlines, and political backlash over wasted capex, some portion of speculative and macro capital could rotate into a different “future of money” or “anti-system” bet. Bitcoin is the cleanest non-corporate candidate. Recent market stress has already seen capital concentrate back into BTC rather than alts. As liquidity thinned and volatility rose recently, Bitcoin's dominance has climbed to around 57%, with ETFs serving as the institutional on-ramp. Additionally, although Bitcoin has recently shown a correlation with tech stocks, decentralization and scarcity remain the core of the “hedge” narrative. Bitcoin's structural problem is that it cannot decouple from the AI trade in the short term, but it depends on policy responses to an AI bust for its medium-term upside. In the immediate aftermath of an AI credit crunch, Bitcoin bleeds because it is the high-beta tail of macro risk, and global liquidity contracts faster than most assets can adjust. In the months that follow, if central banks respond with renewed easing and the dollar weakens, Bitcoin historically has captured outsized gains as liquidity flows back into risk assets and speculative narratives reset. The question for allocators is whether Bitcoin can survive the first hit well enough to benefit from the second wave. The answer depends on how violent the AI correction is, how quickly policy pivots, and whether institutional flows through ETFs and other vehicles hold or break under stress. Oracle's Dec. 11 earnings miss is a preview: Bitcoin dropped below $90,000 in the same tape that wiped $80 billion off Oracle's market cap, showing that the correlation is live and the sensitivity is real. If the AI bubble fully unwinds, Bitcoin takes the punch first. Whether it emerges stronger depends on what central banks do next. However, one short term positive indicator revealed itself later in yesterday's trading session. Nvidia recovered 1.5% from its intraday low, while Bitcoin followed suit but gained over 3%, reclaiming $92,000.

Title: The year the Big Tech job market cracked

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Mody Khan lost his job at Microsoft last December, he was hopeful he'd bounce back quickly. But the tech job market had other ideas. Now, a year later, he's still looking. Despite a five-year run at Microsoft as a cloud solution architect, he said, even landing interviews has been a struggle. "I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere," said Khan, who is in his 50s and lives in Texas. In the meantime, he's exhausted his rainy day fund and fallen behind on his mortgage payments. He's now worried he could lose his home. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," he said. "I'm in a very tight spot." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than 20 tech professionals for Business Insider stories who, like Khan, were struggling to find work. Many were affected by layoffs intended to right-size overhiring during the pandemic and streamline operations. US tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger, a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. Big Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees. While much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's been cushioned by low levels of firing — but not in tech. The job market has been particularly challenging for tech professionals, who are competing not only with a growing pool of laid-off workers but also with recent college graduates and employed tech professionals looking to switch roles. At the same time, the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and application bots has made it easier for candidates to submit hundreds of applications, overwhelming some employers and making it harder for top applicants to stand out from the crowd. This surge in demand for tech roles has coincided with a decline in the supply of available openings. After peaking in 2022 following a pandemic-era hiring spree, tech job postings on Indeed are down 33% from their levels in early 2020. The roles that remain are taking longer for companies to fill, and, amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. To succeed in the 2025 tech job market, some candidates believe they need to be close to the perfect candidate. As Khan put it, "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman." Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: As the hiring slowdown drags on, some tech professionals are bracing for what might await them in today's job market. In October, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, a move CEO Andy Jassy said was intended to reshape the company's culture. Business Insider spoke with six affected employees about how they were coping with the news. Most began searching for new roles soon after they learned they'd been laid off, in part because they felt the tech job market could be very challenging. John Paul Martinez, formerly a technical support engineer at Amazon, said the prospect of competing with thousands of other laid-off tech workers — from Amazon and beyond — has left him anxious about the search ahead. "I am extremely fearful of the competition," said the 35-year-old, who lives in Orlando. Since 2022, Big Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla have collectively announced layoffs of more than 125,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. The roughly 34,000 layoffs from these companies so far this year — most of them tied to cuts at Amazon and Microsoft — mark a 65% increase over 2024. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for our newsletter. This influx of job seekers has helped fuel intense competition for roles across the economy. Last quarter, the average job opening received 242 applications — nearly triple the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. James Hwang, a former Amazon IT support engineer, said the hiring landscape has been just as tough as advertised. "The current job market has been crazy hard," said the 27-year-old, who lives in Michigan. "I've already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet." For many tech professionals, landing a Big Tech job is the ultimate goal. But in today's market, some have decided to broaden their horizons. After losing his contract role as an engineering program manager at Apple in September 2024, Lee Givens Jr. struggled to find work. Given his prior experience in Big Tech at Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, he initially focused his search on similar companies — but was unable to gain traction. That changed when he stopped limiting his search to Big Tech. In April, he landed a product manager role at a Toyota subsidiary. Givens said his total compensation is significantly higher than it was at Apple — and that he feels he's making more of an impact than he could at a larger tech corporation. After 17 years at Microsoft, Eduardo Noriega was laid off from his senior software engineering role in May. Instead of looking for another Big Tech job, he pivoted full-time to the staffing firm he'd spent nearly a decade building — a business he'd started partly as a cushion in case a layoff ever came. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." However, some workers are still finding ways to land roles at Big Tech companies. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Hendersen was laid off in May from her user researcher role. By October, she was working at Meta as a user experience researcher — a position she landed after receiving a referral from a connection. In June, shortly before graduation, Andrew Chen landed a software engineering role at Amazon. He said posting about his interview prep journey on TikTok helped keep him accountable — and opened the door to advice from others who'd been through the process. While some tech job seekers have managed to break through, many told Business Insider they're still searching for work — both in and outside Big Tech. For those still struggling, the challenge isn't just refining their job search strategy — it's also figuring out how to soften the financial blow of losing a paycheck. After being laid off from his technical program manager position at Microsoft, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he put his belongings in storage and moved to Florida to live with family, hoping to save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." Jump to

Your complete guide on all the latest news and details for the newly announced game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Along with a ton of exciting announcements from the 2025 Game Awards, Tomb Raider: Catalyst was just announced. That's right, folks, after waiting for around about seven years for a new Tomb Raider game, that isn't a remake or remaster, we are finally getting a fresh adventure for Lara Croft. Tomb Raider Catalyst is the second of two new games coming from Crystal Dynamics throughout 2026 and 2027. The first is a "reimagining" of our favorite adventure hunter's debut, with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. However, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is due to release shortly after, and will be the start of a new chapter in the series. As massive fans of all the best Tomb Raider games, we are very excited for Lara's comeback and have gathered all the information that you need to know ahead of the upcoming title's launch. Below you'll find details from the development team, breaking down story information, as well as details on the Tomb Raider: Catalyst release window, confirmed platforms, and more. So if you are ready to dive into what may just be one of the best adventure games on the near horizon, scroll on. Tomb Raider: Catalyst's release date will be heading our way sometime in 2027. This release window was revealed during the 2025 Game Awards, and also came with a snazzy teaser and news that we'd be getting Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis as well. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will be out first, though, as it's set to release in 2026. The game is a reimagining of Lara Croft's debut, so it'll be the perfect experience to pick up if you want to prepare for Lara's new adventure come 2027. We don't have a firm date yet for Tomb Raider: Catalyst. We expect to hear news soon, likely after Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis has been released. We'll keep you posted as more news heads our way, so keep your eyes on this page! Tomb Raider: Catalyst has been confirmed to be landing on PC (via Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S when it releases sometime in 2027. Currently, no Switch 2 releases have been announced; but worry not, Nintendo fans, there is still hope. The Switch 2 does support some games that were developed on Unreal Engine 5, just like Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Games such as Cronos: The New Dawn, Fortnite, and Split Fiction all run on the new hybrid console. So, there is always a chance that Tomb Raider: Catalyst could be added to our list of upcoming Switch 2 games in the future. Stay tuned for updates. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Tomb Raider: Catalyst will be following Lara Croft on a new adventure as she heads to North India after a mystical cataclysm has unleashed ancient secrets and forces that guard them. It's up to the badass treasure hunter to uncover the truth behind the event and also work to stop those who seek to use the mysterious power for their own benefit. The stakes are pretty high in the story, too, since it will be up to you to prevent a full-blown catastrophe that could very well shape the future. Exciting times! While we don't no many story-specific details, we do know the upcoming game is serving as a new chapter in the Tomb Raider franchise. Although it's technically set after the events of the Legend trilogy, you don't need to play those titles or the reboot trilogy either to get up to speed. This timeline information was confirmed to us by Will Kerslake, the Game Director of Crystal Dynamics, during a chat about the future title. "From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld, with the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we’re seeing a more experienced Lara Croft. But what’s important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider," he explained. "So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone." Like past Tomb Raider games, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is a single-player action-adventure game that will have you stepping into the shoes of Lara Croft. This is going to be a story-driven game, with Alix Wilton Regan (from Dragon Age Inquisition, Mass Effect 3, and Cyberpunk 2077 fame) voicing Lara Croft. So expect to see some cinematic moments and get ready to buckle in for a more linear kind of adventure. In a press release for the game, it was also confirmed that players will get to explore the largest Tomb Raider map we've ever had. Along with exploration that is apparently increasing in scale, players can also look forward to diving into tombs that are packed with intricate puzzles to solve. So far, it sounds like everything you'd expect from a Tomb Raider game, just taken up a notch. However, we are still waiting on more gameplay reveals to show us more information on what kind of new mechanics and environmental puzzles will be on offer. Combat details and enemy encounters are also being kept under lock and key currently, so hopefully, we will get more news on those soon. While we wait for more details, you can check out our list of the best action games to play today to keep you busy. Crystal Dynamics has been developing Tomb Raider: Catalyst since 2022, back when its partnership with Amazon Game Studios was first announced. If you need a Tomb Raider refresher, Crystal Dynamics has been making games for the series since 2006's Tomb Raider: Legend. The studio is also known for the Legacy of Kain and Gex series, so in terms of action-adventure outings, the studio is as experienced as you can get. Tomb Raider Catalyst is being developed on Unreal Engine 5, and according to a press release following the upcoming game's official reveal at The Game Awards, Scot Amos, Head of Studio at Crystal Dynamics, has stated that the team is looking to push boundaries and innovate the series, thanks to Amazon Game Studios' support. "Our collaboration with Amazon Game Studios has been truly transformative for these ambitious projects," he writes. "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise. With Tomb Raider: Catalyst, we're crafting our most expansive and innovative Tomb Raider adventure yet." It should be noted that in 2025, Crystal Dynamics had three rounds of layoffs that affected various projects and departments in the studio. But it seems like Tomb Raider is safe from any potential cancellations for now, thanks to a reassuring LinkedIn post shared by the developer in November 2025. The post reads: "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future." We'll keep you posted on any further news that comes our way, but things seem to be on course right now, which is a great sign.

Full Content:
Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Jared Kushner, has approached Marc Rowan’s Apollo Global Management and Henry Kravis’s KKR to assist with post-war reconstruction in Ukraine, The Post has learned. Sources familiar with the matter said Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law who has no formal role in the administration, was in New York City on Wednesday for exploratory discussions with the top asset managers in Manhattan’s swanky Hudson Yards development. Insiders said the 44-year-old held meetings at the offices of both financial giants on how to rebuild the war-torn nation. The talks, which are still at a very early stage and may not come to fruition, came on the same day that he took part in a call with Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The names of the VIP participants were released in a statement by Ukraine’s presidential office that evening. Reps for BlackRock, KKR, Affinity Partners, the Treasury Department, and President Zelensky did not return The Post’s requests for comment. A spokesman for Apollo declined to comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink halted his firm’s own multi-billion-dollar Ukraine Development Fund in July amid uncertainty over how President Trump would try to end the war. But he is set to revive the idea, which would also include involvement from the World Bank, that aimed to drum up some $400 billion in fresh investment. “This is not a huge money maker for whoever does it. They are not going to charge incentive fees. It’s a public service,” one person briefed on the situation added. “But you are going to ingratiate yourself with the president and Mr Kushner,” the source added. “They are going to f–k the Europeans.” Indeed, the move could raise fears amongst Ukraine’s allies in Europe that they will be cut out of any lucrative contracts to rebuild the war-torn country. The Trump administration, via the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), in September pledged $75 million in equity intended to jumpstart the fund’s investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, defense, and related infrastructure in Ukraine. That investment is set to be matched by Kyiv to bring it to an initial combined total of $150 million, but DFC stressed that much of the work would be done by “aligned private sector partners.” Ukrainian government officials, including Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, are set to hold what one source described as “marathon talks” about the US-backed peace proposal this weekend. They will also focus on how to rebuild the nation that has been subjected to a brutal four-year attempt to wipe Ukraine off the map by Russian invaders. Kushner, who is not formally part of the administration, has emerged as a central figure in the process of negotiating a peace settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Alongside Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, he attended five hours of Kremlin talks last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then later discussions with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. Kushner, married to the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, previously played a major role in negotiating a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and has also put forward proposals for reconstruction in Gaza. A key point in plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine has been the establishment of an investment fund for sectors including rare metals – sought by the United States, with Svyrydenko playing a key role in setting it up. Kyiv sent its own revised draft of the now 20-point plan to the White House on Wednesday, according to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Catalyst or Legacy of Atlantis? Choose your Lara If you're staying up all night to watch The Game Awards 2025, follow along with our live coverage. If you want an early night, you can catch up on all the news with our Everything Announced at The Game Awards 2025 roundup. The "future of Tomb Raider" has been dutifully revealed at this year's Geoff Awards, and it turns out the future is half-future, half-past. Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics have announced a pair of Tomb Raider games - Tomb Raider: Catalyst, the next major new instalment in Lara Croft's adventures, and the previously leaked Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, "a fully reimagined version" of Core Design's original Tomb Raider from 1996. Let’s start with Catalyst. It’s been in development at Crystal Dynamics since they partnered with Amazon Game Studios back in 2022, and is set in Northern India following “a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them”. Lara is racing various cackling badniks to claim yet another mighty treasure with the apparent power to reshape the geography underfoot. “As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future,” the press release declares. Here’s a video. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be the “largest Tomb Raider world yet”, with all the forgotten crypts and puzzles one might expect of a game featuring Indiana Jones’s sister from another mother. (Dear precious commenters, please find a way to make that rhyme - it’s 3am here and there is no poetry left in my bloodstream.) It’ll launch in 2027 for PC via Steam. Before that, though, you’ll be able to play Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which is being developed by Crystal and Shadow Warrior devs Flying Wild Hog. This also runs in Unreal Engine 5, and boasts of “new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game”. You’ll once again be hunting for the Scion, another momentous McGuffin that must be kept out of dastardly hands, and yes, the dinosaurs are still in it. Ah, my friend the T-Rex. It has been too long since you last chased me screaming around that cave. Look out for these and other hand-Crofted pseudo-vintage delights via Steam in 2026. Both the Catalyst and Legacy Of Atlantis incarnations of Croft are being voiced by Alix Wilton Regan - aka the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition, also known for roles in Mass Effect 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. It's been a very rough time for Crystal Dynamics this year, with three rounds of layoffs in swift succession. The last of those came in November, when the studio announced that "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" had been let go. Naturally, the press release for Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis paints a rosier picture, with Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos commenting that "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise." As for the remake, Wild Hog CEO Michał Szustak assures that "we’re expanding the universe while staying loyal to what fans have always loved." Time for another volcanic argument about tank controls, I guess. Games aside, Amazon are also working on a TV adaptation of Lara's adventures.

Slated to launch in 2027, the teaser trailer references Lara's struggles across the reboot trilogy, while showing her gearing up and fighting across more ancient ruins and lost civilizations. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the press release touts that Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the series' "largest world yet," bringing more puzzles and mysteries for the intrepid explorer to solve. You can check out the teaser trailer for Tomb Raider: Catalyst below: Before that game arrives though, players will have the opportunity to revisit one of Lara's first outings...well, kinda. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996. Also developed with Unreal Engine 5 and with support from Flying Wild Hog, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is slated to launch in 2026. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, a deal that was struck all the way back in 2022, and both games will be launching across Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC (Steam), and PlayStation 5.It's been a minute since a new Tomb Raider game launched, with Eidos Montreal launching Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018 as the conclusion to the trilogy that began in 2013. Since then, Eidos Montreal and its sister studio Crystal Dynamics have changed hands, leaving Square Enix and being sold to Embracer Group. Unfortunately, in keeping with much of the rest of the gaming industry, Crystal Dynamics has also had multiple rounds of layoffs through 2022.

A wide range of foreign and domestic investors were allotted shares, including the government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Fidelity, Norges Bank, BlackRock, Aberdeen, Wellington, Capital World, J P Morgan Investment Management Inc., Goldman Sachs and Aranda Investments Pte. Limited, according to a circular uploaded on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) website. Domestically, the anchor book also saw participation from the state-owned LIC and top mutual fund houses, such as SBI MF, Nippon India MF, Axis MF, HDFC MF and Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, among others. According to the circular, ICICI Prudential AMC has allotted 1.39 crore shares to 149 funds at ₹2,165 apiece, which is also the higher end of the price band. This anchor allocation comes on the heels of a pre-IPO (initial public offering) funding round, where 26 domestic and foreign investors infused ₹4,815 crore into ICICI Prudential AMC. As part of this transaction, the asset management company undertook a private placement of 2,22,40,841 equity shares at an issue price of ₹2,165 apiece, according to its public announcement on Wednesday. This substantial fundraise drew participation from a diverse set of investors, including Lunate Capital, the Estate of late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, IIFL Asset Management, 360 One Funds, Whiteoak Capital, HCL Capital, and market veterans Manish Chokani and Madhusudan Kela. Alongside external investors, the ICICI Bank itself invested ₹2,140 crore to acquire an additional 2 per cent stake in the asset management company. With the anchor round completed, the company is now gearing up for its ₹10,602-crore maiden public offering, which will open on December 12 and close on December 16. ICICI Prudential AMC has set a price band of ₹2,061 to ₹2,165 per share for the issue, valuing the company at about ₹1.07 lakh crore ($11.86 billion). The IPO will be an entirely offer-for-sale (OFS) of more than 4.89 crore shares by its promoter, UK-based Prudential Corporation Holdings, meaning the company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Currently, the ICICI Bank holds 51 per cent in the AMC, while Prudential owns the remaining 49 per cent. Once listed, ICICI Prudential AMC will become the latest asset manager to debut on Indian stock exchanges, joining players such as HDFC AMC, UTI AMC, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Shriram AMC and Nippon Life India Asset Management. It will also be the fifth ICICI Group entity to be listed, after ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life, ICICI Lombard and ICICI Securities. The company is scheduled to make its stock market debut on December 19. Published on December 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-600-rally-in-2026-if-this-support-holds/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the start-of-week momentum slows, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 5.5% on the daily timeframe, falling to the recent lows once again. Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart. After the recent price action, the “price has been slowly bleeding inside this structure and now potentially forming a nice rounded bottom. If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Tech stocks tumble amid renewed AI worries on Wall Street
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/corporations/tech-stocks-oracle-nvidia-rcna248682
Time Published: 2025-12-11T22:55:51Z

DEVELOPING: Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead in their home, source says news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As tech companies push the stock market to record highs, fears of an artificial intelligence bubble continue to simmer on Wall Street, where even a slight earnings miss threatens to upend high-flying stocks. On Thursday, Oracle was the latest company to experience that firsthand. Oracle shares closed down nearly 11% on Thursday after the company announced revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates. That wiped nearly $70 billion off the company's market value in a matter of hours. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the only major index to close lower, because of tremors in the market made by Oracle. The S&P 500 ended the day at a record high, as did the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. Oracle also announced Wednesday night that its spending for fiscal 2026 would be $15 billion more than its estimate in September. The company's total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 are set to be $50 billion. Many of those expenses will be driven by contracts with the likes of Meta and Nvidia, Oracle said. It also said it had a backlog of signed contracts with customers worth $523 billion. Long known for dull back-office software systems, Oracle this year found a renewed purpose as a provider of cloud computing services for the AI boom. But Oracle's share-price drop Thursday had a ripple effect on other top AI stocks for most of the day. Nvidia shares dropped almost 1.5%, while chipmakers Arm Holdings and Intel slid more than 3%. Google owner Alphabet dropped 2.4%. Data center operator CoreWeave and other chipmakers, like AMD and Micron, also dipped into the red. As Oracle's spending rises on the back of AI deals — which some consider "circular" — the company's credit default swaps have soared. The swaps, or CDSes, can be a proxy to gauge how risky a company's bonds or debt are. After Oracle's earnings report Wednesday, they soared to the highest level since 2009, according to Bloomberg, which cited data from the exchange operator ICE. Oracle's credit default swaps have become a closely tracked measure among investors and a barometer for the state of the AI industry overall. On Wednesday night's call, Oracle's principal financial officer, Doug Kehring, said the company is "committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating." "Investment grade" is a rating given to a company's bonds or credit on a sliding scale. Anything below investment-grade is considered speculative, also often referred to as junk. Earlier Thursday, Oracle declined as much as 16.5%, which would have put it on track for its worst one-day performance since 2001. With the S&P 500 up more than 16% and the Nasdaq Composite up more than 20% for the year, the market broadly remains in good shape. Still, the nature and the size of the AI deals — and their uncertain returns — are leading some to question whether the investment boom portends an upcoming bust. Part of those valuations comes from an increasingly complex, interconnected web of deals as AI companies invest in one another. Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI have all announced various investment deals worth tens of billions. In September, chipmaker Nvidia announced a deal to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. But Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said this month that "we still haven't completed a definitive agreement, but we're working with them." The comments underscored how much distance there is between a splashy investment announcement and a binding contractual obligation. At the same time Oracle's shares decline, so do the fortunes of the company's majority shareholder, Larry Ellison. Ellison, ranked as the world's second-richest person by Bloomberg Billionaires, has a fortune worth more than $280 billion. Ellison's son, David, is making a hostile $108 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, trying to upend an agreement Warner Bros. already has to sell its movie studios and HBO to streaming giant Netflix. David Ellison is backstopping his bid with the family's fortune, which rests in large part on shares of Oracle. Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: Rocket Lab’s $554M Revenue Dwarfs AST SpaceMobile’s $18M Despite Identical $30B Valuations

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Shares of AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) and Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) are drawing intense retail attention in December, with both space stocks registering neutral sentiment scores of 53 as of this morning. That marks a significant cooldown from early December, when AST SpaceMobile held sentiment scores consistently above 88 through December 7-8, while Rocket Lab hovered in the 78-82 range. The convergence tells a story of shifting retail conviction as both stocks navigate similar market caps near $30 billion but wildly different operational realities. AST SpaceMobile dominated social sentiment through early December, averaging 82.5 across the seven-day period compared to Rocket Lab’s 70.5. The enthusiasm centered on the company’s satellite constellation plans, with retail traders on r/stocks and r/investing repeatedly naming ASTS among their top growth picks for 2026. One commenter on the r/stocks thread noted: “ASTS is one of the most exciting growth opportunities heading into 2026.” But the fundamentals paint a different picture. AST SpaceMobile missed Q3 estimates by 114%, reporting a loss of $0.45 per share against expectations of $0.21. Revenue of $14.74M fell short of the $20.33M estimate, and the company trades at 1,567x price-to-sales. The stock carries a 2.76 beta. Despite $1.2B in cash and over $1B in contracted revenue commitments, the path to profitability remains distant as the company targets 45-60 satellites by end of 2026. Rocket Lab presents a stark operational contrast. The company beat Q3 estimates by 71%, posting a loss of just $0.03 per share against expectations of $0.1045, while revenue of $155.08M topped estimates and grew 48% year-over-year. With 17 Electron launch contracts secured (a record) and gross margins hitting 37%, Rocket Lab demonstrates consistent execution. The company’s price-to-sales ratio of 55x, while elevated, sits far below AST SpaceMobile’s extreme valuation. Reddit discussions reflect this operational maturity. On r/wallstreetbets, one trader laid out the bull case: “Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years […] it gives you rocket fuel for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years.” The upcoming Neutron launch, expected in Q1 2026, represents a potential inflection point that could unlock Department of Defense contracts worth hundreds of millions. Both stocks trade with similar market caps and high volatility, but Rocket Lab generates 30x more revenue ($554.5M vs $18.5M) while maintaining better profitability metrics. Institutional investors recognize this, with 58% ownership in RKLB compared to 39% for ASTS. As sentiment converges at neutral levels, the divergence in fundamentals becomes impossible to ignore.

Title: Pandemic Horde is Shutting Down, Key Corps to Fold into The Initiative
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/12/11/pandemic-horde-is-shutting-down-key-corps-to-fold-into-the-initiative/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T21:15:51Z
Full Content:
The word out this morning is Pandemic Horde is giving up on whatever plans they may have had and are shutting down, with the remaining central corporations in the alliance, Blessed Beans, Horde Vanguard, Horde Armada, and Coolbeans, joining The Initiative. The announcement on Discord, as posted on Reddit. The closure announcement For those unable to read the tiny text, this is a transcription of the announcement: Johnny Trousersnake – 20:05 @everyone Update Hello friends. Last month we announced a plan to leave coalitions behind and work towards being an independent entity. They say plans never survive contact with the enemy, and as you know, ours didn’t survive the ping. There has been a lot of uncertainty since then – and people want a long-term home, and more space to live and play in. An extended stay in purgatory while attempting a rebuild and navigating today’s political landscape is something we no longer feel is feasible, nor would it be in our players’ best interests. With that in mind, we will be shuttering Pandemic Horde and closing the Alliance. We have been in contact with your CEOs over the past week to discuss this. Several Corporations, including the core of Bless, Armada, Cool Beans and VG will be joining INIT, with others following their own paths. I want to re-assure everyone that regardless of destination, standings and docking access will be maintained for all Corporations during this transition. This will not be a repeat of last month. We’d also like to address asset safety costs which has been a constant pain point for everyone. In just a moment, we’re going to assign every member of every ESI corp that stuck with us over the past month, enough Gobloons to withdraw the most expensive ship from each Dronelands doctrine from asset safety. We hope this helps out. Asset Safety Gobloons were assigned to your ‘main’ on Square. If you do not see them, please double check all of your characters. If you think you may have been missed, please contact one of these names on Discord and specify your character name: [names omitted] Gobloons are the SRP currency used by Pandemic Horde. Participation in operations earns them and you can cash them in for ISK for ship loss reimbursement. Or that is my understanding of the mechanism. So they will be issuing Gabloons to members to convert to ISK to help them get their most expensive hull out of asset safety. Given that asset safety jumped from around 2.5 trillion ISK every month to 19.5 trillion ISK in November, according to the November MER, those Gabloons are probably not going to stretch very far. Back on October 11th of this year Pandemic Horde had 48K capsuleers in its ranks and held 414 systems, making in the second largest alliance in null sec. Top 10 Sov Holding Alliances by Member Count – Oct 11 Then came the collapse, the botched evacuation from the Drone regions, the betrayal of long time allies, and the lack of any real plan for the future, during which two thirds of its members left or were kicked from the alliance. Pandemic Horde Collapse charts – Dec 11, 2025 Even then, sitting with around 16K members, it could have been a power in null sec. But that requires competent and motivated leadership, something the alliance has lacked for some time now. 16K well led pilots can carve out space to live in null sec. 16K capsuleers without leadership are just an aimless mob that will accomplish nothing. So it goes. The Initiative had previously accepted some corporations from Pandemic Horde during the collapse, and offered some temporary space Cloud Ring to what remained of the alliance in order to figure out what to do next. That wasn’t supposed to be a permanent situation, but with a leaderless alliance sleeping on your couch with no hope of survival on its own at this point, I suppose the answer was to either drive them out with a stick or take in the refugees on a more permanent basis. It isn’t often you see an alliance collapse. With even a semblance of a core and some leadership, alliances in much worse positions have come back. TEST has been driven out of its space a few times now and is still lurking… safely under the protective wing of Fraternity to be sure, but they are still around. This move will bulk up The Initiative by nearly 4K more pilots. The remaining 12K pilots left in the alliance… which includes the spy ridden Pandemic Horde Inc and its 8K members, half of what remained of the alliance… will need to figure out their own path. Long time members might be accepted into the four corporations that are merging into The Initiative. And The Initiative may take some additional corps. They already have 24, what difference would a few more make at this point? I listened to some of the town hall they had for the announcement. The message itself was pretty terse, limited pretty much to what was in the written announcement. Most of the 45 minutes was Q&A about what to do next. I am sure it was pretty dejecting for line members, one more indignity on top of almost two months of such failings. I have been covering my own interaction with events in a series of posts if you want some more back story. What happens next remains to be seen. The closure plan is set to be completed almost immediately according to the town hall. At least the whole thing will be commemorated in an special item that you can find as part of the Winter Nexus event. Gone but never forgotten now… Meanwhile, while The Initiative has always been a strong group, part of their strength has been their agility. They are now in the same weight class as their current opponent, Fraternity. Whether the additional pilots help them in their campaign or if their integration into the organization becomes a burden remains to be seen. Related: Huh.. I guess we won. I’m gonna go ahead and still say “we” despite not having played the game in 6 years. LikeLike Good riddance to unironic trash. LikeLike I agree with good riddance. An empire that exists to collect rent and retreat from the enemy deserves to go away. Blah, blah, blah, it’s bad for the members, it’s just a game and they’ll get over it and move on. The biggest downside is the more-than-usual moaning and hand wringing about the mythical blue donut that has been about to ruin nullsec for the last 15 years and This One Event is going to make it real This Time. Again. It’s the second most tired trope after “Eve is dying.” LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

The latest survey from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School shows that Americans aged 18 to 29 are deeply concerned about their future and skeptical that their leaders can solve the country’s growing problems, according to The Washington Post. This pessimism for the future also comes as the American youth are becoming increasingly radicalized, contributing to an uptick in left-wing political violence. Generation Z’s concerns are rooted in the difficult economic reality facing the US, according to the newspaper, which published the study’s data and conclusions on December 7. More than 40% of those surveyed reported financially “struggling” or “just getting by.” The high cost of housing, food prices, and a sluggish job market, marked by mass layoffs in various industries, are central themes in their daily conversations and lives. In this context, only a minority of the young people surveyed said the country is headed in the right direction, which, according to the poll, reflects the sense of instability felt by Generation Z in the US. The main message from this data is that the institutions and systems that should support them are not responding to their needs, generating widespread fear about what the future holds, the report adds. A key factor driving these economic fears is the pessimistic perception of Artificial Intelligence. The majority of young Americans see AI as a direct threat to their job prospects. A significant number even believe this technology will reduce their future employment opportunities. A Wall Street Journal report in October found that the US job market is becoming less welcoming due to a wave of layoffs primarily driven by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies like Amazon, which plans to eliminate up to 10% of its corporate workforce, United Parcel Service (UPS), which has cut nearly 14,000 managerial positions, and Target, which laid off 1,800 employees, mainly due to increasing adoption of AI, are sending experienced and young workers into a stagnant labor market. In addition to technology, investors are pressuring executive management to operate more efficiently and with fewer staff, which, along with trade uncertainty caused by tariff policy and higher costs, is contributing to the slowdown in hiring. The result is a precarious outlook for youth and regular workers, with fewer opportunities for well-paying jobs that support families and fund retirements. The Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School’s survey also underscores a marked distrust of institutions of power. Generation Z distrusts the federal government and Congress, as well as the two major political parties. When asked to summarize the parties in one word, the most common term used to describe Democrats was “weak,” while for Republicans it was “corrupt.” This negative view is indicative of a deep disenchantment with the ruling class. Approval ratings for the current Republican administration and lawmakers from both parties remained below 30%. A majority also disapproved of the Trump administration’s handling of the economy and the US healthcare system, which is characterized by its high fees. In a Fox News poll, the majority of voters said Trump’s economy had hurt them, and three-quarters of Americans said their grocery costs had gone up in the past year, according to polling from Marquette University Law School. Just 26% said Trump was doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Amid the economic problems, favorable views of Trump’s job performance have dropped by 14 percentage points, according to The New York Times’ polling average. Responding to the New York Times’ polling, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the administration was working to “deliver economic relief for the American people, from signing historic drug pricing deals to securing working-class tax cuts.” “More work remains,” he added, “but Americans can rest assured that the same policies that created a historic economy in President Trump’s first term are set to repeat the success in his second term.” Disillusionment extends to the economic system as well. According to the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School survey, support for capitalism has declined, reversing a rebound seen in 2020, and although most said they reject political violence, which has dominated the country’s news since the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, almost 40% of those surveyed consider it “acceptable under certain circumstances,” reflecting a growing radicalization among citizens in the face of political polarization. Although left-wing political violence and incidents averaged 0.6 annually from 1994 to 2000 and doubled to 1.3 over the following decade, numbers began to grow substantially in 2016, at the height of the culture wars and when Trump was first elected. From 2016 to 2024, they averaged 4.0 a year, while this year is set to break records, demonstrating how increasingly radicalized American youth are amid serious economic problems and distrust in politicians. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Oracle shares fall 14% on increase in data centre spending

Oracle stock slumped after it reported disappointing revenues on Wednesday alongside a $15 billion (€12.8 billion) increase in its planned spending on data centres this year to serve artificial intelligence groups. Shares in Larry Ellison’s database company fell 14 per cent on Thursday. The move came as Oracle reported revenues of $16.1 billion in the last quarter, up 14 per cent from the previous year but below analysts’ estimates. Oracle raised its forecast for capital expenditure this financial year by more than 40 per cent to $50 billion. The outlay, largely directed to building data centres, climbed to $12 billion in the quarter, above expectations of $8.4 billion. Its long-term debt including operating leases increased to $116.3 billion, up 44 per cent from a year ago. Oracle has launched an aggressive drive to catch up with much larger cloud players such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in the race to supply the vast amount of computing power that AI groups including OpenAI and Anthropic need to train and run their models. [ Oracle’s share price surge suggests the AI trade still has momentumOpens in new window ] Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s co-chief executive, said its cloud contracts would “quickly add revenue and margin to our infrastructure business” as he defended the vast investments. Yet the company said it expected full-year revenues to remain unchanged from its previous forecast of $67 billion. It expected to generate $4 billion more in revenue the following fiscal year. Total bookings for future revenue, known as remaining performance obligations, rose 15 per cent to $523 billion in the three months to the end of November, supported by deals with Meta and Nvidia. Investors initially welcomed the push into AI from Oracle. Shares surged after its last earnings in September when it disclosed it had added more than $300 billion in bookings, largely driven by data centre contracts with OpenAI. But the stock has given up its gains since then as investors worry about the large amounts Oracle will have to borrow and spend on infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker — and concerns over the start-up’s ability to pay for these contracts in the years ahead. Debt investors have also soured on the company. Oracle’s Big Tech rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have helped reassure investors about their large capital investments by posting strong earnings from their vast cloud units. But in the last quarter, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, which includes its data centres, posted worse than expected revenues of $4.1 billion. Ellison’s company is also relying more heavily on debt to fuel its expansion. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Your monthly donation keeps PBS News strong Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remain in the same historically healthy range of the past few years despite growing concern over the health of the labor market. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000 new applications. READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here’s what experts say they mean The previous week’s figure, analysts say, was distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Despite what on the surface appears to be a historically healthy job market, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. While government data shows that the economy has added a sluggish 40,000 jobs a month since April, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. That would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of 20,000 jobs a month since the spring. “It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell told reporters. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.” Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite some high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. WATCH: 3 things to know about AI and mass corporate layoffs The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April, but some analysts said the plunge is due to a variety of factors, including seasonal adjustments and the fact that most people aren’t eligible for benefits after 26 weeks. The Labor Department’s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750.

Title: Top 5 Stocks Impacted by Potential Armed Conflict With Venezuela

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The United States has assembled its largest military presence in the Caribbean since 1989, with more than 15,000 troops deployed near Venezuela. Following the December 10 seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker and ongoing strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, $36 million in trading volume on prediction markets tracking US-Venezuela military engagement signals serious investor concern about potential armed conflict. A military confrontation would create immediate winners and losers across defense and energy sectors. Defense contractors would benefit from increased equipment demand and contract expansions, while energy companies face initial oil price spikes followed by potential long-term supply increases if regime change occurs. Let me be clear, I don’t want a conflict here. But part of my job is to help inform you how global events connect to your financial well-being, and that’s what I’m going to show you below. Lockheed Martin stands as the primary beneficiary of any Venezuela military engagement. The company’s $109.2 billion market cap and specialization in precision strike missiles, military aircraft, and missile defense systems position it directly for contract expansions during regional conflicts. LMT beat Q3 2025 earnings estimates by 9.45%, delivering $6.95 per share against expectations of $6.35. Revenue reached $18.61 billion with an 11.7% operating margin. The company has beaten earnings in seven of the last eight quarters with an average surprise of 8.9%. LMT’s forward P/E of 15 compared to its trailing 26.1 suggests analysts expect significant earnings acceleration. The stock trades at $467, roughly 3% below its year-to-date high of $482. Wall Street maintains four Strong Buy and four Buy ratings, setting a $527 price target that implies 13% upside. Any Caribbean military operation would likely involve LMT’s F-35 fighters, Aegis missile defense systems, and precision munitions. The company’s extremely low beta of 0.241 provides defensive characteristics while offering conflict-related upside. RTX’s integrated defense portfolio makes it the second-most exposed defense contractor. The company’s $234.3 billion market cap reflects diversified revenue streams across Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and the Raytheon defense segment. Q3 2025 results showcased exceptional momentum: revenue of $22.48 billion beat estimates of $21.32 billion by 5.4%, while EPS of $1.70 exceeded expectations of $1.41. The Raytheon segment posted $7.05 billion in sales, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow reached $4.64 billion with a $251 billion backlog providing multi-year revenue visibility. RTX raised full-year 2025 guidance to $86.5-87.0 billion in sales with EPS of $6.10-6.20. The company’s 29.4% quarterly earnings growth year-over-year significantly outpaces LMT’s 2.2%, though it commands a premium valuation at 35.9x trailing P/E. The company’s missile systems, including air defense and precision strike capabilities, would be central to any Caribbean operations. Analysts maintain four Strong Buy and nine Buy ratings with zero Sell ratings. Northrop Grumman’s $79.52 billion market cap and specialization in autonomous systems, C4ISR, and space-based assets provide unique exposure to modern conflict scenarios requiring advanced technology integration. Q3 2025 results showed mixed performance: revenue of $10.42 billion missed estimates of $10.82 billion, but EPS of $7.67 beat expectations of $6.52 by 17.7%. The company demonstrated strong operational efficiency with a 13.2% operating margin and free cash flow of $1.26 billion, up 72% year-over-year. Management raised 2025 EPS guidance to $25.65-26.05. The Mission Systems segment generated $3.09 billion in Q3 (up 10%), and Defense Systems reached $2.06 billion (up 14%). NOC’s unmanned systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated battle management systems would support intelligence gathering and precision strike operations near Venezuela. The company’s higher operating margin of 13.2% compared to LMT’s 11.7% demonstrates superior operational leverage. Exxon Mobil represents the most compelling energy play for Venezuela conflict scenarios, though with complex risk dynamics. The $509.6 billion energy giant would face immediate headwinds from supply disruptions but potential long-term benefits if regime change enables sanctions relief and field access. Analysts project an immediate oil price spike from current levels near $59 per barrel toward $70-75 if conflict disrupts Venezuela’s 900,000 barrels per day of exports. XOM’s massive scale, producing revenues of $326.2 billion over the trailing twelve months, positions it to capture significant margin expansion from price increases. The company’s 9.18% profit margin would expand meaningfully with crude prices 20-25% higher. Q3 2025 results showed cyclical headwinds: quarterly earnings declined 8.3% year-over-year and revenue fell 5.1% as oil prices retreated from summer highs of $75.89 in June to current levels around $59. Venezuela holds over 300 billion barrels of proven reserves, 17% of the global total. If U.S. intervention leads to regime change and sanctions relief, XOM could potentially access Venezuelan heavy crude fields. The company’s Gulf Coast refineries are specifically calibrated for Venezuelan heavy crude. However, this supply increase could eventually pressure prices lower. XOM’s 3.35% dividend yield provides income stability, while its forward P/E of 16.1 suggests reasonable valuation. Chevron’s unique position as the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela under sanctions waivers makes it the most directly exposed energy stock to conflict scenarios. The company’s $305.06 billion market cap and existing Venezuelan operations create both immediate risks and potential opportunities. Q3 2025 results showed production strength offsetting price pressures: revenue of $49.73 billion met estimates while EPS of $1.85 beat expectations of $1.73. Adjusted earnings of $3.6 billion declined from $4.5 billion year-over-year due to lower crude prices, but production surged 21% to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day following Hess acquisition integration. Armed conflict would immediately threaten CVX’s Venezuelan operations and personnel. However, the company’s existing infrastructure and relationships position it as the primary beneficiary if regime change enables expanded operations. CVX’s 6.77% profit margin and 4.55% dividend yield, the highest among covered stocks, provide some downside protection. The $36 million trading volume on Polymarket’s Venezuela military engagement contracts, with $16.5 million traded in the past week alone, indicates sophisticated investors are seriously pricing conflict risk. Defense contractors present clearer upside scenarios with limited downside. All three companies have raised 2025 guidance, maintain substantial backlogs, and demonstrate consistent execution. The sector’s defensive characteristics, evidenced by LMT’s 0.241 beta, provide portfolio stability while offering conflict-related catalysts. Energy stocks face more complex dynamics. Initial conflict would spike oil prices from depressed $59 levels toward $70-75, benefiting all producers. However, successful regime change could eventually increase global supply by 1 million barrels per day over a decade, pressuring prices lower. Defense stocks present asymmetric risk-reward characteristics: limited downside given strong fundamentals and significant upside if conflict escalates. Energy stocks present more complex positioning dynamics, with short-term tactical opportunities during price spikes but longer-term supply concerns if regime change succeeds.

Oracle said new agreements with AI heavyweights Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) helped grow its backlog to a record $523 billion, though that failed to sway investors from selling off Thursday amid persistent worries about circular AI deals and the company's reliance on a few large customers. Shares of Oracle were down nearly 14% in recent trading. AI hardware makers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Broadcom (AVGO)—which is set to report earnings after the closing bell today—also lost ground. Oracle shares rallied to a record high following its earnings report in September, but the stock has given up those gains in the months since amid growing worries about an AI bubble. Oracle's stock plunge Thursday despite a record backlog and pressure on other AI-exposed stocks could be taken as a signal of weakening confidence in the AI trade. Still, most Wall Street analysts say they're standing by Oracle's stock. Though ratings are still in flux, a majority of the 12 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha consider the stock a "buy" with just three neutral ratings and one analyst advising selling the stock. William Blair analysts wrote following the report that while they expect Oracle's stock could be limited in the near term by debt concerns and spending plans, they believe its buildout "will pave the way for significant earnings growth in the years to come."

Title: Steve Ballmer’s Net Worth Up $20 Billion on Microsoft’s Success

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Francois Durand / Getty Images News via Getty Images Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), has a net worth of $166 billion, up $20 billion this year. That makes him the eighth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire list. The secret of the rise is simple. Ballmer kept a large portion of his shares in Microsoft when he left the company in 2014. At the time, he had been the chief executive officer for 14 years. He was also one of the first people Bill Gates hired after he started the company. Today, Ballmer owns 4% of Microsoft, which makes him the company’s largest individual shareholder. Microsoft has a market value of $3.56 trillion. That makes it the fourth most valuable company in the world, just behind Alphabet and ahead of Amazon. The huge increase in Ballmer’s net worth is due largely to Microsoft’s stock being up 124% in the past five years. The S&P 500 is 88% higher in the same period. A much smaller portion of Ballmer’s net worth is based on his ownership of the L.A. Clippers. He bought the team for $2 billion in 2014. According to Forbes, the team is worth $7.5 billion today. Finally, Ballmer gets $1 billion in dividends each year from Microsoft holdings. The forward yield is only 0.76%, but he owns 333 million shares.

Title: Bitcoin and equity futures fall alongside mining stocks as Oracle leads AI stock decline

Cryptocurrency prices and equity futures retreated on Thursday morning, signaling a negative start for major indices. Bitcoin fell 2.11% to $90,090, setting a bearish tone for digital asset miners, while a sharp decline in Oracle shares weighed heavily on the broader AI sector. Bitcoin mining equities tracked the drop in spot cryptocurrency prices, facing widespread losses in pre-market trading. CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) and Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) led the decline, falling 3.03% and 3.19%, respectively. MARA (NASDAQ: MARA) dropped 2.6%, while TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF) and IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) posted losses of roughly 2.5% each. Other industry participants followed the sector-wide sell-off. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) dropped 2.38%, Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) declined 2.02%, and Americant Bitcoin (Nasdaq: ABTC) fell 1.04%. Artificial intelligence stocks faced significant selling pressure, driven primarily by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), which plummeted 13.18%. A Reuters report on December 11 revealed that the sell-off came after Oracle’s quarterly cloud revenue miss, despite year-over-year growth. Compounding investor concerns, the company raised its capital expenditure outlook to $50 billion for 2026 to fund AI infrastructure, a move market observers noted would add to an existing debt load. The negative sentiment impacted other AI leaders, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) falling 1.59%. Oracle also highlighted reliance on a limited number of large partners, such as OpenAI, raising concerns regarding concentration risk. The weakness in tech and crypto dragged down broader market futures. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.32% and Nasdaq futures decreased 0.52% in early trading hours, positioning the markets for a lower open.

Title: Biggest Themes For Broadcom Heading Into Earnings

Live Blog Update #5 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26.

Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space.

If you’re looking for a trusted source for discovering new AI stock ideas – and getting updates on stocks like Broadcom – look no further than the AI Investor Podcast. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Nvidia’s ‘Secret Portfolio’ Is Tanking. This Is the Only Stock Still Winning

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / rafapress Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quietly built a strategic investment portfolio not many investors are aware of targeting companies that enhance its AI ecosystem, from chip design to data infrastructure. This “secret” portfolio holds six positions that were valued at $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. These stakes back firms developing complementary technologies, such as GPU-optimized cloud services and AI-driven biotech. However, Q3 brought challenges amid a broader AI market pause, with hyperscalers reassessing capex and investor sentiment cooling. The portfolio shed nearly $500 million in the quarter, an 11% drop, as four of six holdings declined, most sharply. Since Q3 ended in September, though, the slide deepened, with the overall value plunging 30% more to about $2.7 billion — a $1.1 billion loss. Only one holding defied the trend: Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD). Nvidia’s portfolio woes stem largely from its largest bet, the AI cloud provider reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for training large models, CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV). At Q2’s close, Nvidia’s 24.3 million shares were worth $3.96 billion, over 91% of the portfolio. But CoreWeave’s stock has cratered amid debt concerns and AI hype fatigue. Since Q3’s end, it’s down 36%, and 46% from Q2 levels, now trading around $88 per share after peaking at $187 earlier in 2025. This single position accounts for most of the portfolio’s quarter-over-quarter decline. Other holdings fared little better. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), a chip architecture designer, slipped 12.5% since Q3 amid slower mobile demand. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX), using AI for drug discovery, dropped 5.7% on clinical trial delays, and WeRide (NASDAQ:WRD), an autonomous driving firm, fell 17% as regulatory hurdles mounted. The portfolio’s diversification into AI adjacencies hasn’t shielded it from sector-wide pressures like rising energy costs and delayed enterprise rollouts. Amid the rubble, two positions posted gains, with Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) delivering solid returns. Formerly tied to former Russian search giant Yandex, Nebius now builds AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters. Nvidia’s 1.2 million shares, valued at $65.9 million at the end of Q2, have surged 69% since then, boosted by a $17 billion Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) deal for cloud capacity. Nebius’s Q3 revenue jumped 355% year-over-year to $146 million, underscoring its switch to AI hyperscaler needs. However, the stock has fallen 17% since the end of Q3. Yet Applied Digital outpaces even Nebius as the portfolio’s undisputed star. Nvidia’s 7.7 million shares, worth $77.7 million at Q2 close, have rocketed 128% quarter-over-quarter and another 35% since Q3, for a staggering 208% total gain. Now valued at over $239 million, this stake has single-handedly offset some broader losses. Applied Digital designs and operates data centers tailored for high-performance computing, powering AI and blockchain workloads. Its Polaris Forge campus in North Dakota delivers 100 megawatts of capacity, drawing clients like CoreWeave for GPU-intensive builds. In a market where AI stocks like CoreWeave and even Arm are falling, sometimes as much as 40% or more, Applied Digital’s ability to keep going stands out. Its fiscal Q1 2026 results, reported in October, crushed Wall Street estimates. Revenue hit $64.2 million, up 84% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA at $5.85 million. Net losses narrowed to $36.1 million, far better than feared. The main driver was relentless data center demand. AI training requires massive, power-efficient facilities, and Applied Digital benefits directly from hyperscaler buildouts, including contracts with CoreWeave for colocation. Its sustainable designs, using renewable energy, align with ESG mandates that pressure rivals. Crypto also added tailwinds. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) demand spiked after the halving, especially as its price briefly soared above $126,000, contributing to increased demand for data center capacity. As pure AI plays pause amid valuation resets, Applied Digital’s hybrid model — 60% high-performance computing and AI, 40% crypto — provides a buffer. Analysts project 28% EBITDA growth in fiscal 2026, with $16 billion in existing five-year leases, giving it good visibility into revenue for the years ahead. Trading at 30x forward sales, it’s carrying a lot of investor expectations with it. Although Applied Digital is still generating losses, they narrowed significantly in Q3 and it projects an annual net operating income run rate of $1 billion by 2030. Applied Digital’s outperformance is the result of focused execution. However, its continued success depends on navigating the AI slowdown, potentially crimping data center leases if clients like Microsoft trim budgets. The crypto winter could bite as well, as Bitcoin’s near-30% pullback echoes 2022’s bear market, possibly idling mining rigs and pressuring margins. Still, the upside potential outweighs risks. Nvidia’s endorsement validates its tech, so if AI capex continues strong next year — as Nvidia forecasts it will — Applied Digital could double again. However, having tripled in six months, it’s no secret anymore: in Nvidia’s tanking portfolio, this is the winner worth watching. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Reports suggests "a dozen" employees have been made redundant from Guildford-based studio Around "a dozen" employees at Glowmade are reportedly facing layoffs. That's according to Insider Gaming, which has seen documentation suggesting that the launch of the studio's title King of Meat "failed to meet internal expectations by a significant margin." Sources claim leadership at the Guildford-based developer expected "a concurrent player count of at least 100,000" for the game on Steam, but it "failed to hit 1,000 consistently across all platforms" with a concurrent player peak of 320 on SteamDB. As a result, the studio reportedly "began discussions with staff about voluntary redundancies earlier this month, affecting around a dozen people." GamesIndustry.biz has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment. Glowmade was founded in 2015 by three developers from Lionhead Studios. In 2021, the independent studio partnered with Amazon Game Studios as part of its expansion into third-party publishing. Amazon Games would go on to publish King of Meat, which launched in October 2025. Last August GamesIndustry.biz spoke to Amazon's EMEA publishing director Jon Rosenblatt about its games strategy, and how King of Meat fit within its plans. "It's really important for us to continue to build amazing games, but also make sure that the games are diverse in their look and their feel," said Rosenblatt. "King of Meat was just an ideal opportunity for us to work with a very talented team in Guildford, and really grow that game out into something much bigger than maybe they have planned."

One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but the total number of those collecting benefits fell to the lowest level in eight months WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but the total number of those collecting benefits fell to the lowest level in eight months. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite recent high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark lending rate another quarter-point, its third straight cut to close out there year. The Fed has been slashing borrowing costs to prop up the slowing labor market. The Labor Department's report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: US jobless benefit applications jump to 236,000 last week as concerns about labor market persist

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remain in the same historically healthy range of the past few years despite growing concern over the health of the labor market. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000 new applications. The previous week’s figure, analysts say, was distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Despite what on the surface appears to be a historically healthy job market, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. While government data shows that the economy has added a sluggish 40,000 jobs a month since April, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. That would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of 20,000 jobs a month since the spring. “It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell told reporters. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.” Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite some high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years.

Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April, but some analysts said the plunge is due to a variety of factors, including seasonal adjustments and the fact that most people aren’t eligible for benefits after 26 weeks. The Labor Department’s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750.

Applicants line up at a job fair at the Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City N.J., on April 11, 2022. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remain in the same historically healthy range of the past few years despite growing concern over the health of the labor market. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000 new applications. The previous week’s figure, analysts say, was distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Despite what on the surface appears to be a historically healthy job market, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. While government data shows that the economy has added a sluggish 40,000 jobs a month since April, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. That would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of 20,000 jobs a month since the spring. “It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell told reporters. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.” Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite some high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April, but some analysts said the plunge is due to a variety of factors, including seasonal adjustments and the fact that most people aren’t eligible for benefits after 26 weeks. The Labor Department’s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Broadcom Shares Down 3% Thursday After Oracle's Earnings Disappoint

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast.

Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers.

XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast. In the Podcast, we break down the biggest news in AI each week and issue AI recommendations for our $500,000 AI Portfolio. One of our better recommendations: buying shares of Broadcom on October 11, 2024, and buying more on December 6, 2024. Those two recommendations are up 125% and 127%. Other great recommendations we’ve made include Credo (up 455%), Lumentum (339%), Ciena (243%), and SK Hynix (up 163%). We’ve embedded our latest episode below. Subscribing is absolutely free.

Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26.

Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Micron Stock Has Gained More Than 200% This Year. Why Experts See Additional Record Highs on the Horizon.

One of the hottest AI stocks appears to have more room to run. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) have surged to all-time highs this week as analysts continue to raise their targets for the memory chip maker ahead of next week's earnings report. Citi analysts on Wednesday lifted their price target to $300 from $275, now double where their target for the stock was in early September. The analysts said the increasing demand for the advanced memory chips used to run artificial intelligence models should help bring in "large capital infusions" that help Micron and other memory chip makers boost their manufacturing capabilities to meet demand. Micron shares rose more than 4% Wednesday to a record closing high of just below $264. The stock price has more than tripled since the start of the year. Micron supplies memory components to other manufacturers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), making Micron one of many beneficiaries of the AI trade. Micron is the top performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 this year, and only four stocks in the S&P 500 have posted bigger gains in 2025. Artificial intelligence companies are looking to buy the chips as fast as they can be made, leading to a shortage of memory chips that Citi analysts say is causing "unprecedented increases" in pricing, which should further boost Micron's sales and profits. Deutsche Bank analysts on Tuesday hiked their own price target to $280 from $200, calling Micron "well poised to benefit" from changes in the memory-chip market. The analysts also called Micron "particularly attractive among the memory names given its unique ability to prioritize profitability over market share in this environment." Morgan Stanley analysts raised their own price target for Micron last month to $325 from $220 after upgrading the stock in October, calling the memory chip maker a "top pick" because of how that dramatic increase in pricing for memory products could boost sales and profits in the next year, even if prices start to normalize. Analysts are largely bullish on Micron stock, but its average price target suggest that some analysts think the chip maker's stock has hit its ceiling, or are waiting until after next week's report to adjust their view. The 11 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha are split between nine "buy" and two "hold" ratings, with the average price target among those analysts at around $237.

Title: Why retro, innovative indies and Nintendo ruled game design in 2025

But the spectre of AI is looming for 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. For the world of video games, 2025 was more about what didn’t happen than what did. It was supposed to be the year in which the blockbuster of all blockbusters, Grand Theft Auto VI, arrived to sweep all before it, but GTA VI has now been definitively (so Rockstar Games assures us) delayed until 19th November, 2026. In light of that, 2025 will go down as a decent if unspectacular year for video game design – but some interesting trends and talking points emerged over the last twelve months, many of which may get overlooked at tonight's The Game Awards. Indie game developers and AA releases found favour ahead of costly blockbusters, retro gaming and the nostalgia hit of remakes won over new and old fans alike, VR threatened to go big, then didn't, and AI seeped into every aspect of game development, and it's not leaving. So-called AA games – with significantly smaller budgets than the AAAs churned out by the big publishers – conspicuously received the majority of the plaudits from those with an interest in games design in 2025. Especially Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, from French developer Sandfall Games and publisher Kepler Interactive, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, made by tiny Australian indie Team Cherry. Honourable mentions are also due for Rebellion’s Atomfall and Supergiant Games’ Hades II. All those games boasted strong, distinctive art direction and the sort of personality and quirkiness that the big publishers seemed unable to deliver. Next year will mark ten years since the current wave of VR was first hyped as the next big thing in game design, not to mention the future of our everyday lives. But just as the much-touted metaverse has failed to take off, that vaunted, hardware-shifting killer VR game has also stubbornly failed to appear. We had some good VR games in 2025, such as Alien: Rogue Incursion, that brought the industrial-futurism of the films to life, while Midnight Walk's hand-made claymation style felt original and demanded attention. So, while there are some fun and innovative VR games out there, there’s also a sense that unless VR headsets become drastically less uncomfortable and restrictive, and more affordable, VR will never achieve the mainstream heights once ascribed to it. And after a decade, is its crunch time approaching? Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. The games industry’s biggest money-makers are its annual franchises, churned out regularly by the mega-publishers. But are they finally starting to show signs of flagging? EA Sports’ FC 26 arrived with something of a mea culpa – a raft of changes touted as a response to fan criticism of FC 25. Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will probably snatch the coveted Christmas number one sales spot, but received a lukewarm welcome, with its (admittedly praised) Warzone element under pressure from an unheralded newcomer, ARC Raiders. And it was a disastrous year for perennial so-called live service games, with Sony cancelling Concord mere weeks after a disastrous launch, along with seven other live-service games purportedly under development. In both video games and the wider world, 2025 was indisputably the year of AI. And in the games world, familiar fears of AI replacing the likes of voice-artists, character artists and dialogue writers were voiced – perhaps fallaciously, since videogames have embraced AI since the mid-1990s. AI has already been used to ease and speed up game development, via techniques like procedural generation, and generative AI was used by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and ARC Raiders. But gamers are vigilantly looking out for so-called AI slop – which some less-scrutinised mobile games have been criticised for – and will cry foul if that creeps into console and PC games. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 couldn't escape accusations of AI use, while on the flipside, Ubisoft revealed its new game, Teammates, is built around the use of gen AI. Likewise, EA and Krafton have invested heavily in gen AI workflows. AI in video games doesn't look like stalling, but it leaves room for non-AI, human-made games to succeed in a heavily vigilant market. 2025 was a great year for remakes and remasters of old games – classics like the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games, Resident Evils 2 and 4, Broken Sword, the Dragon Quest games and The Elder Scrolls Oblivion received the modern-tech remake treatment, and the final instalment of Square Enix’s brilliant reimagining of Final Fantasy VII will arrive in 2026. Even Clair Obscur had retro-style turn-based gameplay, and solo-developer games (inevitably with retro-adjacent graphics) like Citizen Sleeper 2 and Quantum Witch created a stir. Redesigned hardware from Evercade and the brilliant Sinclair GamerCard helped make retro gaming more accessible, and the year is ending how it began, with the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate proving one of 2025's most hyped games. In 2025, gamers felt the most creative games came from indie, rather than major publishers. All the AA-games covered above were published by indies, and the likes of horror games Look Outside and No, I’m Not A Human, plus Ball x Pit and Blue Prince, were showered with praise for innovating. The list really is a good one for 2025: Skate Story, The Drifter, Rematch, Lushfoil Photography Sim, as well as the upcoming Will: Follow the Light. The best games from majors – Avowed, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Battlefield 6, Split Fiction, Death Stranding 2, Borderlands 4 and Assassin’s Creed Shadows – overwhelmingly had a whiff of “seen it all before” to them. And when Electronic Arts became the subject of a leveraged private equity buyout, it had to counter accusations that it would lose interest in its non-annual franchises like Mass Effect. The successful arrival of the Switch 2 demonstrated that Nintendo, while a major pillar of the games industry, still operates in its own unique way. The Switch 2 remains pricey and conceptually near-identical to its predecessor. However, I suspect that next year will see it really come into its own, when first-party titles are added to supplement Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and the recently released Metroid Prime 4, and crucially, it finally allows Nintendo-heads to play cross-platform blockbusters that were previously the sole province of Sony or Microsoft consoles. The rash of games industry layoffs that started in 2022 tailed off somewhat in 2025 but, to the dismay of all, by no means ended. Studios owned by the likes of Ubisoft, Amazon Games, 2K Games, Funcom and Square Enix were either shuttered or had their workforces slashed, albeit with most layoffs occurring in the US. Over-capacity after the world took to gaming during the Covid lockdown and overestimation of the appeal of live-service games caused that particular trend, but the industry hopes it’s finally approaching its endgame.

Title: Tiger teeth, dried seahorses and shark fins sold illegally on Facebook, BBC finds
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce91072g59no
Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:01:53Z
Full Content:
Endangered species, including tiger body parts, shark fins and pangolin scales, are being offered for sale on Facebook, BBC News has found. One Chinese user posted videos of a tiger in a cage that was for sale as well as pictures of tiger bones and teeth, while another included two live tiger cubs in a box. An image showed a tiger head and bones for sale piled up on scales. A seller told the BBC his products "can be shipped to the UK". He said a 10cm-long tooth would cost 2,000 Chines yuan (about £213) and that he could sell me tiger bones for 3,600 yuan per kilo (about £380). Another seller, who was offering shark fins, claimed to ship from the US to the UK and charged $50 per kilo (about £37). The sale of endangered species such as tigers and pangolin is illegal in the UK and CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, closely regulates international trade in species under threat. The voluntary agreement, signed by more than 180 countries and other bodies, only allows the trade if it is both legal and sustainable. It comes as Interpol has announced the results of a global crackdown on the wildlife trade, which it says led to the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals. Meta, which owns Facebook, says it does not allow the sale of endangered species and removes such content. The UK has strict laws on what species can be imported legally. However, BBC News also found British companies selling dried seahorses, which can only be traded in the UK if the seller can certify they were sustainably harvested. In practice, that's not possible and supplying them is likely to break the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, punishable by a fine or prison sentence. One seller was found promoting them as a tonic for mothers who have just given birth and as a medicine for combating coughs. There is no scientific evidence to support this. When contacted, the seller - based in the north of England - immediately sent pictures of the seahorses they had in stock. Ordering online cost just over £60. Two days after placing the order three packets containing 15 dead, dried seahorses arrived in the post. The delivery had no documentation about the origin of the specimens but did include a recipe on how to make soup with them. The BBC showed the samples to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, who said it "made him sick to his stomach". He said they could only have been supplied illegally. Three pregnant males were among the order - male seahorses carry as many as 200 young. Mr Garrick-Maidment says that, kilo for kilo, seahorses are currently worth as much as silver and warned further price rises could mean they are fished to extinction. The global trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth £17bn per year and Interpol assesses it to be the fourth largest international crime type behind drugs smuggling, people smuggling and arms trafficking. The pangolin, which is the only mammal completely covered in scales, has become the most trafficked animal on earth and is now critically endangered. A seller in Laos was found to be offering pangolin scales for sale on Facebook. He told the BBC he charged $150 per kilo. One user even offered to sell rhino horn and suggested making contact via private message. In a statement, Meta said: "We do not allow the sale of endangered species on our platforms." The social media platform says it takes down that kind of material as soon as it becomes aware of it, saying it encourages users to "report any content they think may violate our policies". Today Interpol announced the result of Operation Thunder, a month-long global initiative to combat the trade in endangered species. Authorities in 134 countries were involved in the operation which included the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals and 30 tonnes of animal parts. Interpol says the growth in live animal seizures is driven by the exotic pet trade, but the market in bushmeat is also on the rise. Kenyan authorities seized 400kg of giraffe meat as part of the global crackdown and, in Belgium, primate flesh was found. More than 4,000 shark fins were also intercepted. Danny Hewitt, Border Force's director for UK command operations who oversaw the British arm of Op Thunder, said there had been a 73% increase in seizures compared to 2023. That included live snakes, tarantulas and lovebirds found hidden in vehicles stopped at the UK border. As populations move to the UK they drive demand, he added. The trade has been driven by organised crime, and in many cases, customers who don't understand the harm they are doing. Mr Hewitt added: "They may not have been illegal in other parts of the world, but they are illegal in the UK." A historical site dating back to the last Saxon king is being revitalised. Seal pups and jellyfish-like organisms are among the creatures washed up on Dorset's beaches. California's governor Gavin Newsom issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order. The BBC asked people in Toronto and DC if they think an Australian-style, under-16 social media ban would work in Canada and the US. The new sonar technology hopes to help protect the fish on the River Dee from predators. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Title: Shares of Oracle slide 10% on revenue miss and rising capital expenditures
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/10/shares-oracle-slide-10-revenue-miss-rising-capital-expenditures/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T23:50:32Z

UPDATED 18:50 EST / DECEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Oracle Corp. dropped more than 10% in extended trading today after the cloud and database giant missed expectations on quarterly revenue while going full-steam ahead on its ongoing artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout. The company reported second-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.26 per share, easily beating Wall Street’s target of $1.64 per share. However, though revenue grew by 16% from a year earlier, to $16.06 billion, it fell short of the $16.21 billion analyst estimate. In terms of profitability, Oracle showed a big improvement, with net income of $6.14 billion in the quarter, up from just $3.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. However, the company’s guidance was perhaps a tad discouraging for investors. Oracle executives said they’re looking for earnings of between $1.70 and $1.74 in the third-quarter, which is only in-line with the Street’s forecast of $1.72. The company also called for revenue growth of between 19% and 21% versus the Street’s $16.87 billion estimate, which implies 19% growth. Oracle said it delivered $7.98 billion in cloud revenue during the quarter, above the $7.92 billion consensus estimate. Within that segment, cloud infrastructure revenue came to $4.1 billion, up 68% from a year ago. Today was the first quarterly earnings call by Oracle’s new co-Chief Executive Officers Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia, who took over the job from former CEO Safra Catz in September. In a call with analysts, Sicilia highlighted a number of new cloud infrastructure customer wins with companies including Airbus, Deutsche Bank, LSEG, Panasonic, Canon and Rubrik. Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann told SiliconANGLE that it’s quite telling that Sicilia felt the need to highlight so many customer wins during the call. “The market has been really nervous about Oracle’s overreliance on OpenAI and other AI plays from a RPO and forecast perspective, so this litany of customer wins and apps growth acceleration shows some welcome diversity,” she said. Oracle’s software business didn’t fare so well, however, with revenue declining 3%, to $5.88 billion, falling short of the Street’s $6.06 billion estimate. On the other hand, Oracle’s future does look promising, with the company pointing to remaining performance obligations that soared 438% from a year ago, to a staggering $523 billion. RPO, as the metric is known, refers to contracted revenue that has not yet been realized, and is really a measure of the company’s enormous backlog of orders, mostly for cloud infrastructure capacity. Wall Street had been forecasting RPO of $501.8 billion. Oracle Principle Financial Officer Doug Kehring said on the call that the increase was the result of new commitments by customers including Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp. and others, and told analysts that the company is hoping to be able to convert this revenue sooner than expected. “This is good news for Oracle and its capex story,” Wettemann said, referring to Oracle’s runaway capital expenditures. The company has been trying to position itself at the center of the AI boom by committing to a massive data center buildout, and expects capex to increase to $50 billion this year, up from $21.2 billion in the previous fiscal year. While the increased capex has boosted the company’s revenue and backlog, some investors have become worried about the enormous amounts of debt it has taken on to fund its investments. Much of Oracle’s backlog stems from OpenAI Group PBC, which has committed to spending more than $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure services over the next five years. “The longer the backlog sits there, the greater the risk that Oracle can’t monetize it, or the AI landscape changes enough that certain customers can’t pay on their commitments,” Wettemann explained. Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller said some eagle-eyed investors may have noted that Oracle’s growing revenue is coming at a steep cost, resulting in lower profitability as it generates more sales. “The problem is that the $2 billion in cloud revenue growth only translated to around half a billion in operating income,” the analyst said. “At the same time, Oracle keeps spending like a drunken sailor on capex and is cash flow-negative by $13 billion. While this could end up great if AI pans out, it could also become a problem.” Kehring tried to reassure investors, telling analysts on the call that the company remains committed to maintaining its investment-grade debt rating. “There are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,” he said. “Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.” Mueller agreed that the debt Oracle has been taking on isn’t a problem. “With interest payments at approximately $1 billion, the debt load is more than manageable for the company,” he said. The company said its earnings during the quarter were boosted by a $2.7 billion pretax gain on the sale of its interest in chip design business Ampere, which is set to be acquired by SoftBank Group Corp. for $6.5 billion. Oracle announced the sale in March. Oracle founder, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison (pictured), who remains the company’s most influential executive, said the decision to sell Ampere was taken because he thinks it no longer makes sense to continue designing, manufacturing and using its own chips in its data centers. “The company is committed to a policy of chip neutrality,” he said. “[It needs] to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy.” The earnings call comes on the back of a 23% drop in Oracle’s share price last month, its worst monthly performance since 2021. But although the stock declined further today, it’s still up more than 33% in the year to date, ahead of the broader, technology-focused Nasdaq index, which has gained just 22% this year.

Business Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan makes a speech on stage in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. REUTERS/Ann Wang SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 : When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan. Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters. Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company. Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion. Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Loading Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.”The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.VENTURE CAPITALIST AS CEOIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said.In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan.Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview.Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said.Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.”Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders.Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.”Tan does not perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said.In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.”The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date.U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock.DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGYTan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said.The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said.SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said.Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks.Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was "highly CONFLICTED.”According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal.Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITALSoon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change.Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said.One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows.ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.”Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show.Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows.Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million.Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies.One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading.TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova.Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.”The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information.Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure.The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said.The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUPIn 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper.SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which is designed for more specific AI applications.In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said.Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.”Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said. Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense. Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.” The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment. VENTURE CAPITALIST AS CEO Intel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank. Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said. Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said. In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan. Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview. Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said. Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.” Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders. Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.” Tan does not perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said. In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.” The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date. U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock. DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGY Tan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.” Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said. The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said. SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said. Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks. Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was "highly CONFLICTED.” According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal. Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITAL Soon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change. Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said. One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows. ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.” Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show. Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows. Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million. Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies. One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading. TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova. Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.” The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information. Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure. The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said. The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUP In 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board.

Title: Algorithms and Capitalism: Cleaning Up The Waze Parade

John Battelle's Search Blog Thoughts on the intersection of tech, business, and society. Do you feel it? A simmering discontent with the state of capitalism in American life? I certainly do. My kids engage with social media only if they have to – never because they wish to. They believe their feeds are manipulated by corporate interests, and they are distrustful of anyone who believes otherwise. My wife is convinced that anything she buys online – particularly the bigger ticket items like flights or hotels – is priced based on what algorithms calculate she can afford to pay – not what might be fair or offered to others. Parents in my friend group are terrified that their kids are using ChatGPT as a confidante and therapist whose motivations are unfathomable. The stock market keeps pushing ever upwards, but my colleagues are increasingly convinced a crash is around the corner. Something just feels….off. The complex socio-economic system that we’re all a part of seems rigged. And we feel powerless to do anything about it. Two news items from the past few days underscore this gloomy sensibility. From the Times comes this gem: Same Product, Same Store, but on Instacart, Prices Might Differ. Here’s the takeaway: digital aggregators like Instacart (and Uber, and Expedia, etc.) use a sophisticated combination of data, algorithms, and AI to extract as much profit as they can from each and every consumer with which they interact. It’s called dynamic pricing, and it’s an inevitable consequence of capitalism colliding with the digital economy. Turns out, my wife was right. The second item offering proof that something’s rotten in the state of capitalism comes courtesy of 404 Media, which uncovered some downright insidious behavior from Meta’s Instagram (I know, shocking!). In short, Instagram is creating AI-generated content based on its own users’ posts, then injecting that content into Google so as to drive more traffic back to Instagram. It’s a perfect example of “growth hacking,” a practice that Meta/Facebook perfected more than ten years ago. Turns out, my kids were right to not trust their social media feeds. What connects these two stories is how the “customer” is treated by tech platforms. The Instagram user whose posts are being distorted in pursuit of traffic, the Instacart consumer who sees a price driven by extractive algorithms – they’re being manipulated by forces they can’t see or understand. In short, they’re being treated like commodified inputs to a system, not valued customers who might have a choice as to where they shop or spend their time. They’re being taken for granted. Have you ever found yourself part of a “Waze parade,” blindly following the algorithm’s increasingly complicated instructions through suburban streets just to save a few seconds of time on your way to your destination? It kind of feels like that’s happening everywhere now, across every digital surface that’s intermediated by a profit-seeking technology company. We know it sucks, but hell, we’re already way off the highway and deep in unfamiliar territory, so let’s just keep making those lefts and rights, and hope we get there, right? Is there a way out of this algorithmic prison? I’m not sure, but I sense personal AI agents – ones that work only for us – could be a big part of the solution. I’ve written recently about the problems facing personal agents, and heard back from someone who’s working on those problems via a “loyal agents” consortium led by Consumer Reports, amongst others. They call their work “conscious commerce” – and I’m cheering for their success. From a recent post: If agentic commerce is built the way the internet works today, we’ll get an economy even more by advertising and other perverse incentives—one where your buying decisions are based on obscure deals between online retailers and AI companies, where all the intimate conversations you share flow into an ad platform, and where manipulative AI chatbots whisper in your ear over the months to spend more, or more foolishly. It doesn’t have to be that way. If we’re intentional, we can use this moment to build something much more consumer-centric—an economy where consumers have more power than ever before.

Don’t you love the way they gaslight us by making it sound like it’s something that we all might benefit from?

Title: Will Meta Platforms (META) Stock Hit $1,000 in 2027?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Derick Hudson / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Guided by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a business seeking a direction. Is Meta Platforms a social media giant, a metaverse pioneer, or an artificial intelligence (AI) technology trailblazer? Some investors have expressed disappointment about the performance of Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs metaverse/virtual reality (VR) business unit. On the other hand, Meta Platforms has more than 4 billion eyeballs on its social media applications globally. Thus, Meta Platforms is a force to be reckoned with and META stock could be poised for significant upside. In an optimistic scenario, the Meta Platforms share price could even reach $1,000 by the end of 2027 — but don’t place any bets until you’ve reviewed the catalysts and concerns. Since 2025 is nearly over, we can assess the year’s performance of Meta Platforms stock. The shares are up 11% year to date and are only up 5% over the past 12 months. That’s a decent performance, but it’s nothing to write home about. Frankly, META stock hasn’t been so magnificent lately even though Meta Platforms is a member of the Magnificent Seven. To hit $1,000 by the end of 2027, Meta Platforms stock would have to rise 54% from its current price of approximately $650. Even with a strong finish in December of this year, META stock would need to gain around 25% in 2026 and another 25% in 2027. At least, we can say that Meta Platforms stock looks reasonably valued after a decent but not spectacular 2025. At the moment, Meta Platforms has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.79x, which isn’t excessive for a mega-cap technology firm. While it doesn’t appear to be over-valued, Meta Platforms will still need to demonstrate robust financial growth for META stock to reach $1,000. So, let’s take a glance at the most recent quarterly data and analyze Meta Platforms’s growth trajectory. Here are the need-to-know data points. In the third quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ total revenue grew 26.2% year over year to $51.242 billion versus $40.589 billion in the year-earlier quarter. As usual, the majority of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.082 billion for Q3 2025) came from the company’s Advertising segment. Looking at it from another angle, nearly all of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.772 billion) was derived from the company’s “Family of Apps” (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.). Suffice it to say, then, that app-based advertisements continue to be Meta Platforms’ bread and butter. Turning to the company’s bottom-line results, Meta Platforms’ net income declined 82.7% from $15.688 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $2.709 billion in Q3 2025. This occurred despite Meta Platforms aforementioned revenue growth. There’s no need to panic about this, though, as Meta Platforms’ year-on-year net income decline may just be a one-time tax-accounting issue. As it turns out, the company’s “provision for income taxes” jumped from $2.134 billion in 2024’s third quarter to $18.954 billion in the third quarter of 2025. The critics may be willing to overlook Meta Platforms’ steep net income drop-off, but there’s another possible objection. In particular, they could complain that Meta Platforms relies heavily on social media app ad revenue. That may be the case, but Zuckerberg clearly wants to expand Meta Platforms into new, intriguing technology fields. Will the CEO’s bold vision be a boon for Meta Platforms, though? After multiple quarters of operating losses from Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs division, investors may be relieved to see Zuckerberg shifting his attention to AI instead of the metaverse. Lately, there’s been talk about Meta Platforms possibly gearing up to introduce next-generation AI glasses next year. However, Meta Platforms will need to effectively parlay its legions of app users into a loyal base of AI tech consumers. Until that happens, Meta Platforms’ foray into AI technology will be quite costly. From 2024’s third quarter to Q3 2025, Meta Platforms’ research and development expenses ramped up 35.5%, from $11.177 billion to $15.144 billion. Plus, there are no signs that Meta Platforms’ spending spree will end anytime soon. Just this year, Meta Platforms expects to have spent a mind-blowing $72 billion on AI technology. Over the next three years, the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure and job investments, presumably to include AI tech development. It’s a costly pivot, and there’s no assurance that Meta Platforms will convert its millions of eyeballs into enthusiastic AI glasses wearers. Remember, Meta Platforms tried to get consumers to wear VR headsets but that didn’t work out as planned. Meta Platforms can rely on its massive app advertising revenue for growth, but the next chapter in the company’s story hasn’t been written yet. Zuckerberg’s AI obsession may turn out to be a costly misstep, just as Reality Labs ended up. Hence, it’s possible but unlikely that META stock will gain 25% in 2026 and then gain another 25% in 2027. Getting Meta Platforms shares to $1,000 is a tall order that would require strong evidence that the company’s spending spree is justified. So far, the proof just isn’t there yet, so investors should stay cautious for now. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

The last time so much wealth was tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET on December 12, 2025 A company that most people have never heard of is among the year’s best-performing technology firms—and a symbol of the complex, interconnected, and potentially catastrophic ways in which AI companies do business these days. CoreWeave’s IPO in March was the largest of any tech start-up since 2021, and the company’s share price has subsequently more than doubled, outperforming even the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. On Wall Street, CoreWeave is regularly referred to as one of the most important companies powering the AI revolution. In the past few months, it has announced a $22 billion partnership with OpenAI, a $14 billion deal with Meta, and a $6 billion arrangement with Nvidia. Not bad for a former crypto-mining firm turned data-center operator with zero profits and billions of dollars in debt on its books. CoreWeave’s business model consists of buying up lots of high-end computer chips, and building or leasing data centers to house those chips. It then rents out those assets to AI companies that need computing power but prefer not to take on the huge up-front costs themselves. If this is straightforward enough, CoreWeave’s financial situation is anything but. The company expects to bring in $5 billion in revenue this year while spending roughly $20 billion. To cover that gap, the company has taken on $14 billion in debt, nearly a third of which comes due in the next year. Many of these loans were issued by private-equity firms at high interest rates, and several use complex forms of financial engineering, such as giving the money to newly formed legal entities created for the explicit purpose of borrowing on CoreWeave’s behalf (more on that later). CoreWeave also faces $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. From the May 2025 issue: The new king of tech The money that CoreWeave is making, meanwhile, comes from just a few intimately connected sources. A single customer, Microsoft, is responsible for as much as 70 percent of its revenue; its next biggest customers, Nvidia and OpenAI, might make up another 20 percent, though exact numbers are hard to find. Nvidia is also CoreWeave’s supplier of chips and one of its major investors, meaning CoreWeave is using Nvidia’s money to buy Nvidia’s chips and then renting them right back to Nvidia. OpenAI is also a major CoreWeave investor and has close financial partnerships with both Nvidia and Microsoft. All of this might make CoreWeave the purest distillation of a trend sweeping through the AI sector. In recent months, tech giants including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle have been making gargantuan investments in new data centers, tying together their fortunes through circular financing deals, and borrowing huge piles of debt from lightly regulated lenders. The companies and their most ardent backers argue that these deals will set them up to capture the limitless profits of the coming AI revolution. But the last time the economy saw so much wealth tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. If the AI revolution fails to materialize on the scale or the timeline that the industry expects, the economic consequences could be very ugly indeed. The extreme financialization of the AI sector reflects a simple reality: The infrastructure required to train and run AI systems is so expensive that not even the largest companies have enough cash to pay for it all. Spending on data centers is conservatively projected to exceed $400 billion this year, roughly the size of the economy of Denmark; McKinsey estimates that it will reach nearly $7 trillion by 2030. Creative measures are necessary to pay for all of this investment. At the center of the action is Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company. Companies that train and run AI systems, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, need Nvidia’s chips but don’t have the cash on hand to pay for them. Nvidia, meanwhile, has plenty of cash but needs customers to keep buying its chips. So the parties have made a series of deals in which the AI companies are effectively paying Nvidia by handing over a share of their future profits in the form of equity. The chipmaker has struck more than 50 deals this year, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI and (with Microsoft) a $15 billion investment in Anthropic. Formally, these transactions don’t obligate the AI companies to spend money on Nvidia’s chips—an Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “does not require any of the companies we invest in to use Nvidia technology”—but in practice, that’s where the money goes. OpenAI has made its own series of deals, including agreements to purchase $300 billion of computing power from Oracle, $38 billion from Amazon, and $22 billion from CoreWeave. Those cloud providers, in turn, are an important market for Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI has also invested in several smaller AI start-ups, which in exchange have agreed to pay for ChatGPT enterprise accounts. Even when represented visually, the resulting web of interlocking relationships is almost impossible to track. Together, these arrangements amount to an entire industry making a double-or-nothing bet on a product that is nowhere near profitable. A single company, OpenAI, is simultaneously a major source of revenue and investment for several cloud companies and chipmakers; a close financial partner to Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon; a significant customer for Nvidia; and a leading investor in AI start-ups. And yet the company is projected to generate only $10 billion this year in revenue—less than a fifth of what it needs annually just to fund its deal with Oracle. It is on track to lose at least $15 billion this year, and doesn’t expect to be profitable until at least 2029. By one estimate, AI companies collectively will generate $60 billion in revenue against $400 billion in spending this year. The one company that is making a lot of money from the AI boom, Nvidia, is doing so only because everyone else is buying its chips in the hopes of obtaining future profits. The AI companies and their boosters see this as a gamble worth taking. Demand for AI services, they point out, is growing at an exponential rate. According to calculations by Azeem Azhar, a widely cited AI-industry analyst, the direct revenues from AI services have increased nearly ninefold over the past two years. If that pace continues, then it’s only a matter of time before AI companies will begin making record-shattering profits. “I think people who fixate on exactly how these investments are being financed are stuck in an outdated way of thinking,” Azhar told me. “Everyone is assuming that this technology will improve at a linear pace. But AI is an exponential technology. It’s a whole different paradigm.” If, however, AI does not produce the short-term profits its proponents envision—if its technical advances slow down and its productivity-enhancing effects underwhelm, as a mounting body of evidence suggests may be the case—then the financial ties that bind the sector together could become everyone’s collective downfall. The extreme concentration of stock-market wealth in a handful of tech companies with deep financial links to one another could make an AI crash even more severe than the dot-com crash of the 2000s. And a stock-market correction might be the least of America’s worries. When equity investments go bad, investors might lose their shirts, but the damage to the real economy is typically contained. (The dot-com crash, for example, didn’t cause mass unemployment.) But the AI build-out is so expensive that it can’t be funded by equity investments alone. To finance their investments, AI companies have taken on hundreds of billions of dollars in debt, a number that Morgan Stanley expects to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2028. When a bunch of highly leveraged loans go bad at the same time, the fallout can spread throughout the financial system and trigger a major recession. The AI sector’s debt is, of course, not guaranteed to go bad. But the complex way in which it is arranged and packaged isn’t reassuring. For instance, earlier this year, Meta decided to build a new data center in Louisiana that will cost $27 billion. Instead of applying for a loan from a traditional lender, the company partnered with Blue Owl Capital, a private-equity firm, to set up a separate legal entity, known as a special-purpose vehicle, or SPV, that will borrow the money on Meta’s behalf, build the data center according to Meta’s instructions, and then lease it back to Meta. Because Blue Owl is technically the majority owner of the project, this setup keeps the debt off of Meta’s balance sheet, enabling the company to keep borrowing at low interest rates without worrying about a hit to its credit rating. Other companies, including xAI, CoreWeave, and Google, have borrowed or plan to borrow huge sums through similar kinds of arrangements. Meta has described its arrangement with Blue Owl as an “innovative partnership” that is “designed to support the speed and flexibility required for Meta’s data center projects.” But the reason the credit-rating system exists is to give lenders and investors a clear sense of the risk they are taking on when they issue a loan. A long history exists of companies trying to circumvent that system. In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, several major financial institutions used SPVs to keep billions of dollars in household debt off of their balance sheets. Enron, the energy corporation that famously collapsed in 2001 after a massive accounting scandal, used SPVs to mask its shady accounting practices. “When I see arrangements like this, it’s a huge red flag,” Paul Kedrosky, a managing partner at SK Ventures and research fellow at MIT who has written extensively about financial-engineering techniques, told me. “It sends the signal that these companies really don’t want the credit-rating agencies to look too closely at their spending.” SPVs aren’t the only 2008-era financing tool making a comeback. Data-center debt totaling billions of dollars is being sliced up into “asset-backed securities,” which are then bundled and sold to investors. This is not an inherently problematic way for companies to fund their borrowing. But Kedrosky argues that during periods of heightened speculation, these vehicles turn debt into a financial product whose worth is disconnected from the value of the underlying asset it represents—which can encourage reckless behavior. “Investors see these complex financial products and they say, I don’t care what’s happening inside—I just care that it’s highly rated and promises a big return,” Kedrosky said. “That’s what happened in ’08. And once that kind of thinking takes off, it becomes really dangerous.” Rogé Karma: Just how bad would an AI bubble be? Then there are the so-called GPU-backed loans. Several data-center builders and cloud providers, including CoreWeave, have obtained multibillion-dollar loans to purchase chips by posting their existing chips as collateral, just as many homeowners used their homes as collateral to take out loans for second and third homes in the 2000s. But, as Advait Arun, an analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise, notes in a recent report on the AI sector’s finances, whether that collateral will hold its value is far from clear. When new chip models are released, the value of older models tends to fall. According to Arun, if the collapse in chip prices were steep enough, a vicious cycle could ensue. As older chips fall in value, any loan using those chips as collateral suddenly becomes at risk of default. Lenders might respond by calling in their loans early, before companies have the revenue to pay them back. At that point, the lender might try to sell the chips to recoup their investment, but that will only flood the market with even more chips, driving down the values of existing chips even further, causing other lenders to call in their loans and so on. “A few months ago I would have told you that this was building toward a repeat of the dot-com crash,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. “But all of this debt and financial engineering is making me increasingly worried about a 2008-like scenario.” The federal government responded to the 2008 crisis by limiting the ability of traditional banks to take on big, risky loans. Since then, however, private-equity firms, which aren’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as banks, have gotten more heavily into the lending business. As of early this year, these firms had lent about $450 billion in so-called private credit to the tech sector, including financing several of the deals discussed above. And, according to one estimate, they will lend it another $800 billion over the next two years. “If the AI bubble goes bust, they are the ones that will be left holding the bag,” Arun told me. A private-credit bust is almost certainly preferable to a banking bust. Unlike banks, private-equity firms don’t have ordinary depositors. In theory, if their loans fail, the groups that will be hurt the most are institutional investors, such as pension funds, university endowments, and hedge funds, limiting the damage to the broader economy. The problem is that nobody knows for certain that this is the case. Private credit is functionally a black box. Unlike banks, these entities don’t have to disclose who they are getting their money from, how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. This makes it impossible for regulators to know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy. Evidence is growing that the links between private credit and the rest of the financial system are stronger than once believed. Careful studies from the Federal Reserve estimate that up to a quarter of bank loans to nonbank financial institutions are now made to private-credit firms (up from just 1 percent in 2013) and that major life-insurance companies have nearly $1 trillion tied up in private credit. These connections raise the prospect that a big AI crash could lead to a wave of private-credit failures, which could in turn bring down major banks and insurers, Natasha Sarin, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in financial regulation, told me. “Unfortunately, it usually isn’t until after a crisis that we realize just how interconnected the different parts of the financial system were all along,” she said. An AI-induced financial disaster is far from inevitable. Still, given the warning signs, one would hope for the federal government to be doing what it can to reduce the risk of a crisis. Instead, the Trump administration is doing the opposite. In August, the president signed an executive order that instructs federal agencies to loosen regulations so that ordinary 401(k) holders can invest directly in “alternative assets” such as, yes, private credit, a change that could expose a far broader swath of the public to the fallout if AI loans go bad. Perhaps that is the key difference between 2008 and 2025. Back then, the federal government was caught off guard by the crash; this time, it appears to be courting one.

Title: King of Meat studio was reportedly expecting 100,000 concurrent players, but it peaked at 320 on Steam—and that was during a free weekend

Glowmade is now reportedly making layoffs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. An Insider Gaming report says Glowmade Games will lay off employees in January 2026 after its debut game, the Amazon-published King of Meat, flopped badly. While the number of employees being put out of work isn't known, sources told the site that the process began earlier this month with discussions about voluntary redundancies that would impact about a dozen people. Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn, comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a "co-op party platformer" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims "leadership"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches. That doesn't tell the full story, since King of Meat is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. But even if each of those platforms had 100 times as many players as Steam, which seems extremely unlikely, King of Meat would still only be 1/50th (figures approximate, I am bad at math) of the way toward the minimum number of players anticipated by management. That's not just a big flop, it also speaks very poorly of the judgment of the high-ups who thought this game would be a hit on that scale. We can't say for certain whether that reported figure is accurate, but we can say that a lot of money and effort was poured into marketing King of Meat, including an announcement trailer at the Geoff Keighley-hosted Opening Night Live show at Gamescom 2024—that couldn't have been cheap—and an entire Mr. Beast special, complete with $250,000 prize. Optimism is great—you won't get far in the videogame business without it—but the expectations placed on King of Meat were wildly out of place. And that's not just hindsight speaking: Turn the page back to that ONL reveal in August 2024, when PC Gamer senior editor Wes Fenlon said King of Meat "seems doomed to be a casualty of the live service era before it's even out." What comes next for King of Meat isn't clear, but probably nothing good. Amazon made major cuts to its gaming business as part of a massive wave of layoffs in October, which also saw it pull the plug on New World, a not-terribly-old MMO that was still attracting a decent audience. If New World can't make it on Amazon's watch, I don't imagine King of Meat has much hope for a bright future either.

Title: Is It a Bubble? By Howard Marks
URL: https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/is-it-a-bubble
Time Published: 2025-12-10T17:30:43Z
Full Content:
Ours is a remarkable moment in world history. A transformative technology is ascending, and its supporters claim it will forever change the world. To build it requires companies to invest a sum of money unlike anything in living memory. News reports are filled with widespread fears that America’s biggest corporations are propping up a bubble that will soon pop. During my visits to clients in Asia and the Middle East last month, I was often asked about the possibility of a bubble surrounding artificial intelligence, and my discussions gave rise to this memo. I want to start off with my usual caveats: I’m not active in the stock market; I merely watch it as the best barometer of investor psychology. I’m also no techie, and I don’t know any more about AI than most generalist investors. But I’ll do my best. One of the most interesting aspects of bubbles is their regularity, not in terms of timing, but rather the progression they follow. Something new and seemingly revolutionary appears and worms its way into people’s minds. It captures their imagination, and the excitement is overwhelming. The early participants enjoy huge gains. Those who merely look on feel incredible envy and regret and – motivated by the fear of continuing to miss out – pile in. They do this without knowledge of what the future will bring or concern about whether the price they’re paying can possibly be expected to produce a reasonable return with a tolerable amount of risk. The end result for investors is inevitably painful in the short to medium term, although it’s possible to end up ahead after enough years have passed. I’ve lived through several bubbles and read about others, and they’ve all hewed to this description. One might think the losses experienced when past bubbles popped would discourage the next one from forming. But that hasn’t happened yet, and I’m sure it never will. Memories are short, and prudence and natural risk aversion are no match for the dream of getting rich on the back of a revolutionary technology that “everyone knows” will change the world. I took the quote that opens this memo from Derek Thompson’s November 4 newsletter entitled “AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself,” about parallels between what’s going on today in AI and the railroad boom of the 1860s. Its word-for-word applicability to both shows clearly what’s meant by the phrase widely attributed to Mark Twain: “history rhymes.” Understanding Bubbles Before diving into the subject at hand – and having read a great deal about it in preparation – I want to start with a point of clarification. Everyone asks, “Is there a bubble in AI?” I think there’s ambiguity even in the question. I’ve concluded there are two different but interrelated bubble possibilities to think about: one in the behavior of companies within the industry, and the other in how investors are behaving with regard to the industry. I have absolutely no ability to judge whether the AI companies’ aggressive behavior is justified, so I’ll try to stick primarily to the question of whether there’s a bubble around AI in the financial world. The main job of an investment analyst – especially in the so-called “value” school to which I subscribe – is to (a) study companies and other assets and assess the level of and outlook for their intrinsic value and (b) make investment decisions on the basis of that value. Most of the change the analyst encounters in the short to medium term surrounds the asset’s price and its relationship to underlying value. That relationship, in turn, is essentially the result of investor psychology. Market bubbles aren’t caused directly by technological or financial developments. Rather, they result from the application of excessive optimism to those developments. As I wrote in my January memo On Bubble Watch, bubbles are temporary manias in which developments in those areas become the subject of what former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called “irrational exuberance.’’ Bubbles usually coalesce around new financial developments (e.g., the South Sea Company of the early 1700s or sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities in 2005-06) or technological progress (optical fiber in the late 1990s and the internet in 1998-2000). Newness plays a huge part in this. Because there’s no history to restrain the imagination, the future can appear limitless for the new thing. And futures that are perceived to be limitless can justify valuations that go well beyond past norms – leading to asset prices that aren’t justified on the basis of predictable earning power. The role of newness is well described in my favorite passage from a book that greatly influenced me, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith wrote about what he called “the extreme brevity of the financial memory” and pointed out that in the financial markets, “past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” In other words, history can impose limits on awe regarding the present and imagination regarding the future. In the absence of history, on the other hand, all things seem possible. The key thing to note here is that the new thing understandably inspires great enthusiasm, but bubbles are what happen when the enthusiasm reaches irrational proportions. Who can identify the boundary of rationality? Who can say when an optimistic market has become a bubble? It’s just a matter of judgment. Something that occurred to me this past month is that two of my best “calls” came in 2000, when I cautioned about what was going on in the market for tech and internet stocks, and in 2005-07, when I cited the dearth of risk aversion and the resulting ease of doing crazy deals in the pre-Global Financial Crisis world. First, in neither case did I possess any expertise regarding the things that turned out to be the subjects of the bubbles: the internet and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. All I did was render observations regarding the behavior taking place around me. And second, the value in my calls consisted mostly of describing the folly in that behavior, not in insisting that it had brought on a bubble. Struggling with whether to apply the “bubble” label can bog you down and interfere with proper judgment; we can accomplish a great deal by merely assessing what’s going on around us and drawing inferences with regard to proper behavior. What’s Good About Bubbles? Before going on to discuss AI and whether it’s presently in a bubble, I want to spend a little time on a subject that may seem somewhat academic from the standpoint of investors: the upside of bubbles. You may find the attention I devote to this topic excessive, but I do so because I find it fascinating. The November 5 Stratechery newsletter was entitled “The Benefits of Bubbles.” In it, Ben Thompson (no relation to Derek) cites a book titled Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation. It was written by Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, who propose that there are two kinds of bubbles: . . . “Inflection Bubbles” – the good kind of bubbles, as opposed to the much more damaging “Mean-reversion Bubbles” like the 2000’s subprime mortgage bubble. I find this a useful dichotomy. The financial fads I’ve read about or witnessed – the South Sea Company, portfolio insurance, and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities – stirred the imagination based on the promise of returns without risk, but there was no expectation that they would represent overall progress for mankind. There was, for example, no thought that housing would be revolutionized by the sub-prime mortgage movement, merely a feeling that there was money to be made from backing new buyers. Hobart and Huber call these “mean-reverting bubbles,” presumably because there’s no expectation that the underlying developments would move the world forward. Fads merely rise and fall. On the other hand, Hobart and Huber call bubbles based on technological progress – as in the case of the railroads and the internet – “inflection bubbles.” After an inflection-driven bubble, the world will not revert to its prior state. In such a bubble, “investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past and trade accordingly.” As Thompson tells us: The definitive book on bubbles has long been Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. Bubbles were – are – thought to be something negative and to be avoided, particularly at the time Perez published her book. The year was 2002 and much of the world was in a recession coming off the puncturing of the dot-com bubble. Perez didn’t deny the pain: in fact, she noted that similar crashes marked previous revolutions, including the Industrial Revolution, railways, electricity, and the automobile. In each case the bubbles were not regrettable, but necessary: the speculative mania enabled what Perez called the “Installation Phase,” where necessary but not necessarily financially wise investments laid the groundwork for the “Deployment Period.” What marked the shift to the deployment period was the popping of the bubble; what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments. (All emphasis added) This distinction is very meaningful for Hobart and Huber, and I agree. They say, “not all bubbles destroy wealth and value. Some can be understood as important catalysts for techno-scientific progress.” But I would restate as follows: “Mean-reversion bubbles” – in which markets soar on the basis of some new financial miracle and then collapse – destroy wealth. On the other hand, “inflection bubbles” based on revolutionary developments accelerate technological progress and create the foundation for a more prosperous future, and they destroy wealth. The key is to not be one of the investors whose wealth is destroyed in the process of bringing on progress. Hobart and Huber go on to describe in greater depth the process through which bubbles finance the building of the infrastructure required by the new technology and thus accelerate its adoption: Most novel technology doesn’t just appear ex nihilo [i.e., from nothing], entering the world fully formed and all at once. Rather, it builds on previous false starts, failures, iterations, and historical path dependencies. Bubbles create opportunities to deploy the capital necessary to fund and speed up such large-scale experimentation – which includes lots of trial and error done in parallel – thereby accelerating the rate of potentially disruptive technologies and breakthroughs. By generating positive feedback cycles of enthusiasm and investment, bubbles can be net beneficial. Optimism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Speculation provides the massive financing needed to fund highly risky and exploratory projects; what appears in the short term to be excessive enthusiasm or just bad investing turns out to be essential for bootstrapping social and technological innovations . . . A bubble can be a collective delusion, but it can also be an expression of collective vision. That vision becomes a site of coordination for people and capital and for the parallelization of innovation. Instead of happening over time, bursts of progress happen simultaneously across different domains. And with mounting enthusiasm . . . comes increased risk tolerance and strong network effects. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, attracts even more participants, entrepreneurs, and speculators, further reinforcing this positive feedback loop. Like bubbles, FOMO tends to have a bad reputation, but it’s sometimes a healthy instinct. After all, none of us wants to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build the future. In other words, bubbles based on technological progress are good because they excite investors into pouring in money – a good bit of which is thrown away – to carpet-bomb a new area of opportunity and thus jump-start its exploitation. The key realization seems to be that if people remained patient, prudent, analytical, and value-insistent, novel technologies would take many years and perhaps decades to be built out. Instead, the hysteria of the bubble causes the process to be compressed into a very short period – with some of the money going into life-changing investment in the winners but a lot of it being incinerated. A bubble has aspects that are both technological and financial, but the above citations are from the standpoint of people who crave technological progress and are perfectly happy to see investors lose money in its interest. “We,” on the other hand, would like to see technological progress but have no desire to throw away money to help bring it about. Ben Thompson ends this discussion by saying, “This is why I’m excited to talk about new technologies, the prospect for which I don’t know.” I love the fact that he’s excited by future possibilities and at the same time admits that the shape of the future is unknown (in our world, we might say “very risky”). Assessing the Current Landscape Now let’s get down to what we used to call “brass tacks.” What do we know? First, I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t believe artificial intelligence has the potential to be one of the biggest technological developments of all time, reshaping both daily life and the global economy. We also know that in recent years, economies and markets have become increasingly dependent on AI: AI is responsible for a very large portion of companies’ total capital expenditures. Capital expenditures on AI capacity account for a large share of the growth in U.S. GDP. AI stocks have been the source of the vast majority of the gains of the S&P 500. As a Fortune headline put it on October 7: 75% of gains, 80% of profits, 90% of capex – AI’s grip on the S&P is total and Morgan Stanley’s top analyst is ‘very concerned’ Further, I think it’s important to note that whereas the gains in AI-related stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of the total gains in all stocks, the excitement AI injects into the market must have added a lot to the appreciation of non-AI stocks as well. AI-related stocks have shown astronomical performance, led by Nvidia, the leading developer of computer chips for AI. From its formation in 1993 and its initial public offering in 1999, when its estimated market value was $626 million, Nvidia briefly became the world’s first company worth $5 trillion. That’s appreciation of around 8,000x, or roughly 40% a year for 26+ years. No wonder imaginations have been fired. What Are the Areas of Uncertainty? I think it’s fair to say that while we know AI will be a source of incredible change, most of us have no idea exactly what it will be able to do, how it will be applied commercially, or what the timing will be. Who will be the winners, and what will they be worth? If a new technology is assumed to be a world changer, it’s invariably assumed that the leading companies possessing that technology will be of great value. But how accurate will that assumption prove to be? As Warren Buffett pointed out in 1999, “[The automobile was] the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the 20th century. . . . If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the 2,000 companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. So autos had an enormous impact on America but the opposite direction on investors.” (Time, January 23, 2012) In AI, there are some very strong leaders at present, including some of the world’s strongest and richest companies. But new technology is notoriously disruptive. Will today’s leaders prevail or give way to upstarts? How much will the arms race cost, and who will win? Similarly, what’s a share in an upstart worth? Unlike front runners worth trillions, it’s possible to invest in some would-be challengers at enterprise values in mere billions or even – might I say? – millions. On June 25, 2024, CNBC reported as follows: A team founded by college dropouts has raised $120 million from investors led by Primary Venture Partners to build a new AI chip to take on Nvidia. Etched CEO Gavin Uberti said the startup is betting that as AI develops, most of the technology’s power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. “If transformers go away, we’ll die,” Uberti told CNBC. “But if they stick around, we’re the biggest company of all time.” Even granting the possibility that Etched won’t become the biggest company of all time, if success could give them a valuation just one-fifth of Nvidia’s peak – a mere $1 trillion – what probability of success would be required to justify an investment of $120 million? Assuming for simplicity’s sake that the investment was for a 100% ownership stake, all you need is a belief that achieving the trillion-dollar value has a probability of one-tenth of a percent for an expected return of over eight times your money. Who’s to say Etched doesn’t have that chance? And in that case, why would anyone not play? The foregoing is what I call “lottery-ticket thinking,” in which the dream of an enormous payoff justifies – no, compels – participation in an endeavor with an overwhelming probability of failing. There’s nothing wrong with calculating expected values this way. Leading venture capitalists engage in it every day to great effect. But assumptions regarding the possible payoffs and their probabilities must be reasonable. Thinking about a trillion-dollar payout will override reasonableness in any calculation. Will AI produce profits, and for whom? Two things we know little or nothing about are the profits AI will produce for vendors and its impact on non-AI companies, primarily meaning those who employ it. Will AI be a monopoly or duopoly, in which one or two leading companies are able to charge dearly for the capabilities? Or will it be a highly competitive free-for-all in which a number of firms compete on price for users’ spending on AI services, making it a commodity? Or, perhaps most likely, will it be a mix of leading companies and specialized players, some of whom compete on price and others through proprietary advantages. It’s said that the services currently responding to AI queries, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, lose money on every query they answer (of course, it’s not unusual for participants in a new industry to offer “loss leaders” for a while). Will the leading tech firms – used to success in winner-take-all markets – be content to experience losses in their AI businesses for years in order to gain share? Hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to the race for AI leadership. Who will win, and what will be the result? Likewise, what will be AI’s impact on the companies that use it? Clearly, AI will be a great tool for enhancing users’ productivity by, among other things, replacing workers with computer-sourced labor and intelligence. But will this ability to cut costs add to the profit margins of the companies that employ it? Or will it simply enable price wars among those companies in the pursuit of customers? In that case, the savings might be passed on to the customers rather than garnered by the companies. In other words, is it possible AI will increase the efficiency of businesses without increasing their profitability? Should we worry about so-called “circular deals”? In the telecom boom of the late 1990s, in which optical fiber became overbuilt, fiber-owning companies engaged in transactions with each other that permitted them to report profits. If two companies own fiber, they just have an asset on their books. But if each buys capacity from the other, they can both report profits . . . so they did. In other cases, manufacturers loaned network operators money to buy equipment from them, before the operators had customers to justify the buildout. All this resulted in profits that were illusory. Nowadays, deals are being announced in which money appears to be round-tripped between AI players. People who believe there’s an AI bubble find it easy to view these transactions with suspicion. Is the purpose to achieve legitimate business goals or to exaggerate progress? Adding to worries, critics say, some of the deals that OpenAI has made with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others are oddly circular. OpenAI is set to receive billions from tech companies but also sends billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. . . . Nvidia has also made some deals that have raised questions about whether the company is paying itself. It announced that it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips. . . . Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics also call circular deals. (The New York Times, November 20) Noteworthily, OpenAI has made investment commitments to industry counterparties totaling $1.4 trillion, even though it has yet to turn a profit. The company makes clear that the investments are to be paid out of revenues received from the same parties and that it has ways to back out of these commitments. But all this raises the question of whether the AI industry has developed a perpetual motion machine. (On this subject, I’ve been enjoying articles questioning the ability of people to relate to the word “trillion,” and I think this idea is spot on. A million dollars is a dollar a second for 11.6 days. A billion dollars is a dollar a second for 31.7 years. We get that. But a trillion dollars is a dollar a second for 31,700 years. Who can get their head around the significance of 31,700 years?) What will be the useful life of AI assets? We have to wonder whether the topic of obsolescence is being handled correctly in AI-land. What will be the lifespan of AI chips? How many years of earnings growth should be counted on in assigning p/e ratios for AI-related stocks? Will chips and other aspects of AI infrastructure last long enough to repay the debt undertaken to buy them? Will artificial general intelligence (a machine capable of doing anything the human brain can do) be achieved? Will that be the end of progress, or might there be further revolutions, and what firms will win them? Will firms reach a position where technology is stable and they can extract economic value from it? Or will new technologies continually threaten to supplant older ones as the route to success? In this connection, a single issue of an FT newsletter briefly mentioned two developments that suggest the fluid nature of the competitive landscape: A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI – the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. . . . Nvidia shares fell sharply yesterday on fears that Google is gaining ground in artificial intelligence, erasing $115bn in market value from the AI chipmaker. (FirstFT Americas, November 26) Dynamic change creates the opportunity for incredible new technologies, but that same dynamism can threaten the leading companies’ reign. Amid all these uncertainties, investors must ask whether the assumption of continued success incorporated in the prices they’re paying is fully warranted. Is exuberance leading to speculative behavior? For an extreme example, I’ll cite the trend toward venture capital investments in startups via $1 billion “seed rounds.” Here’s one vignette: Thinking Machines, an AI startup helmed by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, just raised the largest seed round in history: $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation. The company has not released a product and has refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we're doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.’ ” (“The Is How the AI Bubble Will Pop,” Derek Thompson Substack, October 2) But that’s ancient history. . . already two months old. Here’s an update: Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, is in early talks to raise a new funding round at a roughly $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The startup was last valued at $12 billion in July, after it raised about $2 billion. (Reuters, November 13) And Thinking Machines Lab isn’t alone: In one of the boldest bets yet in the AI arms race, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the stealth startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $2 billion in a round that values the company at $32 billion – despite having no publicly released product or service. (CTech by Calcalist, April 13) What’s the end state? Part of the issue with AI includes the unusual nature of this newest thing. This isn’t like a business that designs and sells a product, making money if the selling price exceeds the cost of the inputs. Rather, it’s companies building an airplane while it’s in flight, and once it’s built, they’ll know what it can do and whether anyone will pay for its services. Many companies justify their spending because they’re not just building a product, they’re creating something that will change the world: artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. . . . The rub is that none of them quite know how to do it. But Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia, said the spending would all be justified if Silicon Valley reached its goal. He is optimistic it can be done. “It’s a bet on A.G.I. or bust,” Dr. Korinek said. (The New York Times, November 20 – emphasis added) The yet-to-be-determined nature of the industry under construction is best captured in remarks from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, that have been paraphrased as follows: “we’ll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.” This should be a source of pause for people who heretofore fully comprehended the nature of the businesses they invested in. Clearly, the value of a technology that equals or surpasses the human brain should be pretty big, but isn’t it well beyond calculation? A Word About the Use of Debt To date, much of the investment in AI and the supporting infrastructure has consisted of equity capital derived from operating cash flow. But now, companies are committing amounts that require debt financing, and for some of those companies, the investments and leverage have to be described as aggressive. The AI data centre boom was never going to be financed with cash alone. The project is too big to be paid for out of pocket. JPMorgan analysts have done some sums on the back of a napkin, or possibly a tablecloth, and estimated the bill for the infrastructure build-out would come to $5tn (not including a tip). Who knows if that’s right, but we have good reason to expect close to half a trillion in spending next year. Meanwhile, the biggest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Oracle) had only about $350bn in the bank, collectively, as of the end of the third quarter. (“Unhedged,” Financial Times, November 13) The firms mentioned above derive healthy cash flows from their very strong non-AI businesses. But the massive, winner-take-all arms race in AI is requiring some to take on debt. In fact, it’s reasonable to think one of the reasons they’re spending vast sums is to make it hard for lesser firms to keep up. Oracle, Meta, and Alphabet have issued 30-year bonds to finance AI investments. In the case of the latter two, the yields on the bonds exceed those on Treasurys of like maturity by 100 basis points or less. Is it prudent to accept 30 years of technological uncertainty to make a fixed-income investment that yields little more than riskless debt? And will the investments funded with debt – in chips and data centers – maintain their level of productivity long enough for these 30-year obligations to be repaid? On November 14, Alex Kantrowitz’s Big Technology Podcast carried a conversation with Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at financial services firm D.A. Davidson, primarily regarding the use of debt in the AI sector. Here’s some of what Luria had to say: Healthy behavior is being practiced by “. . . reasonable, thoughtful business leaders, like the ones at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google that are making sound investments in growing the capacity to deliver AI. And the reason they can make sound investments is that they have all the customers. . . And so, when they make investments, they’re using cash on their balance sheets; they have tremendous cash flow to back it up; they understand that it’s a risky investment; and they balance it out.” Unhealthy behavior – Here he describes “. . . a startup that is borrowing money to build data centers for another startup. They’re both losing tremendous amounts of cash, and yet they’re somehow being able to raise this debt capital in order to fund this buildout, again without having the customers or the visibility into those investments paying off.” “So there’s a whole range of behaviors between healthy and unhealthy, and we just need to sort that out so we don’t make the mistakes of the past.” “There are certain things we finance through equity, through ownership, and there are certain things we finance through debt, through an obligation to pay down interest over time. And as a society, for the longest time, we’ve had those two pieces in their right place. Debt is when I have a predictable cash flow and/or an asset that can back that loan, and then it makes sense for me to exchange capital now for future cash flows to the lender. . . . We use equity for investing in more speculative things, for when we want to grow and we want to own that growth, but we’re not sure about what the cash flow is going to be. That’s how a normal economy functions. When you start confusing the two you get yourself in trouble.” Among potentially worrisome factors, Luria cites these: “A speculative asset . . . we don’t know how much of it we’re really going to need in two to five years.” Lender personnel with incentives to make loans but no exposure to long-term consequences The possibility that the supply of AI capacity catches up with or surpasses the demand The chance that future generations of AI chips will be more powerful, obsoleting existing ones or reducing their value as backing for debt Powerful competitors who vie for market share by cutting rental rates and running losses Here are some important paragraphs from Azeem Azhar’s Exponential View of October 18: When does an AI boom tip into a bubble? [Investor and engineer] Paul Kedrosky points to the Minsky moment – the inflection point when credit expansion exhausts its good projects and starts chasing bad ones, funding marginal deals with vendor financing and questionable coverage ratios. For AI infrastructure, that shift may already be underway; the telltale signs include hyperscalers’ capex outpacing revenue momentum and lenders sweetening terms to keep the party alive. Paul makes a compelling case. We’ve entered speculative finance territory – arguably past the tentative stage – and recent deals will set dangerous precedents. As Paul warns, this financing will “create templates for future such transactions,” spurring rapid expansion in junk issuance and SPV proliferation among hyperscalers chasing dominance at any cost. . . . For AI infrastructure, the warning signs are flashing: vendor financing proliferates, coverage ratios thin, and hyperscalers leverage balance sheets to maintain capex velocity even as revenue momentum lags. We see both sides – genuine infrastructure expansion alongside financing gymnastics that recall the 2000 telecom bust. The boom may yet prove productive, but only if revenue catches up before credit tightens. When does healthy strain become systemic risk? That’s the question we must answer before the market does. (Emphasis added) Azhar references the use of off-balance sheet financing via special-purpose vehicles, or SPVs, which were among the biggest contributors to Enron’s precariousness and eventual collapse. A company and its partners set up an SPV for some specific purpose(s) and supply the equity capital. The parent company may have operating control, but because it doesn’t have majority ownership, it doesn’t consolidate the SPV on its financial statements. The SPV takes on debt, but that debt doesn’t appear on the parent’s books. The parent may be an investment grade borrower, but likewise, the debt isn’t an obligation of the parent or guaranteed by it. Today’s debt may be backed by promised rent from a data center tenant – sometimes an equity partner – but the debt isn’t a direct obligation of the equity partner either. Essentially, an SPV is a way to make it look like a company isn’t doing the things the SPV is doing and doesn’t have the debt the SPV does. (Private equity funds and private credit funds are highly likely to be found among the partners and lenders in these entities.) As I quoted earlier, according to Perez (who wrote on the heels of the dot-com bubble), “what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments.” Early investment is lost in the “Minsky moment,” in which unwise commitments made in an extended up-cycle encounters value destruction in a correction. And there are three things we know for sure about the use of debt: it magnifies losses if there are losses (just as it magnifies the hoped-for gains if they materialize), it increases the probability of a venture failing if it encounters a difficult moment, and despite the layer of equity beneath it, it puts lenders’ capital at risk if the difficult moment is bad enough. One key risk to consider is the possibility that the boom in data center construction will result in a glut. Some data centers may be rendered uneconomic, and some owners may go bankrupt. In that case, a new generation of owners might buy up centers at pennies on the dollar from lenders who foreclosed on them, reaping profits when the industry stabilizes. This is a process through which “creative destruction” brings markets into equilibrium and reduces costs to levels that make future business profitable. Debt is neither a good thing nor a bad thing per se. Likewise, the use of leverage in the AI industry shouldn’t be applauded or feared. It all comes down to the proportion of debt in the capital structure; the quality of the assets or cash flows you’re lending against; the borrowers’ alternative sources of liquidity for repayment; and the adequacy of the safety margin obtained by lenders. We’ll see which lenders maintain discipline in today’s heady environment. It’s worth noting in this connection that Oaktree has made a few investments in data centers, and our parent, Brookfield, is raising a $10 billion fund for investment in AI infrastructure. Brookfield is putting up its own money and has equity commitments from sovereign wealth funds and Nvidia, to which it intends to apply “prudent” debt. Brookfield’s investments seem likely to go largely into geographies that are less saturated with data centers and for infrastructure to supply the vast amounts of electric power that data centers will require. Of course, we’re both doing these things on the basis of what we think are prudent decisions. I know I don’t know enough to opine on AI. But I do know something about debt, and it’s this: It’s okay to supply debt financing for a venture where the outcome is uncertain. It’s not okay where the outcome is purely a matter of conjecture. Those who understand the difference still have to make the distinction correctly. The FT’s Unhedged quotes Chong Sin, lead analyst for CMBS research at JPMorgan, as saying, “. . . in our conversations with investment grade ABS and CMBS investors, one often-cited concern is whether they want to take on the residual value risk of data centers when the bonds mature.” I’m glad potential lenders are asking the kind of questions they should. Here’s how to think about the intersection of debt and AI according to Bob O’Leary, Oaktree’s co-CEO and co-portfolio manager of our Opportunities Funds: Most technological advances develop into winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most competitions. The “right” way to play this dynamic is through equity, not debt. Assuming you can diversify your equity exposures so as to include the eventual winner, the massive gain from the winner will more than compensate for the capital impairment on the losers. That’s the venture capitalist’s time-honored formula for success. The precise opposite is true of a diversified pool of debt exposures. You’ll only make your coupon on the winner, and that will be grossly insufficient to compensate for the impairments you’ll experience on the debt of the losers. Of course, if you can’t identify the pool of companies from which the winner will emerge, the difference between debt and equity is irrelevant – you’re a zero either way. I mention this because that’s precisely what happened in search and social media: early leaders (Lycos in search and MySpace in social media) lost out spectacularly to companies that emerged later (Google in search and Facebook in social media). Trying to Get to a Conclusion There can be no doubt that today’s behavior is “speculative,” defined as based on speculation regarding the future. There’s also no doubt that no one knows what the future holds, but investors are betting huge sums on that future. In that connection, I want to say a little about the unique nature of AI. The AI revolution is different from the technological revolutions that preceded it in ways that are both wonderful and worrisome. It feels to me like a genie has been released from a bottle, and it isn’t going back in: AI may not be a tool for mankind, but rather something of a replacement. It may be capable of taking over cognition, on which humans have thus far had a monopoly. Because of this, it’s likely to be different in kind from prior developments, not just in degree. (More on this in my postscript.) AI technology is progressing at an incredibly rapid clip, possibly leaving scant time for mankind to adjust. I’ll provide two examples: Coding, which we called “computer programming” 60 years ago, is the canary in the coal mine in terms of the impact of AI. In many advanced software teams, developers no longer write the code; they type in what they want, and AI systems generate the code for them. Coding performed by AI is at a world-class level, something that wasn’t so just a year ago. According to my guide here, “There is no speculation about whether or not human replacement will take place in that vertical.” In the field of digital advertising, when users log into an app, AI engages in “ad matching,” showing them ads tailored to the preferences displayed by their prior surfing. No humans need apply to do this job. Perhaps most importantly, the growth of demand for AI seems totally unpredictable. As one of my younger advisers explained, “the speed and scale of improvement mean it’s incredibly hard to forecast demand for AI. Adoption today may have nothing to do with adoption tomorrow, because a year or two from now, AI may be able to do 10x or 100x what it can do today. Thus, how can anyone say how many data centers will be needed? And how can even successful companies know how much computing capacity to contract for?” With differences like these, how can anyone correctly judge what AI implies for the future? * * * One of the things occupying many observers at this juncture – including me – is the search for parallels to past bubbles. Here’s some historical perspective from a recent article in Wired: AI’s closest historical analogue here may be not electric lighting but radio. When RCA started broadcasting in 1919, it was immediately clear that it had a powerful information technology on its hands. But less clear was how that would translate into business. “Would radio be a loss-leading marketing for department stores? A public service for broadcasting Sunday sermons? An ad-supported medium for entertainment?” [Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch of the University of Maryland] write. “All were possible. All were subjects of technological narratives.” As a result, radio turned into one of the biggest bubbles in history – peaking in 1929, before losing 97 percent of its value in the crash. This wasn’t an incidental sector; RCA was, along with Ford Motor Company, the most high-traded stock on the market. It was, as The New Yorker recently wrote, “the Nvidia of its day.” . . . In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. . . . It was the biggest tech demo of the day, and it became an enormous, ChatGPT-launch-level coordinating event – a signal to investors to pour money into the industry. “Expert investors appreciated correctly the importance of airplanes and air travel,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write, but “the narrative of inevitability largely drowned out their caution. Technological uncertainty was framed as opportunity, not risk. The market overestimated how quickly the industry would achieve technological viability and profitability.” As a result, the bubble burst in 1929 – from its peak in May, aviation stocks dropped 96 percent by May 1932. . . . It’s worth reiterating that two of the closest analogs AI seems to have in tech bubble history are aviation and broadcast radio. Both were wrapped in high degrees of uncertainty and both were hyped with incredibly powerful coordinating narratives. Both were seized on by pure play companies seeking to capitalize on the new game-changing tech, and both were accessible to the retail investors of the day. Both helped inflate a bubble so big that when it burst, in 1929, it left us with the Great Depression. (“AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All,” Brian Merchant, Wired, October 27 – emphasis added. N.b., the Depression had many causes beyond the bursting of the radio/aviation bubble.) Derek Thompson, who supplied the quote with which I opened this memo, ended his newsletter with some terrific historical perspective: The railroads were a bubble and they transformed America. Electricity was a bubble, and it transformed America. The broadband build-out of the late-1990s was a bubble that transformed America. I am not rooting for a bubble, and quite the contrary, I hope that the US economy doesn’t experience another recession for many years. But given the amount of debt now flowing into AI data center construction, I think it’s unlikely that AI will be the first transformative technology that isn’t overbuilt and doesn’t incur a brief painful correction. (“AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself.” November 4 – emphasis added) The skeptics readily cite ways in which today’s events are comparable to the internet bubble: A change-the-world technology Exuberant, speculative behavior The role of FOMO Suspect, circular deals The use of SPVs $1 billion seed rounds The supporters have reasons why the comparison isn’t appropriate: An existing product for which there is strong demand One billion users already (many times the number of internet users at the height of the bubble) Well-established main players with revenues, profits, and cash flow The absence of an IPO craze with prices doubling in a day Reasonable p/e ratios for the established participants I’ll elaborate regarding the first of the proposed non-comparable factors. Unlike in the internet bubble, AI products already exist at scale, the demand for them is exploding, and they’re producing revenues in rapidly increasing amounts. For example, Anthropic, one of the two leaders in producing models for AI coding as described on page 12, is said to have “10x-ed” its revenues in each of the last two years (for those who didn’t study higher math, that’s 100x in two years). Revenues from Claude Code, a program for coding that Anthropic introduced earlier this year, already are said to be running at an annual rate of $1 billion. Revenues for the other leader, Cursor, were $1 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024, and they, too, are expected to reach $1 billion this year. As to the final bullet point, see the table below, which comes from Goldman Sachs via Derek Thompson. You’ll notice that during the internet bubble of 1998-2000, the p/e ratios were much higher for Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle than they are today for the biggest AI players – Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta (OpenAI doesn’t have earnings). In fact, Microsoft’s on a half-off sale relative to its p/e 26 years ago! In the first bubble I witnessed – surrounding the Nifty-Fifty in 1969-72 – the p/e ratios for the leading companies were even higher than those of 1998-2000. In Conclusion For my final citation, I’ll look to Sam Altman of OpenAI. His comments seem to me to capture the essence of what’s going on: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Mr. Altman told reporters this year. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about A.I.? My opinion is yes. Is A.I. the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” (The New York Times, November 20) But do I have a bottom line? Yes, I do. Alan Greenspan’s phrase, mentioned earlier, serves as an excellent way to sum up a stock market bubble: “irrational exuberance.” There is no doubt that investors are applying exuberance with regard to AI. The question is whether it’s irrational. Given the vast potential of AI but also the large number of enormous unknowns, I think virtually no one can say for sure. We can theorize about whether the current enthusiasm is excessive, but we won’t know until years from now whether it was. Bubbles are best identified in retrospect. While the parallels to past bubbles are inescapable, believers in the technology will argue that “this time it’s different.” Those four words are heard in virtually every bubble, explaining why the present situation isn’t a bubble, unlike the analogous prior ones. On the other hand, Sir John Templeton, who in 1987 drew my attention to those four words, was quick to point out that 20% of the time things really are different. But on the third hand, it must be borne in mind that behavior based on the belief that it’s different is what causes it to not be different! Today’s situation calls to mind a comment attributed to American economist Stuart Chase about faith. I believe it’s also applicable to AI (as well as to gold and cryptocurrencies): For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible. Here’s my actual bottom line: There’s a consistent history of transformational technologies generating excessive enthusiasm and investment, resulting in more infrastructure than is needed and asset prices that prove to have been too high. The excesses accelerate the adoption of the technology in a way that wouldn’t occur in their absence. The common word for these excesses is “bubbles.” AI has the potential to be one of the greatest transformational technologies of all time. As I wrote just above, AI is currently the subject of great enthusiasm. If that enthusiasm doesn’t produce a bubble conforming to the historical pattern, that will be a first. Bubbles created in this process usually end in losses for those who fuel them. The losses stem largely from the fact that the technology’s newness renders the extent and timing of its impact unpredictable. This in turn makes it easy to judge companies too positively amid all the enthusiasm and difficult to know which will emerge as winners when the dust settles. There can be no way to participate fully in the potential benefits from the new technology without being exposed to the losses that will arise if the enthusiasm and thus investors’ behavior prove to have been excessive. The use of debt in this process – which the high level of uncertainty usually precluded in past technological revolutions – has the potential to magnify all of the above this time. Since no one can say definitively whether this is a bubble, I’d advise that no one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the risk of ruin if things go badly. But by the same token, no one should stay all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps forward. A moderate position, applied with selectivity and prudence, seems like the best approach. Finally, it’s essential to bear in mind that there are no magic words in investing. These days, people promoting real estate funds say, “Office buildings are so yesterday, but we’re investing in the future through data centers,” whereupon everyone nods in agreement. But data centers can be in shortage or in oversupply, and rental rates can surprise to the upside or the downside. As a result, they can be profitable . . . or not. Intelligent investment in data centers, and thus in AI – like everything else – requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful implementation. December 9, 2025 P.S.: The following has nothing to do with the financial markets or the question of whether AI is the subject of a bubble. My topic is the impact of AI on society through joblessness and purposelessness. You needn’t read it – that’s why it’s a postscript – but it’s important to me, and I've been looking for a place to say a few words about it. On November 18, a research note from Barclays described Fed Governor Christopher Waller as having “highlighted how recent stock market enthusiasm around AI has not yet translated into job creation.” This strikes me as paradoxical given my sense that one of AI’s main impacts will be to increase productivity and thus eliminate jobs. That is the source of my concern. I view AI primarily as an incredible labor-saving device. Joe Davis, Global Chief Economist and Global Head of the Investment Strategy Group at Vanguard, says, “for most jobs – likely four out of five – AI’s impact will result in a mixture of innovation and automation, and could save about 43% of the time people currently spend on their work tasks.” (Exponential View, September 3) I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can’t find jobs because of it. The optimists argue that “new jobs have always materialized after past technological advances.” I hope that’ll hold true in the case of AI, but hope isn’t much to hang one’s hat on, and I have trouble figuring out where those jobs will come from. Of course, I’m not much of a futurist or a financial optimist, and that’s why it’s a good thing I shifted from equities to bonds in 1978. The other thing the optimists say is that “the beneficial impact of AI on productivity will cause a huge acceleration in GDP growth.” Here I have specific quibbles: The change in GDP can be thought of as the change in hours worked times the change in output per hour (aka “productivity”). The role of AI in increasing productivity means it will take fewer hours worked – meaning fewer workers – to produce the goods we need. Or, viewed from the other direction, maybe the boom in productivity will mean a lot more goods can be produced with the same amount of labor. But if a lot of jobs are lost to AI, how will people be able to afford the additional goods AI enables to be produced? I find it hard to imagine a world in which AI works shoulder-to-shoulder with all the people who are employed today. How can employment not decline? AI is likely to replace large numbers of entry-level workers, people who process paper without applying judgment, and junior lawyers who scour the lawbooks for precedents. Maybe even junior investment analysts who create spreadsheets and compile presentation materials. It’s said that AI can read an MRI better than the average doctor. Driving is one of the most populous professions in America, and driverless vehicles are already arriving; where will all the people who currently drive taxis, limos, buses, and trucks find jobs? I imagine government’s response will be something called “universal basic income.” The government will simply mail checks to the millions for whom there are no jobs. But the worrier in me finds problems in this, too: Where will the money come from for those checks? The job losses I foresee imply reduced income tax receipts and increased spending on entitlements. This puts a further burden on the declining segment of the population that is working and implies even greater deficits ahead. In this new world, will governments be able to fund ever-increasing deficits? And more importantly, people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck. A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect, and presents them with challenges, the overcoming of which provides satisfaction. How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day. I worry about the correlation between the loss of jobs in mining and manufacturing in recent decades and the incidence of opioid addiction and shortening of lifespans. And by the way, if we eliminate large numbers of junior lawyers, analysts, and doctors, where will we get the experienced veterans capable of solving serious problems requiring judgment and pattern recognition honed over decades? What jobs won’t be eliminated? What careers should our children and grandchildren prepare for? Think about the jobs that machines can’t perform. My list starts with plumbers, electricians, and masseurs –physical tasks. Maybe nurses will earn more than doctors because they deliver hands-on care. And what distinguishes the best artists, athletes, doctors, lawyers, and hopefully investors? I think it’s something called talent or insight, which AI might or might not be able to replicate. But how many people at the top of those professions are needed? A past presidential candidate said he would give laptops to everyone who lost their job to offshoring. How many laptop operators do we need? Finally, I’m concerned that a small number of highly educated multi-billionaires living on the coasts will be viewed as having created technology that puts millions out of work. This promises even more social and political division than we have now, making the world ripe for populist demagoguery. I’ve seen incredible progress over the course of my lifetime, but in many ways I miss the simpler world I grew up in. I worry that this will be another big one. I get no pleasure from this recitation. Will the optimists please explain why I’m wrong? Interestingly in this connection, Vanguard’s Joe Davis points out that more Americans are turning 65 in 2025 than in any preceding year, and that approximately 16 million baby boomers will retire between now and 2035. Could AI merely make up for that? There’s an optimistic take for you.

Title: Is It a Bubble? By Howard Marks

Full Content:
Ours is a remarkable moment in world history. A transformative technology is ascending, and its supporters claim it will forever change the world. To build it requires companies to invest a sum of money unlike anything in living memory. News reports are filled with widespread fears that America’s biggest corporations are propping up a bubble that will soon pop. During my visits to clients in Asia and the Middle East last month, I was often asked about the possibility of a bubble surrounding artificial intelligence, and my discussions gave rise to this memo. I want to start off with my usual caveats: I’m not active in the stock market; I merely watch it as the best barometer of investor psychology. I’m also no techie, and I don’t know any more about AI than most generalist investors. But I’ll do my best. One of the most interesting aspects of bubbles is their regularity, not in terms of timing, but rather the progression they follow. Something new and seemingly revolutionary appears and worms its way into people’s minds. It captures their imagination, and the excitement is overwhelming. The early participants enjoy huge gains. Those who merely look on feel incredible envy and regret and – motivated by the fear of continuing to miss out – pile in. They do this without knowledge of what the future will bring or concern about whether the price they’re paying can possibly be expected to produce a reasonable return with a tolerable amount of risk. The end result for investors is inevitably painful in the short to medium term, although it’s possible to end up ahead after enough years have passed. I’ve lived through several bubbles and read about others, and they’ve all hewed to this description. One might think the losses experienced when past bubbles popped would discourage the next one from forming. But that hasn’t happened yet, and I’m sure it never will. Memories are short, and prudence and natural risk aversion are no match for the dream of getting rich on the back of a revolutionary technology that “everyone knows” will change the world. I took the quote that opens this memo from Derek Thompson’s November 4 newsletter entitled “AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself,” about parallels between what’s going on today in AI and the railroad boom of the 1860s. Its word-for-word applicability to both shows clearly what’s meant by the phrase widely attributed to Mark Twain: “history rhymes.” Understanding Bubbles Before diving into the subject at hand – and having read a great deal about it in preparation – I want to start with a point of clarification. Everyone asks, “Is there a bubble in AI?” I think there’s ambiguity even in the question. I’ve concluded there are two different but interrelated bubble possibilities to think about: one in the behavior of companies within the industry, and the other in how investors are behaving with regard to the industry. I have absolutely no ability to judge whether the AI companies’ aggressive behavior is justified, so I’ll try to stick primarily to the question of whether there’s a bubble around AI in the financial world. The main job of an investment analyst – especially in the so-called “value” school to which I subscribe – is to (a) study companies and other assets and assess the level of and outlook for their intrinsic value and (b) make investment decisions on the basis of that value. Most of the change the analyst encounters in the short to medium term surrounds the asset’s price and its relationship to underlying value. That relationship, in turn, is essentially the result of investor psychology. Market bubbles aren’t caused directly by technological or financial developments. Rather, they result from the application of excessive optimism to those developments. As I wrote in my January memo On Bubble Watch, bubbles are temporary manias in which developments in those areas become the subject of what former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called “irrational exuberance.’’ Bubbles usually coalesce around new financial developments (e.g., the South Sea Company of the early 1700s or sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities in 2005-06) or technological progress (optical fiber in the late 1990s and the internet in 1998-2000). Newness plays a huge part in this. Because there’s no history to restrain the imagination, the future can appear limitless for the new thing. And futures that are perceived to be limitless can justify valuations that go well beyond past norms – leading to asset prices that aren’t justified on the basis of predictable earning power. The role of newness is well described in my favorite passage from a book that greatly influenced me, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith wrote about what he called “the extreme brevity of the financial memory” and pointed out that in the financial markets, “past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” In other words, history can impose limits on awe regarding the present and imagination regarding the future. In the absence of history, on the other hand, all things seem possible. The key thing to note here is that the new thing understandably inspires great enthusiasm, but bubbles are what happen when the enthusiasm reaches irrational proportions. Who can identify the boundary of rationality? Who can say when an optimistic market has become a bubble? It’s just a matter of judgment. Something that occurred to me this past month is that two of my best “calls” came in 2000, when I cautioned about what was going on in the market for tech and internet stocks, and in 2005-07, when I cited the dearth of risk aversion and the resulting ease of doing crazy deals in the pre-Global Financial Crisis world. First, in neither case did I possess any expertise regarding the things that turned out to be the subjects of the bubbles: the internet and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. All I did was render observations regarding the behavior taking place around me. And second, the value in my calls consisted mostly of describing the folly in that behavior, not in insisting that it had brought on a bubble. Struggling with whether to apply the “bubble” label can bog you down and interfere with proper judgment; we can accomplish a great deal by merely assessing what’s going on around us and drawing inferences with regard to proper behavior. What’s Good About Bubbles? Before going on to discuss AI and whether it’s presently in a bubble, I want to spend a little time on a subject that may seem somewhat academic from the standpoint of investors: the upside of bubbles. You may find the attention I devote to this topic excessive, but I do so because I find it fascinating. The November 5 Stratechery newsletter was entitled “The Benefits of Bubbles.” In it, Ben Thompson (no relation to Derek) cites a book titled Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation. It was written by Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, who propose that there are two kinds of bubbles: . . . “Inflection Bubbles” – the good kind of bubbles, as opposed to the much more damaging “Mean-reversion Bubbles” like the 2000’s subprime mortgage bubble. I find this a useful dichotomy. The financial fads I’ve read about or witnessed – the South Sea Company, portfolio insurance, and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities – stirred the imagination based on the promise of returns without risk, but there was no expectation that they would represent overall progress for mankind. There was, for example, no thought that housing would be revolutionized by the sub-prime mortgage movement, merely a feeling that there was money to be made from backing new buyers. Hobart and Huber call these “mean-reverting bubbles,” presumably because there’s no expectation that the underlying developments would move the world forward. Fads merely rise and fall. On the other hand, Hobart and Huber call bubbles based on technological progress – as in the case of the railroads and the internet – “inflection bubbles.” After an inflection-driven bubble, the world will not revert to its prior state. In such a bubble, “investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past and trade accordingly.” As Thompson tells us: The definitive book on bubbles has long been Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. Bubbles were – are – thought to be something negative and to be avoided, particularly at the time Perez published her book. The year was 2002 and much of the world was in a recession coming off the puncturing of the dot-com bubble. Perez didn’t deny the pain: in fact, she noted that similar crashes marked previous revolutions, including the Industrial Revolution, railways, electricity, and the automobile. In each case the bubbles were not regrettable, but necessary: the speculative mania enabled what Perez called the “Installation Phase,” where necessary but not necessarily financially wise investments laid the groundwork for the “Deployment Period.” What marked the shift to the deployment period was the popping of the bubble; what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments. (All emphasis added) This distinction is very meaningful for Hobart and Huber, and I agree. They say, “not all bubbles destroy wealth and value. Some can be understood as important catalysts for techno-scientific progress.” But I would restate as follows: “Mean-reversion bubbles” – in which markets soar on the basis of some new financial miracle and then collapse – destroy wealth. On the other hand, “inflection bubbles” based on revolutionary developments accelerate technological progress and create the foundation for a more prosperous future, and they destroy wealth. The key is to not be one of the investors whose wealth is destroyed in the process of bringing on progress. Hobart and Huber go on to describe in greater depth the process through which bubbles finance the building of the infrastructure required by the new technology and thus accelerate its adoption: Most novel technology doesn’t just appear ex nihilo [i.e., from nothing], entering the world fully formed and all at once. Rather, it builds on previous false starts, failures, iterations, and historical path dependencies. Bubbles create opportunities to deploy the capital necessary to fund and speed up such large-scale experimentation – which includes lots of trial and error done in parallel – thereby accelerating the rate of potentially disruptive technologies and breakthroughs. By generating positive feedback cycles of enthusiasm and investment, bubbles can be net beneficial. Optimism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Speculation provides the massive financing needed to fund highly risky and exploratory projects; what appears in the short term to be excessive enthusiasm or just bad investing turns out to be essential for bootstrapping social and technological innovations . . . A bubble can be a collective delusion, but it can also be an expression of collective vision. That vision becomes a site of coordination for people and capital and for the parallelization of innovation. Instead of happening over time, bursts of progress happen simultaneously across different domains. And with mounting enthusiasm . . . comes increased risk tolerance and strong network effects. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, attracts even more participants, entrepreneurs, and speculators, further reinforcing this positive feedback loop. Like bubbles, FOMO tends to have a bad reputation, but it’s sometimes a healthy instinct. After all, none of us wants to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build the future. In other words, bubbles based on technological progress are good because they excite investors into pouring in money – a good bit of which is thrown away – to carpet-bomb a new area of opportunity and thus jump-start its exploitation. The key realization seems to be that if people remained patient, prudent, analytical, and value-insistent, novel technologies would take many years and perhaps decades to be built out. Instead, the hysteria of the bubble causes the process to be compressed into a very short period – with some of the money going into life-changing investment in the winners but a lot of it being incinerated. A bubble has aspects that are both technological and financial, but the above citations are from the standpoint of people who crave technological progress and are perfectly happy to see investors lose money in its interest. “We,” on the other hand, would like to see technological progress but have no desire to throw away money to help bring it about. Ben Thompson ends this discussion by saying, “This is why I’m excited to talk about new technologies, the prospect for which I don’t know.” I love the fact that he’s excited by future possibilities and at the same time admits that the shape of the future is unknown (in our world, we might say “very risky”). Assessing the Current Landscape Now let’s get down to what we used to call “brass tacks.” What do we know? First, I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t believe artificial intelligence has the potential to be one of the biggest technological developments of all time, reshaping both daily life and the global economy. We also know that in recent years, economies and markets have become increasingly dependent on AI: AI is responsible for a very large portion of companies’ total capital expenditures. Capital expenditures on AI capacity account for a large share of the growth in U.S. GDP. AI stocks have been the source of the vast majority of the gains of the S&P 500. As a Fortune headline put it on October 7: 75% of gains, 80% of profits, 90% of capex – AI’s grip on the S&P is total and Morgan Stanley’s top analyst is ‘very concerned’ Further, I think it’s important to note that whereas the gains in AI-related stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of the total gains in all stocks, the excitement AI injects into the market must have added a lot to the appreciation of non-AI stocks as well. AI-related stocks have shown astronomical performance, led by Nvidia, the leading developer of computer chips for AI. From its formation in 1993 and its initial public offering in 1999, when its estimated market value was $626 million, Nvidia briefly became the world’s first company worth $5 trillion. That’s appreciation of around 8,000x, or roughly 40% a year for 26+ years. No wonder imaginations have been fired. What Are the Areas of Uncertainty? I think it’s fair to say that while we know AI will be a source of incredible change, most of us have no idea exactly what it will be able to do, how it will be applied commercially, or what the timing will be. Who will be the winners, and what will they be worth? If a new technology is assumed to be a world changer, it’s invariably assumed that the leading companies possessing that technology will be of great value. But how accurate will that assumption prove to be? As Warren Buffett pointed out in 1999, “[The automobile was] the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the 20th century. . . . If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the 2,000 companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. So autos had an enormous impact on America but the opposite direction on investors.” (Time, January 23, 2012) In AI, there are some very strong leaders at present, including some of the world’s strongest and richest companies. But new technology is notoriously disruptive. Will today’s leaders prevail or give way to upstarts? How much will the arms race cost, and who will win? Similarly, what’s a share in an upstart worth? Unlike front runners worth trillions, it’s possible to invest in some would-be challengers at enterprise values in mere billions or even – might I say? – millions. On June 25, 2024, CNBC reported as follows: A team founded by college dropouts has raised $120 million from investors led by Primary Venture Partners to build a new AI chip to take on Nvidia. Etched CEO Gavin Uberti said the startup is betting that as AI develops, most of the technology’s power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. “If transformers go away, we’ll die,” Uberti told CNBC. “But if they stick around, we’re the biggest company of all time.” Even granting the possibility that Etched won’t become the biggest company of all time, if success could give them a valuation just one-fifth of Nvidia’s peak – a mere $1 trillion – what probability of success would be required to justify an investment of $120 million? Assuming for simplicity’s sake that the investment was for a 100% ownership stake, all you need is a belief that achieving the trillion-dollar value has a probability of one-tenth of a percent for an expected return of over eight times your money. Who’s to say Etched doesn’t have that chance? And in that case, why would anyone not play? The foregoing is what I call “lottery-ticket thinking,” in which the dream of an enormous payoff justifies – no, compels – participation in an endeavor with an overwhelming probability of failing. There’s nothing wrong with calculating expected values this way. Leading venture capitalists engage in it every day to great effect. But assumptions regarding the possible payoffs and their probabilities must be reasonable. Thinking about a trillion-dollar payout will override reasonableness in any calculation. Will AI produce profits, and for whom? Two things we know little or nothing about are the profits AI will produce for vendors and its impact on non-AI companies, primarily meaning those who employ it. Will AI be a monopoly or duopoly, in which one or two leading companies are able to charge dearly for the capabilities? Or will it be a highly competitive free-for-all in which a number of firms compete on price for users’ spending on AI services, making it a commodity? Or, perhaps most likely, will it be a mix of leading companies and specialized players, some of whom compete on price and others through proprietary advantages. It’s said that the services currently responding to AI queries, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, lose money on every query they answer (of course, it’s not unusual for participants in a new industry to offer “loss leaders” for a while). Will the leading tech firms – used to success in winner-take-all markets – be content to experience losses in their AI businesses for years in order to gain share? Hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to the race for AI leadership. Who will win, and what will be the result? Likewise, what will be AI’s impact on the companies that use it? Clearly, AI will be a great tool for enhancing users’ productivity by, among other things, replacing workers with computer-sourced labor and intelligence. But will this ability to cut costs add to the profit margins of the companies that employ it? Or will it simply enable price wars among those companies in the pursuit of customers? In that case, the savings might be passed on to the customers rather than garnered by the companies. In other words, is it possible AI will increase the efficiency of businesses without increasing their profitability? Should we worry about so-called “circular deals”? In the telecom boom of the late 1990s, in which optical fiber became overbuilt, fiber-owning companies engaged in transactions with each other that permitted them to report profits. If two companies own fiber, they just have an asset on their books. But if each buys capacity from the other, they can both report profits . . . so they did. In other cases, manufacturers loaned network operators money to buy equipment from them, before the operators had customers to justify the buildout. All this resulted in profits that were illusory. Nowadays, deals are being announced in which money appears to be round-tripped between AI players. People who believe there’s an AI bubble find it easy to view these transactions with suspicion. Is the purpose to achieve legitimate business goals or to exaggerate progress? Adding to worries, critics say, some of the deals that OpenAI has made with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others are oddly circular. OpenAI is set to receive billions from tech companies but also sends billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. . . . Nvidia has also made some deals that have raised questions about whether the company is paying itself. It announced that it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips. . . . Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics also call circular deals. (The New York Times, November 20) Noteworthily, OpenAI has made investment commitments to industry counterparties totaling $1.4 trillion, even though it has yet to turn a profit. The company makes clear that the investments are to be paid out of revenues received from the same parties and that it has ways to back out of these commitments. But all this raises the question of whether the AI industry has developed a perpetual motion machine. (On this subject, I’ve been enjoying articles questioning the ability of people to relate to the word “trillion,” and I think this idea is spot on. A million dollars is a dollar a second for 11.6 days. A billion dollars is a dollar a second for 31.7 years. We get that. But a trillion dollars is a dollar a second for 31,700 years. Who can get their head around the significance of 31,700 years?) What will be the useful life of AI assets? We have to wonder whether the topic of obsolescence is being handled correctly in AI-land. What will be the lifespan of AI chips? How many years of earnings growth should be counted on in assigning p/e ratios for AI-related stocks? Will chips and other aspects of AI infrastructure last long enough to repay the debt undertaken to buy them? Will artificial general intelligence (a machine capable of doing anything the human brain can do) be achieved? Will that be the end of progress, or might there be further revolutions, and what firms will win them? Will firms reach a position where technology is stable and they can extract economic value from it? Or will new technologies continually threaten to supplant older ones as the route to success? In this connection, a single issue of an FT newsletter briefly mentioned two developments that suggest the fluid nature of the competitive landscape: A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI – the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. . . . Nvidia shares fell sharply yesterday on fears that Google is gaining ground in artificial intelligence, erasing $115bn in market value from the AI chipmaker. (FirstFT Americas, November 26) Dynamic change creates the opportunity for incredible new technologies, but that same dynamism can threaten the leading companies’ reign. Amid all these uncertainties, investors must ask whether the assumption of continued success incorporated in the prices they’re paying is fully warranted. Is exuberance leading to speculative behavior? For an extreme example, I’ll cite the trend toward venture capital investments in startups via $1 billion “seed rounds.” Here’s one vignette: Thinking Machines, an AI startup helmed by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, just raised the largest seed round in history: $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation. The company has not released a product and has refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we're doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.’ ” (“The Is How the AI Bubble Will Pop,” Derek Thompson Substack, October 2) But that’s ancient history. . . already two months old. Here’s an update: Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, is in early talks to raise a new funding round at a roughly $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The startup was last valued at $12 billion in July, after it raised about $2 billion. (Reuters, November 13) And Thinking Machines Lab isn’t alone: In one of the boldest bets yet in the AI arms race, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the stealth startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $2 billion in a round that values the company at $32 billion – despite having no publicly released product or service. (CTech by Calcalist, April 13) What’s the end state? Part of the issue with AI includes the unusual nature of this newest thing. This isn’t like a business that designs and sells a product, making money if the selling price exceeds the cost of the inputs. Rather, it’s companies building an airplane while it’s in flight, and once it’s built, they’ll know what it can do and whether anyone will pay for its services. Many companies justify their spending because they’re not just building a product, they’re creating something that will change the world: artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. . . . The rub is that none of them quite know how to do it. But Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia, said the spending would all be justified if Silicon Valley reached its goal. He is optimistic it can be done. “It’s a bet on A.G.I. or bust,” Dr. Korinek said. (The New York Times, November 20 – emphasis added) The yet-to-be-determined nature of the industry under construction is best captured in remarks from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, that have been paraphrased as follows: “we’ll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.” This should be a source of pause for people who heretofore fully comprehended the nature of the businesses they invested in. Clearly, the value of a technology that equals or surpasses the human brain should be pretty big, but isn’t it well beyond calculation? A Word About the Use of Debt To date, much of the investment in AI and the supporting infrastructure has consisted of equity capital derived from operating cash flow. But now, companies are committing amounts that require debt financing, and for some of those companies, the investments and leverage have to be described as aggressive. The AI data centre boom was never going to be financed with cash alone. The project is too big to be paid for out of pocket. JPMorgan analysts have done some sums on the back of a napkin, or possibly a tablecloth, and estimated the bill for the infrastructure build-out would come to $5tn (not including a tip). Who knows if that’s right, but we have good reason to expect close to half a trillion in spending next year. Meanwhile, the biggest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Oracle) had only about $350bn in the bank, collectively, as of the end of the third quarter. (“Unhedged,” Financial Times, November 13) The firms mentioned above derive healthy cash flows from their very strong non-AI businesses. But the massive, winner-take-all arms race in AI is requiring some to take on debt. In fact, it’s reasonable to think one of the reasons they’re spending vast sums is to make it hard for lesser firms to keep up. Oracle, Meta, and Alphabet have issued 30-year bonds to finance AI investments. In the case of the latter two, the yields on the bonds exceed those on Treasurys of like maturity by 100 basis points or less. Is it prudent to accept 30 years of technological uncertainty to make a fixed-income investment that yields little more than riskless debt? And will the investments funded with debt – in chips and data centers – maintain their level of productivity long enough for these 30-year obligations to be repaid? On November 14, Alex Kantrowitz’s Big Technology Podcast carried a conversation with Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at financial services firm D.A. Davidson, primarily regarding the use of debt in the AI sector. Here’s some of what Luria had to say: Healthy behavior is being practiced by “. . . reasonable, thoughtful business leaders, like the ones at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google that are making sound investments in growing the capacity to deliver AI. And the reason they can make sound investments is that they have all the customers. . . And so, when they make investments, they’re using cash on their balance sheets; they have tremendous cash flow to back it up; they understand that it’s a risky investment; and they balance it out.” Unhealthy behavior – Here he describes “. . . a startup that is borrowing money to build data centers for another startup. They’re both losing tremendous amounts of cash, and yet they’re somehow being able to raise this debt capital in order to fund this buildout, again without having the customers or the visibility into those investments paying off.” “So there’s a whole range of behaviors between healthy and unhealthy, and we just need to sort that out so we don’t make the mistakes of the past.” “There are certain things we finance through equity, through ownership, and there are certain things we finance through debt, through an obligation to pay down interest over time. And as a society, for the longest time, we’ve had those two pieces in their right place. Debt is when I have a predictable cash flow and/or an asset that can back that loan, and then it makes sense for me to exchange capital now for future cash flows to the lender. . . . We use equity for investing in more speculative things, for when we want to grow and we want to own that growth, but we’re not sure about what the cash flow is going to be. That’s how a normal economy functions. When you start confusing the two you get yourself in trouble.” Among potentially worrisome factors, Luria cites these: “A speculative asset . . . we don’t know how much of it we’re really going to need in two to five years.” Lender personnel with incentives to make loans but no exposure to long-term consequences The possibility that the supply of AI capacity catches up with or surpasses the demand The chance that future generations of AI chips will be more powerful, obsoleting existing ones or reducing their value as backing for debt Powerful competitors who vie for market share by cutting rental rates and running losses Here are some important paragraphs from Azeem Azhar’s Exponential View of October 18: When does an AI boom tip into a bubble? [Investor and engineer] Paul Kedrosky points to the Minsky moment – the inflection point when credit expansion exhausts its good projects and starts chasing bad ones, funding marginal deals with vendor financing and questionable coverage ratios. For AI infrastructure, that shift may already be underway; the telltale signs include hyperscalers’ capex outpacing revenue momentum and lenders sweetening terms to keep the party alive. Paul makes a compelling case. We’ve entered speculative finance territory – arguably past the tentative stage – and recent deals will set dangerous precedents. As Paul warns, this financing will “create templates for future such transactions,” spurring rapid expansion in junk issuance and SPV proliferation among hyperscalers chasing dominance at any cost. . . . For AI infrastructure, the warning signs are flashing: vendor financing proliferates, coverage ratios thin, and hyperscalers leverage balance sheets to maintain capex velocity even as revenue momentum lags. We see both sides – genuine infrastructure expansion alongside financing gymnastics that recall the 2000 telecom bust. The boom may yet prove productive, but only if revenue catches up before credit tightens. When does healthy strain become systemic risk? That’s the question we must answer before the market does. (Emphasis added) Azhar references the use of off-balance sheet financing via special-purpose vehicles, or SPVs, which were among the biggest contributors to Enron’s precariousness and eventual collapse. A company and its partners set up an SPV for some specific purpose(s) and supply the equity capital. The parent company may have operating control, but because it doesn’t have majority ownership, it doesn’t consolidate the SPV on its financial statements. The SPV takes on debt, but that debt doesn’t appear on the parent’s books. The parent may be an investment grade borrower, but likewise, the debt isn’t an obligation of the parent or guaranteed by it. Today’s debt may be backed by promised rent from a data center tenant – sometimes an equity partner – but the debt isn’t a direct obligation of the equity partner either. Essentially, an SPV is a way to make it look like a company isn’t doing the things the SPV is doing and doesn’t have the debt the SPV does. (Private equity funds and private credit funds are highly likely to be found among the partners and lenders in these entities.) As I quoted earlier, according to Perez (who wrote on the heels of the dot-com bubble), “what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments.” Early investment is lost in the “Minsky moment,” in which unwise commitments made in an extended up-cycle encounters value destruction in a correction. And there are three things we know for sure about the use of debt: it magnifies losses if there are losses (just as it magnifies the hoped-for gains if they materialize), it increases the probability of a venture failing if it encounters a difficult moment, and despite the layer of equity beneath it, it puts lenders’ capital at risk if the difficult moment is bad enough. One key risk to consider is the possibility that the boom in data center construction will result in a glut. Some data centers may be rendered uneconomic, and some owners may go bankrupt. In that case, a new generation of owners might buy up centers at pennies on the dollar from lenders who foreclosed on them, reaping profits when the industry stabilizes. This is a process through which “creative destruction” brings markets into equilibrium and reduces costs to levels that make future business profitable. Debt is neither a good thing nor a bad thing per se. Likewise, the use of leverage in the AI industry shouldn’t be applauded or feared. It all comes down to the proportion of debt in the capital structure; the quality of the assets or cash flows you’re lending against; the borrowers’ alternative sources of liquidity for repayment; and the adequacy of the safety margin obtained by lenders. We’ll see which lenders maintain discipline in today’s heady environment. It’s worth noting in this connection that Oaktree has made a few investments in data centers, and our parent, Brookfield, is raising a $10 billion fund for investment in AI infrastructure. Brookfield is putting up its own money and has equity commitments from sovereign wealth funds and Nvidia, to which it intends to apply “prudent” debt. Brookfield’s investments seem likely to go largely into geographies that are less saturated with data centers and for infrastructure to supply the vast amounts of electric power that data centers will require. Of course, we’re both doing these things on the basis of what we think are prudent decisions. I know I don’t know enough to opine on AI. But I do know something about debt, and it’s this: It’s okay to supply debt financing for a venture where the outcome is uncertain. It’s not okay where the outcome is purely a matter of conjecture. Those who understand the difference still have to make the distinction correctly. The FT’s Unhedged quotes Chong Sin, lead analyst for CMBS research at JPMorgan, as saying, “. . . in our conversations with investment grade ABS and CMBS investors, one often-cited concern is whether they want to take on the residual value risk of data centers when the bonds mature.” I’m glad potential lenders are asking the kind of questions they should. Here’s how to think about the intersection of debt and AI according to Bob O’Leary, Oaktree’s co-CEO and co-portfolio manager of our Opportunities Funds: Most technological advances develop into winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most competitions. The “right” way to play this dynamic is through equity, not debt. Assuming you can diversify your equity exposures so as to include the eventual winner, the massive gain from the winner will more than compensate for the capital impairment on the losers. That’s the venture capitalist’s time-honored formula for success. The precise opposite is true of a diversified pool of debt exposures. You’ll only make your coupon on the winner, and that will be grossly insufficient to compensate for the impairments you’ll experience on the debt of the losers. Of course, if you can’t identify the pool of companies from which the winner will emerge, the difference between debt and equity is irrelevant – you’re a zero either way. I mention this because that’s precisely what happened in search and social media: early leaders (Lycos in search and MySpace in social media) lost out spectacularly to companies that emerged later (Google in search and Facebook in social media). Trying to Get to a Conclusion There can be no doubt that today’s behavior is “speculative,” defined as based on speculation regarding the future. There’s also no doubt that no one knows what the future holds, but investors are betting huge sums on that future. In that connection, I want to say a little about the unique nature of AI. The AI revolution is different from the technological revolutions that preceded it in ways that are both wonderful and worrisome. It feels to me like a genie has been released from a bottle, and it isn’t going back in: AI may not be a tool for mankind, but rather something of a replacement. It may be capable of taking over cognition, on which humans have thus far had a monopoly. Because of this, it’s likely to be different in kind from prior developments, not just in degree. (More on this in my postscript.) AI technology is progressing at an incredibly rapid clip, possibly leaving scant time for mankind to adjust. I’ll provide two examples: Coding, which we called “computer programming” 60 years ago, is the canary in the coal mine in terms of the impact of AI. In many advanced software teams, developers no longer write the code; they type in what they want, and AI systems generate the code for them. Coding performed by AI is at a world-class level, something that wasn’t so just a year ago. According to my guide here, “There is no speculation about whether or not human replacement will take place in that vertical.” In the field of digital advertising, when users log into an app, AI engages in “ad matching,” showing them ads tailored to the preferences displayed by their prior surfing. No humans need apply to do this job. Perhaps most importantly, the growth of demand for AI seems totally unpredictable. As one of my younger advisers explained, “the speed and scale of improvement mean it’s incredibly hard to forecast demand for AI. Adoption today may have nothing to do with adoption tomorrow, because a year or two from now, AI may be able to do 10x or 100x what it can do today. Thus, how can anyone say how many data centers will be needed? And how can even successful companies know how much computing capacity to contract for?” With differences like these, how can anyone correctly judge what AI implies for the future? * * * One of the things occupying many observers at this juncture – including me – is the search for parallels to past bubbles. Here’s some historical perspective from a recent article in Wired: AI’s closest historical analogue here may be not electric lighting but radio. When RCA started broadcasting in 1919, it was immediately clear that it had a powerful information technology on its hands. But less clear was how that would translate into business. “Would radio be a loss-leading marketing for department stores? A public service for broadcasting Sunday sermons? An ad-supported medium for entertainment?” [Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch of the University of Maryland] write. “All were possible. All were subjects of technological narratives.” As a result, radio turned into one of the biggest bubbles in history – peaking in 1929, before losing 97 percent of its value in the crash. This wasn’t an incidental sector; RCA was, along with Ford Motor Company, the most high-traded stock on the market. It was, as The New Yorker recently wrote, “the Nvidia of its day.” . . . In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. . . . It was the biggest tech demo of the day, and it became an enormous, ChatGPT-launch-level coordinating event – a signal to investors to pour money into the industry. “Expert investors appreciated correctly the importance of airplanes and air travel,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write, but “the narrative of inevitability largely drowned out their caution. Technological uncertainty was framed as opportunity, not risk. The market overestimated how quickly the industry would achieve technological viability and profitability.” As a result, the bubble burst in 1929 – from its peak in May, aviation stocks dropped 96 percent by May 1932. . . . It’s worth reiterating that two of the closest analogs AI seems to have in tech bubble history are aviation and broadcast radio. Both were wrapped in high degrees of uncertainty and both were hyped with incredibly powerful coordinating narratives. Both were seized on by pure play companies seeking to capitalize on the new game-changing tech, and both were accessible to the retail investors of the day. Both helped inflate a bubble so big that when it burst, in 1929, it left us with the Great Depression. (“AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All,” Brian Merchant, Wired, October 27 – emphasis added. N.b., the Depression had many causes beyond the bursting of the radio/aviation bubble.) Derek Thompson, who supplied the quote with which I opened this memo, ended his newsletter with some terrific historical perspective: The railroads were a bubble and they transformed America. Electricity was a bubble, and it transformed America. The broadband build-out of the late-1990s was a bubble that transformed America. I am not rooting for a bubble, and quite the contrary, I hope that the US economy doesn’t experience another recession for many years. But given the amount of debt now flowing into AI data center construction, I think it’s unlikely that AI will be the first transformative technology that isn’t overbuilt and doesn’t incur a brief painful correction. (“AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself.” November 4 – emphasis added) The skeptics readily cite ways in which today’s events are comparable to the internet bubble: A change-the-world technology Exuberant, speculative behavior The role of FOMO Suspect, circular deals The use of SPVs $1 billion seed rounds The supporters have reasons why the comparison isn’t appropriate: An existing product for which there is strong demand One billion users already (many times the number of internet users at the height of the bubble) Well-established main players with revenues, profits, and cash flow The absence of an IPO craze with prices doubling in a day Reasonable p/e ratios for the established participants I’ll elaborate regarding the first of the proposed non-comparable factors. Unlike in the internet bubble, AI products already exist at scale, the demand for them is exploding, and they’re producing revenues in rapidly increasing amounts. For example, Anthropic, one of the two leaders in producing models for AI coding as described on page 12, is said to have “10x-ed” its revenues in each of the last two years (for those who didn’t study higher math, that’s 100x in two years). Revenues from Claude Code, a program for coding that Anthropic introduced earlier this year, already are said to be running at an annual rate of $1 billion. Revenues for the other leader, Cursor, were $1 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024, and they, too, are expected to reach $1 billion this year. As to the final bullet point, see the table below, which comes from Goldman Sachs via Derek Thompson. You’ll notice that during the internet bubble of 1998-2000, the p/e ratios were much higher for Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle than they are today for the biggest AI players – Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta (OpenAI doesn’t have earnings). In fact, Microsoft’s on a half-off sale relative to its p/e 26 years ago! In the first bubble I witnessed – surrounding the Nifty-Fifty in 1969-72 – the p/e ratios for the leading companies were even higher than those of 1998-2000. In Conclusion For my final citation, I’ll look to Sam Altman of OpenAI. His comments seem to me to capture the essence of what’s going on: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Mr. Altman told reporters this year. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about A.I.? My opinion is yes. Is A.I. the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” (The New York Times, November 20) But do I have a bottom line? Yes, I do. Alan Greenspan’s phrase, mentioned earlier, serves as an excellent way to sum up a stock market bubble: “irrational exuberance.” There is no doubt that investors are applying exuberance with regard to AI. The question is whether it’s irrational. Given the vast potential of AI but also the large number of enormous unknowns, I think virtually no one can say for sure. We can theorize about whether the current enthusiasm is excessive, but we won’t know until years from now whether it was. Bubbles are best identified in retrospect. While the parallels to past bubbles are inescapable, believers in the technology will argue that “this time it’s different.” Those four words are heard in virtually every bubble, explaining why the present situation isn’t a bubble, unlike the analogous prior ones. On the other hand, Sir John Templeton, who in 1987 drew my attention to those four words, was quick to point out that 20% of the time things really are different. But on the third hand, it must be borne in mind that behavior based on the belief that it’s different is what causes it to not be different! Today’s situation calls to mind a comment attributed to American economist Stuart Chase about faith. I believe it’s also applicable to AI (as well as to gold and cryptocurrencies): For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible. Here’s my actual bottom line: There’s a consistent history of transformational technologies generating excessive enthusiasm and investment, resulting in more infrastructure than is needed and asset prices that prove to have been too high. The excesses accelerate the adoption of the technology in a way that wouldn’t occur in their absence. The common word for these excesses is “bubbles.” AI has the potential to be one of the greatest transformational technologies of all time. As I wrote just above, AI is currently the subject of great enthusiasm. If that enthusiasm doesn’t produce a bubble conforming to the historical pattern, that will be a first. Bubbles created in this process usually end in losses for those who fuel them. The losses stem largely from the fact that the technology’s newness renders the extent and timing of its impact unpredictable. This in turn makes it easy to judge companies too positively amid all the enthusiasm and difficult to know which will emerge as winners when the dust settles. There can be no way to participate fully in the potential benefits from the new technology without being exposed to the losses that will arise if the enthusiasm and thus investors’ behavior prove to have been excessive. The use of debt in this process – which the high level of uncertainty usually precluded in past technological revolutions – has the potential to magnify all of the above this time. Since no one can say definitively whether this is a bubble, I’d advise that no one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the risk of ruin if things go badly. But by the same token, no one should stay all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps forward. A moderate position, applied with selectivity and prudence, seems like the best approach. Finally, it’s essential to bear in mind that there are no magic words in investing. These days, people promoting real estate funds say, “Office buildings are so yesterday, but we’re investing in the future through data centers,” whereupon everyone nods in agreement. But data centers can be in shortage or in oversupply, and rental rates can surprise to the upside or the downside. As a result, they can be profitable . . . or not. Intelligent investment in data centers, and thus in AI – like everything else – requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful implementation. December 9, 2025 P.S.: The following has nothing to do with the financial markets or the question of whether AI is the subject of a bubble. My topic is the impact of AI on society through joblessness and purposelessness. You needn’t read it – that’s why it’s a postscript – but it’s important to me, and I've been looking for a place to say a few words about it. On November 18, a research note from Barclays described Fed Governor Christopher Waller as having “highlighted how recent stock market enthusiasm around AI has not yet translated into job creation.” This strikes me as paradoxical given my sense that one of AI’s main impacts will be to increase productivity and thus eliminate jobs. That is the source of my concern. I view AI primarily as an incredible labor-saving device. Joe Davis, Global Chief Economist and Global Head of the Investment Strategy Group at Vanguard, says, “for most jobs – likely four out of five – AI’s impact will result in a mixture of innovation and automation, and could save about 43% of the time people currently spend on their work tasks.” (Exponential View, September 3) I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can’t find jobs because of it. The optimists argue that “new jobs have always materialized after past technological advances.” I hope that’ll hold true in the case of AI, but hope isn’t much to hang one’s hat on, and I have trouble figuring out where those jobs will come from. Of course, I’m not much of a futurist or a financial optimist, and that’s why it’s a good thing I shifted from equities to bonds in 1978. The other thing the optimists say is that “the beneficial impact of AI on productivity will cause a huge acceleration in GDP growth.” Here I have specific quibbles: The change in GDP can be thought of as the change in hours worked times the change in output per hour (aka “productivity”). The role of AI in increasing productivity means it will take fewer hours worked – meaning fewer workers – to produce the goods we need. Or, viewed from the other direction, maybe the boom in productivity will mean a lot more goods can be produced with the same amount of labor. But if a lot of jobs are lost to AI, how will people be able to afford the additional goods AI enables to be produced? I find it hard to imagine a world in which AI works shoulder-to-shoulder with all the people who are employed today. How can employment not decline? AI is likely to replace large numbers of entry-level workers, people who process paper without applying judgment, and junior lawyers who scour the lawbooks for precedents. Maybe even junior investment analysts who create spreadsheets and compile presentation materials. It’s said that AI can read an MRI better than the average doctor. Driving is one of the most populous professions in America, and driverless vehicles are already arriving; where will all the people who currently drive taxis, limos, buses, and trucks find jobs? I imagine government’s response will be something called “universal basic income.” The government will simply mail checks to the millions for whom there are no jobs. But the worrier in me finds problems in this, too: Where will the money come from for those checks? The job losses I foresee imply reduced income tax receipts and increased spending on entitlements. This puts a further burden on the declining segment of the population that is working and implies even greater deficits ahead. In this new world, will governments be able to fund ever-increasing deficits? And more importantly, people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck. A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect, and presents them with challenges, the overcoming of which provides satisfaction. How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day. I worry about the correlation between the loss of jobs in mining and manufacturing in recent decades and the incidence of opioid addiction and shortening of lifespans. And by the way, if we eliminate large numbers of junior lawyers, analysts, and doctors, where will we get the experienced veterans capable of solving serious problems requiring judgment and pattern recognition honed over decades? What jobs won’t be eliminated? What careers should our children and grandchildren prepare for? Think about the jobs that machines can’t perform. My list starts with plumbers, electricians, and masseurs –physical tasks. Maybe nurses will earn more than doctors because they deliver hands-on care. And what distinguishes the best artists, athletes, doctors, lawyers, and hopefully investors? I think it’s something called talent or insight, which AI might or might not be able to replicate. But how many people at the top of those professions are needed? A past presidential candidate said he would give laptops to everyone who lost their job to offshoring. How many laptop operators do we need? Finally, I’m concerned that a small number of highly educated multi-billionaires living on the coasts will be viewed as having created technology that puts millions out of work. This promises even more social and political division than we have now, making the world ripe for populist demagoguery. I’ve seen incredible progress over the course of my lifetime, but in many ways I miss the simpler world I grew up in. I worry that this will be another big one. I get no pleasure from this recitation. Will the optimists please explain why I’m wrong? Interestingly in this connection, Vanguard’s Joe Davis points out that more Americans are turning 65 in 2025 than in any preceding year, and that approximately 16 million baby boomers will retire between now and 2035. Could AI merely make up for that? There’s an optimistic take for you.

Title: Unity Software Turned $1,000 Into $2,105 in One Year While IPO Investors Stay Underwater

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Unity Software (NYSE: U) went public in September 2020 at $52 per share during the pandemic gaming boom. The company provides the engine behind thousands of mobile games and interactive 3D experiences. Its business splits into Create Solutions (development tools) and Grow Solutions (advertising and monetization platform). The stock peaked above $200 in late 2021 during metaverse hype, then crashed over 80% by 2024. Unity burned cash, posted widening losses, and alienated developers with a controversial runtime fee structure threatening to charge per game install. New CEO Matthew Bromberg canceled the unpopular fees in early 2024, raised subscription prices, and pivoted into AI-powered advertising with Unity Vector. The stock bottomed around $15 in early 2024 and has since tripled. Here’s what $1,000 invested at different points would be worth today at $49.47 per share: 1-Year Return (December 2024 to December 2025) Since IPO (September 2020 to December 2025) IPO investors remain underwater after five years. But 2024 buyers doubled their money in 12 months, crushing the S&P 500 by 100 percentage points. Unity’s Q3 2025 earnings on November 5 delivered a massive surprise. The company posted adjusted earnings of $0.20 per share against expectations of a $0.24 loss. Revenue of $471 million beat estimates, and management credited Unity Vector AI for driving 6% growth in the advertising segment. Free cash flow hit $151 million. Analysts expect $0.89 in earnings for fiscal 2025, turning the corner to profitability. Wedbush added Unity to its Best Ideas List in early December, citing undervaluation in the game engine and mobile ad markets. Simply Wall St estimated fair value at $55.77, suggesting 20% upside at current prices near $49. Unity’s profile includes high growth potential through AI-powered advertising, 74% gross margins, and a path to profitability. The company dominates mobile game development, Vector AI is working, and the stock trades at 11.7 times sales with a forward P/E of 105. However, Unity still posted a $127 million GAAP loss in Q3 despite adjusted profits. The stock has a beta above 2, meaning higher volatility than the market. Insider selling has been heavy, with directors unloading millions in shares. Competition from Epic’s Unreal Engine remains fierce, and geopolitical risk exists with significant operations in Israel. The turnaround appears real, the AI monetization story has legs, and the valuation isn’t insane relative to peers like Roblox (15.6 times sales, still unprofitable). The stock’s high volatility requires careful position sizing. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

GE Vernova (GEV) shares surged to a record high Wednesday after the company boosted its financial targets and doubled its quarterly dividend. The stock was up over 13% near $707 in recent trading, leaving it on track to close at an all-time high. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) The energy equipment manufacturer said during its investor day Tuesday that its 2025 sales are trending toward the higher end of its $36 billion to $37 billion forecast, and lifted its projections for free cash flow this year to $3.5 billion to $4 billion, up from $3 billion to $3.5 billion previously. The company said it expects to generate $41 billion to $42 billion in revenue next year, along with $4.5 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow, and hiked its long-term projections for revenue and free cash flow by 2028. GE Vernova's board also approved doubling its dividend to $0.50 per share and boosted its stock buyback plan to $10 billion from $6 billion previously. GE Vernova's stronger outlook could boost confidence in its business as an independent entity after the provider of energy equipment and former division of General Electric was spun off from the conglomerate last year. UBS analysts said the higher targets constituted a "very strong update," and that GE Vernova could be poised to beat its own forecasts given a "track record of overdelivering." William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients that they continue to see GE Vernova as "the leader in energy and power infrastructure, in our view the most important component to the AI theme." Oppenheimer analysts upgraded their rating of GE Vernova stock to "outperform" with a $855 price target, writing "the magnitude of the AI infrastructure buildout proving larger and lasting longer than we previously anticipated." With Wednesday's gains, GE Vernova stock has more than doubled in value in 2025.

Title: What does the Netflix deal mean for Warner Bros's games division?

Industry experts on the future for studios like Avalanche, Netherrealm, and Rocksteady After a brutal 12 months marked by financial underperformance, studio closures, and reorganisation, a fresh shadow has fallen over Warner Bros. Games: the prospect of a new corporate owner. The division is included – as an afterthought – in the sale of Warner Bros. Discovery to Netflix, which was subsequently challenged by a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance. Both potential buyers are wooing shareholders, and whoever wins will require regulatory approval, so closure on the deal is months or years away. Whatever the outcome, there is widespread concern about the impact on Warner's games teams. The firm is the only major Hollywood mega-studio to have maintained a strong position in gaming. It owns a series of successful mobile games as well as the AAA studios Netherrealm, Avalanche, Rocksteady, and TT Games alongside support studios in the US and Canada. Warner's hits have included TT's Lego games, Rocksteady's Batman Arkham series, and the runaway success of Avalanche's Hogwarts Legacy, which has sold over 30 million units. Netflix, meanwhile, has yet to make a significant impact in games, despite years of trying. After a splashy but ultimately fruitless investment in AAA, and deciding against bidding for EA (as reported by Bloomberg), the company has refocused on casual, second-screen games, supported by licensing titles like GTA. Games head Alain Tascan, an industry veteran with long stints at Epic and Ubisoft, has committed to titles that "use the phone as a controller," with a focus on multiplayer, kids, narrative, and mass appeal, as well as an eye on the social layer that Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft deliver. The company has cancelled unannounced publishing deals with external studios, sources have told GamesIndustry.biz. In public, it shut down the developer of its successful Squid Game mobile title and sold internal team Spry Fox back to its founders. The company is also planning to borrow $59 billion to pay for Warner, one of the largest such loans yet granted, and will be looking at asset sales to bring that figure down post-completion. On the face of it, the prospects for Warner's game division under Paramount look brighter. Newly added subsidiary Skydance has published a series of VR titles under the leadership of David Ellison, who now leads Paramount Skydance, and the company has a long history of licensing its IP for games, from Nickelodeon through to South Park and Star Trek. And it says it wants to do more. "During the merger with Skydance, Paramount identified games as a potential area of development and growth for the company," points out Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis. "David Ellison has greenlit, maintained and shipped Triple A scale multiple games at Skydance," says Symbol Zero's Rafael Brown. "Netflix hasn't greenlit and maintained, and shipped, a game budget of more than $5 million for any project thus far. The closest would have been Team Blue's Triple A game, which was cancelled. Netflix has zero history in funding and supporting Triple A games successfully." The optimistic view is that Netflix will reconsider this approach post-acquisition. Blue Moons' Richard Browne, who served as VP of Universal's game group before executive roles at THQ and Digital Extremes, is bullish. "I don't think they cease publishing AAA games," he says. "With Warner Bros. recently restructuring to support the core business, much as we did at Universal back in the early 2000s, it's now better positioned to deliver transmedia in a more coherent way. Assuming the division delivers positive growth and profit, there would be very little reason for Netflix to integrate it into an incompatible service or shutter it. You have a AAA industry veteran running Netflix Games, Alain Tascan will be able to harness and direct it accordingly." "Assuming the division delivers positive growth and profit, there would be very little reason for Netflix to integrate it into an incompatible service or shutter it. You have a AAA industry veteran running Netflix Games." "WB Games is a collection of some of the top game studios in the world," says Cassia Curran of the Curran Games Agency, "and they specialise in taking existing IP and translating them into fantastic, high quality games. Netflix could pump up the value of their premium subscription tier by allowing access to these games, and greatly deepen fan engagement and the value of the IP they own outright, such as KPop Demon Hunters, with top-tier AAA games made by the studios at WB Games." "This is a big opportunity for Netflix to recalibrate and double down on games," agrees Hendrik Lesser, president of the European Games Developer Federation. "The mix of great studios, great IP and Netflix's reach is one of a kind." Others go further. Far from being an afterthought, game studios should be a key plank in Netflix's ongoing growth, argues Lirui Ding of the games venture capital firm Transcend Fund. "What they're acquiring isn't just IP, but a studio system that's already proven it can translate world-class franchises into hit games," he says. "That matters because in gaming and entertainment more broadly, content is where durable value accrues. We have definitely seen this in the Transcend portfolio. Technology, tools, and platforms evolve, but gaming hits extend IP lifecycles, deepen engagement, and compound value across media. If handled correctly, games can reinforce the entire franchise ecosystem." The pessimistic view is that this heralds another round of industry downsizing from a company that has bought a business it doesn't need. "I believe Netflix will initially leave studios alone for the first six to 12 months and then start making cuts," says Brown, "and then gradually dismantle all of WB Games due to not wanting the financial outlay of AAA games that they did not purchase WB for." Many see Paramount as a less disruptive prospect. "Skydance is likely to value these game studios much more highly," says Curran. "It's had significant success with VR games like The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and WB Games studios make similar games to their Amy Hennig-led Skydance New Media team, which is releasing Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra next year, so they would fold in with each other easily. A Skydance acquisition would probably end up being business as usual for the WB Games studios." Harding-Rolls agrees. "I think the WB Games status quo is more likely to come from a Paramount acquisition rather than Netflix," he says. "I would expect Netflix to make more changes including potentially scaling down the number of studios." Any such divestment would require willing buyers, which have been thin on the ground in recent years. "Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Embracer, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Tencent, Netease, Krafton, and Nexon are all not in the space for buying right now," says Brown. "The game industry is retrenching and everyone is shedding studios and projects." Others are more optimistic. "I think there would be some buyers for select studios," says Harding-Rolls, "but the deal appetite for AAA studios remains quite soft due to the investment needed and the risks involved. The obvious candidates would be Savvy Games, EA (via the Saudi Public Investment Fund), and the console companies." Investors see value, too. "I think you'd actually find a healthy buyer universe for WB's marquee assets such as NetherRealm and Avalanche Software," says Joe Yuan, Investment Director at Hiro Capital. "The Korean strategics including Krafton, Nexon, and Smilegate are quite active in today's market, and private equity has emerged as a new buyer category and are looking for established, scaled assets that they can use as an anchor to pull in other acquisitions." Yuan can also see an outcome where the studios could go solo. "We are seeing more and more management buyouts emerge, so I think that may be a viable path for some of these teams to control their destiny a bit more and have more financial upside," he says. Arc Games, Saber Interactive, and Toys for Bob have found the support to break away, and it's possible WB studios could too, although investors would need deep pockets. The prospects are brightest for Avalanche, with the record-breaking success of Hogwarts Legacy behind it, and Netherrealm, buoyed by the consistent performance of Mortal Kombat. Rocksteady, weighed down by the expensive underperformance of Suicide Squad, has a much gloomier outlook. Nevertheless, "studios with the proven ability to profitably ship AAA titles are valuable assets," says Transcend's Ding. "Strategic buyers, major publishers, platform holders, and private equity seeking revenue quality would all likely take a look in a strategic carve-out scenario." A notable new buyer in the event of Netflix prevailing might be… Paramount. Picking up WB's gaming studios could soften the blow of missing out on the film studio assets – although integrating them would be a significant undertaking and would inevitably involve layoffs. "I expect there to be some streamlining whichever company ends up acquiring," says Harding-Rolls. "Netflix is a train wreck for games and interactivity. They have been consistently for a decade now. This is not by choice but because everything is geared towards video subscription retention." Brown's outlook remains the bleakest. "Netflix is a train wreck for games and interactivity," he says. "They have been consistently for a decade now. This is not by choice but because everything is geared towards video subscription retention." "Paramount is hungry to grow a games division, but they can do that without Warner Bros. Meanwhile, Netflix wants video content but not video games. The game and movie industries are both healthier if neither Paramount nor Netflix buys Warner Bros Digital." Lirui Ding and Shanti Bergel at Transcend Fund see a brighter future, in line with the rise of transmedia success stories, from Fortnite to the Sonic movie series, that bridge games and other forms of entertainment. "The biggest opportunity is to demonstrate that games are a first-class content pillar, not a side initiative. If Netflix leans into this third chapter and lets the studios operate with the autonomy required to succeed, it could meaningfully redefine cross-media franchise building. If not, others will capture that value by acquiring the talent and capabilities that emerge. Either way, the long-term winners will be those who understand that content – not tooling or distribution alone – commands the highest value."

Toni Meadows: “Equity markets have been dominated by an AI gold rush in 2025 and this leaves valuations looking expensive by historical comparison. After years of US dominance, the equity market leadership in global indices is highly concentrated both in terms of regional split and the top 10 stocks within the US market. In historical terms, this usually leads to a major rotation or reversal at some point, but the question remains ‘is it different this time due to the unprecedented scope of the technological revolution, driven by data, bandwidth and computing power?’ Thus far, US earnings have surprised on the upside and investors have cheered every AI related deal. Even second derivative trades have done well, as investors seek exposure to companies that are positioned to benefit from the massive AI infrastructure build-out currently underway. “In support of this market environment, economic growth has been sufficient, if not spectacular, and government policy has been supportive. Interest rates have been cut by the western central banks, even as inflation has proven to be ‘sticky’. Given the high stock of outstanding debt and budget deficits – the size of which are usually more suited to a recession than slow growth environments, there is little room to manoeuvre with regard to fiscal policy support. In fact, the world should probably get used to periodic volatility driven by changing sentiment in the debt markets. We saw this with the market reaction to ‘Liberation Day’ in April when Trump unveiled the extent of his tariff policy. Investors are currently sanguine about the impact of tariffs on economic growth and inflation, and we would not expect that to change in 2026. However, given the combative style of the US President in negotiations of any kind, it is likely there will be policy-induced volatility in markets at some point in 2026. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more “High starting valuations both in equity and debt markets, where spreads are tight, will mean that investors face a wall of worry. On the one hand, fear of missing out will drive prices higher as investors look to the long-term horizon and the benefits of AI on corporate earnings. But in the short-term, much of the large sums of money being spent on AI and its infrastructure will not see a return that justifies the outlay. Also, the interconnected nature of the relationships and spending between the large US tech names increases the potential impact of any disappointments along the way. So, we expect there to be periods of volatility in 2026, and beyond, as investors grapple with the seemingly late cycle characteristics of global markets, framed within the transformational potential of Artificial Intelligence. “One key area to monitor next year will be employment. Thus far, employment conditions have remained tight with headline unemployment rates low, but there are signs developing that a softening is occurring. It probably does not seem like a buoyant employment environment for some key segments of the economy, such as entry level job seekers and recent graduates. The issue with this is that many of those students are the intellectual property (ideas) generators of the future so if they struggle to get on to the employment ladder there could be a significant longer-term impact on the productive capacity of economies. This could ultimately negate some of the ‘benefit’ of AI, especially as companies embracing technology still rely on human earned capital. There could come a period, next year or beyond, where lack of employment opportunities impact consumption patterns and economic growth prospects. If investors have, at that point, exuberantly embraced a tech-based investment cycle by rewarding the share prices of a small number of companies then there could be a correction. “The key for governments and monetary authorities is to help investors to navigate the risks in a balanced manner, though history shows this is easier said than done.” TM: “Stay invested for the long-term outcome but look into methods of protecting gains in portfolios should there be volatility. Also try to find areas where it is possible to harvest returns without taking undue risk. Hybrid bonds might be an area to look into as the issuing companies are investment grade, but the characteristics of the bonds mean that a higher yield is available, and the companies are incentivized to issue them as they have a beneficial impact on their cost of capital.” Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. TM: “Wealth management will, like all major service industries, have to rise to the challenge of using technology to the benefit of clients. This will take the form of improved efficiency in workflows such as report production, documentation and communication. The key will be integrating technology into a human-led relationship with clients, that through its efficiency and speed of delivery, leads to clear decision-making – enhancing the client’s goals whilst maintaining a trusted relationship with the client.”

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Beanie Babies (CC BY 2.0) by Dominique Godbout GameStop (NYSE:GME) is the O.G. of meme stocks, the company that sparked the retail trading frenzy in 2021 and turned it into a Wall Street punchline. But those glory days are ancient history. The once-dominant video game retailer just dropped its third-quarter earnings. While showing strong year-over-year profit growth, the core business is crumbling under the weight of digital downloads and subscription services. Its lone bright spot was once again collectibles, now 31% of revenue — up from 20% last year — and the only segment indicating growth. GameStop has flopped at pivoting to digital gaming, with software sales tanking 27%. It even hopped on the crypto treasury trend, stacking Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) on its balance sheet, but the crypto winter crushed that bet, leaving holdings underwater. Right now, collectibles are its sole lifeline, but is that enough to bet on this fading giant? GameStop’s latest report paints a mixed picture: impressive bottom-line gains masking top-line woes. While net income more than quadrupled to $77.1 million and operating income flipped to a $41.3 million profit from a $33.4 million loss, revenue declined 4.6%. Hardware and accessories, the biggest segment at 45% of sales, dropped 12% to $367.4 million as physical consoles lose ground. Software plunged even harder, down 27% to $197.5 million, hammered by the digital shift. Collectibles, now the second-largest reportable segment at $256.1 million, rose 50% year-over-year, fueled by demand for Funko Pops and trading cards. Gross profit climbed to $273.4 million on tighter inventory and lower markdowns while cash swelled to $8.8 billion, bolstered by prior equity raises. But investors weren’t impressed, and the stock is dipping 6% in pre-market trading this morning, signaling doubts about sustainability. This isn’t much of a turnaround; it looks more like damage control. Collectibles have become GameStop’s crutch, but don’t mistake it for a growth engine. Sure, it’s profitable, as higher margins on toys and memorabilia helped lift overall gross profit. Yet, the market for physical collectibles is niche and stagnant, tied to nostalgia rather than explosive expansion. With gaming going digital, foot traffic in GameStop’s 3,000 stores is evaporating, limiting collectibles’ upside. At 31% of revenue, it’s a bigger slice of a shrinking pie, not a path to restoring the company’s meme-era highs. That’s precisely why GameStop latched onto crypto — a desperate swing for relevance in a blockchain-obsessed world. GameStop’s foray into crypto treasury mimics plays by firms like Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), but with less firepower. Starting in March, it began hoarding Bitcoin as a hedge against its dying retail model, viewing it as “digital gold” for balance sheet diversification. The retailer’s holdings stood at 4,710 bitcoin at the end of the quarter, the same amount purchased in Q2 (it didn’t buy — or sell — any in Q3). Valued at $519.4 million, they represent a $19.4 million cumulative unrealized gain, but for the current quarter it booked a $9.2 million unrealized loss. The crypto winter — sparked by macroeconomic concerns that triggered an October “flash crash” — wiped out larger gains. Unlike Strategy’s aggressive debt-fueled buys, GameStop’s approach feels half-hearted, more Hail Mary than strategy. The approach is better than taking on massive debt, but is also a reminder that crypto treasuries amplify risks for legacy firms like this one. GameStop has essentially surrendered on reviving its core video game retail business, with its digital pivot tattered and physical sales tumbling. All hope is now pinned on a Bitcoin bull run to juice its $519 million stash and spark a valuation rebound. The video game retailer is walking a high-wire act. It isn’t Strategy or even Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMEX:BMNR), which is pursuing a similar course, but with Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). They have focused crypto mandates and deeper expertise, while GameStop has collectibles. Toys might offer steady cash flow, but they’re no growth rocket. Investors thinking of buying in or holding on must confront the reality: Do you really want exposure to a collectibles retailer moonlighting as a bitcoin holder? It’s speculative at best, a meme relic at worst. Best to avoid it altogether and invest in companies with real potential. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

When Cindy Rose took the helm at the advertising agency giant WPP in September, she inherited one of the most challenging jobs on Madison Avenue. Battered by a period of big account losses, internal restructuring, and thousands of layoffs, morale had sunk. So had the share price. London-based WPP was trading at lows not seen since 2009, and the company had warned investors that the remainder of the year would continue to be rocky. Insiders and shareholders were hopeful that Rose, a US-born executive most recently at Microsoft, could serve as a kind of Goldilocks porridge compared to her predecessors. She was widely seen as a happy medium between Martin Sorrell, the outspoken British business mogul who had built WPP from the ground up over 33 years, and Mark Read, the more introverted operator who took over in 2018. Rose was described by one analyst as a "peacemaker," and her tech background and experience in maintaining client relationships were viewed as positive attributes that would help bring about much-needed change. This week, Rose marked her 100th day in the role. Darren Woolley, CEO of the management consultancy Trinity P3, scored Rose a "7.8 out of 10" for her performance so far. "She's saying all the right things and has sent some signals to the market. The big test will be what happens early next year, as she sets out her strategy," Woolley said. "Cindy will not last a year if they don't believe the strategy can be delivered." Rose's wins during her first 100 days — some major new business, key hires, a big partnership with Google, and an oversubscribed bond sale — have been dampened by bad news. On her first earnings call, in October, Rose described the company's performance as "unacceptable." Shortly after delivering its second profit warning of the year and downgrading its full-year growth forecast, its shares spiraled further downward, and WPP was demoted from the FTSE 100 index of the UK's largest publicly listed companies. Shares of the London-listed company have dropped by about 18% since Rose became chief executive. Adding to Rose's overflowing in-tray, WPP was hit with a lawsuit from one of its former executives who said he was fired in July of this year — before Rose's arrival as CEO — after he raised concerns internally that the group's media investment division was allegedly running a kickback scheme. WPP said in November it would "vigorously" defend itself against the allegations made in the suit. The case is ongoing. WPP has fallen behind the sector's star performer, Publicis Groupe, and it faces a new titan following the combo of Omnicom and IPG this year. Agencyland also faces a bigger, existential quandary: What is the role of a large advertising agency holding company amid the rise of tech and the emergence of AI solutions that claim to automate much of the work agencies charge top dollar for? This account of Rose's tenure so far draws on interviews with more than a dozen current and former WPP staffers and clients, competitors, marketing consultants, and industry analysts. They said Rose deserves credit for delivering a positive narrative about WPP's opportunities while also owning its problems. Much of her fate will rest on a strategy plan that she has said she will outline fully next year. Insiders and analysts said her strategy will need to be bold and visionary, given the challenges ahead. Rose told Business Insider in a statement that in her first 100 days, she has actively sought feedback from WPP's top clients to help create a blueprint for what the company needs to do differently in the future. "I'm most proud of our WPP employees for their incredible resilience, client obsession, and passion to win, which is already making a difference, and you can see it in the business that we're winning: Mastercard, Reckitt, Henkel, and more to come," Rose said. This past September, from the company's 3 World Trade Center campus in New York City, Rose laid out a three-pronged blueprint for what she called "a new WPP" at her first global town hall as CEO. Her first priority was "putting people first" by creating an environment for employees to thrive. She said WPP should be famous for "being completely client-obsessed" as part of her "winning for clients" principle. And she said WPP should be "harnessing our AI advantage," telling staffers to become "AI superusers." Her opening address to employees was received well internally, insiders said. "We were pleasantly surprised," one current senior WPP agency staffer said. They added that Rose is "so much better at the human stuff" than her predecessors and said she had kept the company regularly updated with videos talking up the agency's wins. WPP has been heavily pitching WPP Open, an internal AI-powered platform that integrates with technology from companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Salesforce. It connects signals from clients' own first-party data, partners, and WPP's data on the performance of thousands of campaigns to help plan and place ads, and measure the results. In October, with Rose firmly in situ, WPP announced WPP Open Pro, a self-service version to give clients their own access to the platform. The aim was to grow WPP's client base by appealing to smaller advertisers or direct-to-consumer companies that tend to handle much of their marketing in-house. WPP told staffers internally that more than 400 brands had proactively contacted the company about Open Pro in the three weeks after it launched. Douglas Hayward and Gerry Murray, analysts at the research company IDC, described the Open Pro launch in a report as "a smart move that shows that WPP is prepared to be bold and innovative and even to cannibalize its revenue in the short term." However, some analysts questioned whether WPP would be able to invest enough in marketing Open Pro to appeal to this sort of audience, which is accustomed to using tools provided by tech giants like Meta and Google. Nearly all of WPP's rivals are also leaning heavily into their tech investments and offerings as part of their pitches to clients and investors. One former WPP agency executive, who left last year, said they felt Rose should be more proactive in emphasizing the company's creative prowess as something that sets it apart from other agency holding groups and the broader tech sector. "Creativity is the only thing that human beings have got to make a difference," the exec said. Agency relationships with tech platforms are an important part of the mix as they try to differentiate themselves from competitors. This fall, in Mountain View, Rose signed a key deal with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, which sent a signal out to the market, clients, and its rivals about the strength of WPP's relationship with Google. The "expanded five-year partnership" was billed as going far beyond typical agency-Google setups. WPP said it would commit to spending $400 million on Google's tech as part of the partnership, which will give it "preferred" access to Google's latest AI models and data. Google is also one of WPP's biggest clients. Save for her welcome address to staffers, which was posted on YouTube, and her first earnings call, Rose has kept a fairly low public profile. In November, she appeared at an AI conference in New York City, hosted by Microsoft and Luma Partners, an investment bank. Attendees — who included roughly 100 high-profile tech, advertising, and media executives — said she was whisked away by her handlers into the green room before her talk, a session with Google Americas President Sean Downey, and made a swift exit afterward. Three attendees said they felt Rose missed an opportunity. "Martin, in the old days, would have worked the room for one hour," one person said, referring to Sorrell, the former WPP CEO. At the moment, WPP is a company that "needs more visible leadership for the market, for the staff, for the shareholders, for the clients," Trinity P3's Woolley said. Rose enters an advertising agency landscape that has fundamentally changed. For years, WPP was the top dog. WPP under Sorrell built a formidable empire, acquiring creative agencies and PR shops around the world, and building GroupM (now known as WPP Media) into a huge force, responsible for planning and buying billions of dollars in media across TV, print, out-of-home, and digital. The market dynamics shifted, largely due to the emergence of tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, which offer self-service tools that let advertisers bypass agencies. AI has only sped up the disruption. In recent years, clients have pressured agencies to produce more work at lower costs. Agencies have had to respond by retooling to offer marketers more services than just producing and placing ads. Rival ad firm Publicis recognized these shifts early. It made first-party data and technology services its citadels and simplified its pitch around a "power of one" operating strategy. In 2024, the French company became the biggest holding company by revenue, and over the past 18 months has won a string of clients — including many from WPP. Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun is described by many in the industry as a charismatic and omnipresent force of nature with clients, and a fierce competitor to Rose as she seeks to retain major accounts and acquire new ones. During the pitch process this year for Mars' $1.7 billion media business — before Rose was in-post as WPP CEO — the confectionery giant summoned all the agencies involved to meet on a cold January morning at the M&M's Store in central London. Sadoun turned up about an hour earlier than the scheduled time. The Mars clients hadn't arrived yet, and the doors to the store were locked shut. He waited outside on Leicester Square. Once Mars' marketing team arrived, Sadoun greeted them, and they duly invited him in for coffee — much to the chagrin of the competing agencies, who weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity to get extra face time with the clients. Mars this summer moved its media account from WPP to Publicis. "There are two types of people in life: The ones who are five minutes early and the ones who are five minutes late. It's a personal choice, and Arthur has decided to use these rules for unfair advantage by arriving 10 minutes early," said Richard Robinson, executive director of Ingenuity+, an agency search consultancy that wasn't involved in the Mars pitch. Three marketing consultants involved in client pitches said Rose is also visible and warm with clients, delivering passionate addresses and asking personal questions. They say Sadoun takes it to the next level. Focus now turns to 2026 after WPP's annus horribilis. WPP has appointed the management consulting firm McKinsey to assist Rose in conducting a strategic review of the business. Rose said in October that she would detail the outcome in the new year. Insiders and analysts predict further layoffs amid a shrinking agency landscape. Jay Pattisall, principal analyst and VP at the research company, forecasts a 15% reduction in agency jobs across the industry as automation and AI force agencies to "pivot from selling services to selling solutions." The open question is whether WPP can be optimized to success, or whether it will have to sell some or all of its business in order to best position itself for the future. Or could WPP even pull an Omnicom and acquire a rival? Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said WPP had multiple conversations about a potential acquisition of the US-centric media buying company Horizon over the years, but that the talks never came close to a deal. A Horizon spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on speculation. "They need to do some kind of jujitsu," a second former WPP executive said, referring to an unexpected M&A move to outmaneuver rivals. As insiders await the outcome of the review, WPP is expected to soon start feeling the impact of some recent sizable new business wins. It secured more than $1.5 billion in billings in November alone, including the consumer goods company Reckitt appointing WPP as its media agency of record and Henkel awarding WPP the media duties for its European consumer brands. WPP was further buoyed this week after its Wavemaker media agency secured a four-year contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to produce the UK government's ad campaigns — an account previously held by Omnicom. Rose has also made some key leadership appointments and formed a new executive management team that could help rally the troops and boost momentum. In one notable hire — and a poke in the eye to rival Sadoun — she persuaded Laurent Ezekiel, who was formerly WPP's CMO, to reverse a planned move to Publicis and become CEO of the WPP agency Ogilvy instead. Some investors appear optimistic that Rose can steer the company back on course. This month, investors ordered nearly €3 billion (about $3.5 billion) of WPP's 5.5-year bonds, even though the company only issued €1 billion (about $1.2 billion). The strong oversubscription suggests these institutional investors believe WPP will stay financially stable and meet its debt obligations. Rose, in her statement, said that her vision for WPP is clear and that AI would usher in a "golden age of marketing." Looking ahead to 2026, she said WPP's greatest opportunity is "to enable our clients to move boldly and confidently into the future and help them fully embrace AI innovation to reimagine growth and unleash their true potential."

Title: How Netflix’s WB Megadeal Stunned Hollywood — and Sparked a Fight From David Ellison

Who do you believe? The battle for control of Warner Bros. and HBO is coming down to an enormous bet on competing visions of the future of the entertainment industry. On Dec. 5, Netflix landed a whale of a deal that sent shock waves through the community. The streamer that has upended traditional Hollywood is planning to join the ranks of studio owners with an $87.2 billion agreement to acquire Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Netflix had managed to outflank David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which for nearly four months had been making increasingly rich offers for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including linear TV networks like CNN, TNT, HGTV and Food Network. Related Stories John Cena's Final Match: Here's How to Watch 'WWE Saturday Night's Main Event' Live Online Two Found Dead at Rob Reiner's Brentwood House Ellison — angered by what he felt was an unfair sales process conducted by the Warner Bros. Discovery board and chief David Zaslav — played his next chess move on Dec. 8: Paramount announced a hostile takeover bid of $30 a share for WBD, a proposed pact with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. “We’re taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve transparency and the ability to make an informed decision,” Ellison told investors and analysts on a call, noting that WBD had not responded in any way to his company’s latest offer. “Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension.” Popular on Variety Sarandos, at least publicly, was unruffled. “Today’s move was entirely expected,” he said at a UBS investor conference hours after Paramount made its move. “We have a deal done. We’re super confident we’re going to get it across the line and finish.” The trenches have been dug, and it will likely be weeks or months before it becomes clear what will happen to Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD said its board will review Paramount’s competing proposal (as required by law) and will issue a recommendation in 10 business days, by Dec. 19. But for the time being, Warner Bros. Discovery is still officially supporting the Netflix deal. The duel between Netflix and Paramount (and who knows if others will emerge) is shaping up to be the most contentious M&A brawl since the early 1990s, when John Malone and Barry Diller scrapped with Sumner Redstone over the acquisition of Paramount Pictures (with Redstone’s Viacom ultimately sealing the deal for the studio). In the war for Warner Bros., against the swirling backdrop of egos, money and market power, there’s another X factor: President Donald Trump, who has exerted control over federal agencies. On Dec. 7, while making his way down the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump declared that “I’ll be involved” in the approval process for the Netflix deal. According to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. During the meeting, the Netflix co-CEO sought to reassure the president that his company would not amass anything close to monopoly power — and that other media conglomerates would still be bigger than Netflix com bined with WB and HBO Max. Sarandos is “a fantastic man,” Trump said at the Kennedy Center. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.” He added, “It could be a problem.” Meanwhile, Trump is friendly with Ellison and his billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump has boasted, and the president publicly praised David Ellison, saying, “He’ll do a great job” as CEO of the merged Skydance Media-Paramount. The Ellisons surely have been bending his ear in trying to persuade him to oppose Netflix’s WB gambit on anti-competitive grounds. But in a surprise turn, the Ellisons faced Trump’s lash — a sign of the fickle environment in D.C. in which the megamerger will be evaluated. The president slammed Paramount over an interview that ran on the Dec. 7 episode of “60 Minutes” featuring Georgia politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump friend-turned-foe. “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP,” Trump fumed in a Truth Social post. On Monday, asked if he supported Paramount’s deal for WBD, Trump told reporters at a White House briefing, “I don’t know enough about it. I know the companies very well. I know what they are doing. But I have to see,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact market share for Netflix and Paramount Skydance. Trump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.” Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, miscalculated in the fall when he triggered the bidding war for Warner Bros. by making an unsolicited offer to buy the company. Ellison’s theory was that, fresh off Skydance Media’s completion of the Paramount Global acquisition in August, he could move fast to preempt rival bidders by offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety ahead of WBD’s planned split into two parts next year. He knew other parties — which ended up being Comcast and Netflix — would be interested in buying just WBD’s streaming and studio divisions, and Ellison believed his was the cleaner, more compelling offer. In addition to the Ellison family’s backing, Paramount’s Dec. 1 offer included $24 billion in funding from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. But Ellison’s gambit drew out other bidders. During the auction process, Netflix’s two CEOs, Sarandos and Greg Peters, played their cards closer to the vest. In public, they were noncommittal about their interest in Warner Bros., even as they were already in touch with WBD about a potential deal. Peters, at a conference in early October, downplayed the company’s desire to grow through a major acquisition. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers — they don’t have an amazing track record over time,” he said. Ellison, meanwhile, let it be known that going after Warner Bros. Discovery was all part of a master plan to scale Paramount to a global player. After chatter that Zaslav was leaning toward Netflix, Ellison and his team grew concerned they were losing the deal — and they were frustrated, as they felt they offered the higher premium and had been open about the importance of WBD to the larger strategic plan for Paramount Skydance. Paramount lawyers, in a Dec. 3 letter to Zaslav that was leaked to the press, alleged the board of Warner Bros. Discovery undertook a “myopic” bidding process “with a predetermined outcome” that favored Netflix. WBD’s lawyers responded that the board had “fully and robustly complied” with its fiduciary obligations. In a last-ditch scramble, Paramount extended its $30/share offer to WBD on Dec. 4. It was the sixth offer Paramount made to Warner Bros. over a 12-week span. “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets,” Ellison had texted Zaslav that day, according to a Paramount SEC filing revealing details of the M&A campaign. Ellison never received a reply. In the end, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted in Netflix: a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with a solid financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO. Netflix’s bid of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros.’ streaming and studios arms was deemed higher than Paramount’s final offer of $30 a share for all of WBD (inclusive of the TV networks). Shortly after 5 a.m. PT last Friday, Sarandos jumped on a conference call with Wall Street analysts to tout the monster deal Netflix — once dismissed by the Hollywood establishment as a wannabe power player — had negotiated. “I know some of you are surprised that we’re making this acquisition,” Sarandos said on the predawn call, sounding exhausted but ebullient. The blockbuster deal, Sarandos enthused, would combine Warner Bros.’ “incredible library of shows and movies” — ranging from classics like “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to modern hit franchises like Harry Potter and “Friends” — with Netflix’s “culture-defining titles,” such as “Stranger Things,” “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Squid Game.” Under the pact, Netflix also would get the Warner Bros. Games division and the legendary Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. Sarandos had been up late the night before, putting the final touches on the WB deal after several marathon days of phone and video calls, emails and text-message chains. Netflix buttoned up the agreement with WBD and Zaslav at around 7 p.m. PT on Dec. 4. Among the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. Netflix said it expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations “and build on its strengths,” including maintaining theatrical releases for WB films. Currently, Warner Bros. has deals to release its movies in cinemas through 2029. In the near term, Netflix also will keep HBO Max as a discrete service. “Nothing is changing today,” the company told its millions of customers in an email sent Friday. But anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining and eliminating redundancies. Netflix expects to see $2 billion-$3 billion in cost savings annually by the third year after the WB deal closes. Paramount said it saw upwards of $6 billion in cost synergies if it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery. And that, of course, signals looming layoffs on top of the thousands of job cuts the industry has seen in recent years. Opposition to the Netflix-WB deal assembled swiftly and fiercely across Hollywood, arising from unions, actors, directors, theater owners, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. Fueling the objections: In addition to the deal buttressing Netflix’s already formidable streaming lead with HBO Max and giving it control over the output of a major studio, Netflix has long shown an antipathy toward putting movies in theaters. Even if Netflix is derailed in its plans to swallow Warner Bros. — by Ellison’s rival bid or by regulatory agencies — the company has demonstrated a major flex. The fact that the 28-year-old streaming provider is now poised to own one of the biggest and oldest Hollywood studios cements the primacy of direct-to-consumer entertainment. Netflix, Sarandos suggested, can pull Warner Bros. and HBO into the future. “I think our more modern approach to the business model to connect people with these great stories is going to be a big win for all — every constituent involved,” he told investors. But movie theater operators are not feeling as upbeat, to put it mildly. Some theater owners are openly rooting against Netflix’s chance to vacuum up Warner Bros. The proposed deal “poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,” Michael O’Leary, CEO of trade group Cinema United, said in a statement. It will, he said, hurt theaters “from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world.” Warners has been on a roll this year. It has been No. 1 in movie market share after releasing hits like “Sinners,” “A Minecraft Movie,” “Superman” and “Weapons” in theaters. Netflix does release some movies in theaters, but on hundreds of screens (or fewer), not thousands as with a typical wide release. And Netflix mainly debuts original movies in theaters to qualify for Oscars. Sarandos didn’t exactly give a ringing endorsement of the theatrical experience — which he earlier this year dubbed “outdated” — even as he promised to honor Warner Bros.’ commitments to release upcoming films in cinemas. “I think, over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker,” he said Friday. David Ellison is trying to mine industry discontent over Netflix’s Warner Bros. play. On Monday Paramount pledged to release more than 30 films in theaters if it wins WBD — a swipe at Netflix. “Our focus is on expanding creative output, not dominating the sector, as Netflix envisions,” Ellison said. SEE ALSO: Paramount Claims WBD Is Overvaluing CNN, TBS and Other TV Networks — Alleging That Means Netflix’s Deal Is Worse for Shareholders If the Warner Bros. deal with Netflix goes through as outlined, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch. It’s not known what role he might have if Paramount’s bid prevails. But if Zaslav does exit in the wake of a sale, he’ll gain many millions of dollars from stock and options and a bonus payout, as will senior WB and HBO execs. And if Netflix is the winning party, Zaslav also will have the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the Netflix merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys. What about Warner Bros.’ rank and file? Zaslav told staffers in a town hall meeting last Friday that the pending sale to Netflix is unlikely to result in sweeping layoffs, as the streamer’s “intention is that they want to keep most people.” Sarandos asserted that Netflix is “not cutting jobs,” whereas Paramount and Comcast have been “laying people off and cutting things.” As for handling movies, Sarandos emphasized that one of Warner Bros.’ strengths is its ability to distribute movies around the world. “We didn’t buy this company to destroy that value,” Sarandos observed. There will be a lot of back and forth in the days ahead as Paramount presses its case to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Either deal would need to be approved by regulators. Netflix says it expects its deal to take 12-18 months, following WBD’s planned spinoff of its linear TV channels into Discovery Global in the third quarter. Paramount predicted it could complete a WBD takeover in 12 months. But Paramount’s challenge is likely to prolong the process for either buyer. Netflix’s WB-HBO Max deal represents a horizontal merger between rival streaming services as well as a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. “I don’t think this is a slam dunk for the companies,” says Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. That deal also would face scrutiny from European Union regulators and those in other countries, and Netflix may have to agree to restrictions or spinoffs to satisfy local regulators. Netflix execs voiced optimism that the WB acquisition will be OK’d. “[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts on Friday. Even if American regulators try to spike Netflix’s WB deal, that wouldn’t necessarily doom it. Recall that during Trump’s first term, the DOJ sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, claiming the merger constrained supply of “must-have” content, like CNN and TNT. (The lawsuit reportedly was motivated by Trump’s displeasure with CNN.) But a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies, and in February 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. A key question will be how to define the streaming marketplace. The Netflix and WBD teams suggested the enlarged company would still be competing for consumer dollars against the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu and traditional TV. Moreover, all of them are vying for watch time with internet-video powerhouses YouTube and TikTok. But this may not be a convincing argument in an antitrust review. “The agencies do not believe that everything competes with everything,” Waller says. “There is not a general market for eyeballs.” At this point, after losing the hearts and minds of WBD’s board, David Ellison seems to be placing his chips on the narrative — pitched to the Trump administration, regulatory bodies across the globe and Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders — that Netflix would run afoul of antitrust laws if it got hold of Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have approximately 200 million global subscribers, “which puts us on par with Disney,” Ellison told investors. That’s significantly below Netflix and HBO Max, which together would clock in at more than 400 million. “Our deal is completely pro-competitive. It’s pro-creative talent, pro-consumer,” Ellison said. The Warner Bros.-Netflix combination, he asserted, “would give them such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer, and is anticompetitive in every way that you can fundamentally look at it.” In the coming weeks, Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is expected to come back to WBD with another formal takeover offer — one that would top its most recent $30/share bid. Netflix, of course, paints a different picture of its agreement with WBD. “We think it’s good for consumers. We think it’s good for creators,” Sarandos told investors. “We think it’s great for the entertainment industry as a whole, because we’re creating and protecting jobs in production.” Soon, Warner Bros. Discovery board members and shareholders will have to choose between dueling bids and dueling narratives.

After a week of testimony about how Carl Rinsch spent millions of dollars on luxury mattresses, Uber Eats, Rolls-Royces, and stock and crypto trades — but not the sci-fi epic that Netflix ordered — the director got to tell his side of the story. On the witness stand Tuesday, Rinsch cast his dispute with Netflix as one big misunderstanding. In 2018, the streaming service had agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars on "White Horse," a sci-fi project that depicted a world where artificial, clone-like beings created their own society after a schism with humankind. The show had the endorsement of Keanu Reeves, who starred in Rinsch's movie "47 Ronin." By November of 2019, Rinsch had spent more than the $44 million Netflix had agreed to pay for one season of the show. With the project overbudget and unfinished, Rinsch and Netflix executives needed to determine what to do next. Would Rinsch agree to cede some creative control to Netflix, surrendering his prized "final cut" privilege? Would he reduce his ambitions and complete the single season Netflix initially ordered? Or would Netflix give him a bigger budget to deliver two seasons? In Rinsch's eyes, he was ready to deliver Netflix a mega-franchise on par with "Star Wars" or "Game of Thrones," and was negotiating the terms for a sequel. He had already spent millions of dollars of his own money on the passion project, he testified, and wanted to go bigger. "This was, in my eyes, a franchise," he testified Tuesday. "It wasn't just one movie." In March 2020, Netflix sent Rinsch's production company an additional $11 million — the money at the center of his Manhattan federal court fraud trial. According to prosecutors, Rinsch used the funds for a personal spending spree. Rinsch, on Tuesday, testified that he completed all the production work Netflix expected — at a fraction of the price. The rest, he said, was his to keep. The director ultimately never completed a single season of "White Horse." Wearing a black three-piece suit with a dark purple tie and pocket square, Rinsch faced the jury as he spoke in a quiet and forceful tone. He kept a sober expression. In a courthouse elevator during the lunch break, he looked heavenward and uttered a short prayer. The stakes are high. Rinsch — once a Hollywood rising star and protégé of Ridley Scott — has already lost his career and all of his money. If convicted on all charges, he could spend up to 90 years in prison. A keystone of the criminal trial is a March 2020 email that Bryan Noon, then a Netflix executive, sent to Rinsch and his lawyer the day before the $11 million payment. According to the email, the $11 million was meant to go toward production costs on "White Horse," which had stalled after wrapping up a shoot in Budapest the previous fall. Noon said Rinsch was required to spend the funds in a five-week period for editing the existing footage and for the costs of storyboards, production design, costume design, location booking, securing talent, and building sets for future filming. Rinsch testified Tuesday that he estimated all of that would cost only $500,000. "It's too much money," Rinsch told jurors. "I would never spend $11 million in five weeks." The other $10.5 million, Rinsch testified, was meant to reimburse him for costs he had paid out of his own pocket to continue filming "White Horse" while the production had gone over-budget. "I had a crew of probably 100 people staying in a hotel — everybody's ordering room service, everybody's exposed," Rinsch said. "So the idea was I subsidize and pay for us all to be here while we negotiate what the sequel is going to be. That was my cost — and it was a very big cost." Some jurors wore coats in the chilly courtroom on the 14th floor of the lower Manhattan courthouse, where temperatures outside dipped to 30 degrees. One juror nodded along as Rinsch said that Netflix, in his view, owed him money at the time. The director contended that he had completed principal photography on the first season of "White Horse" by the end of November 2019, when he had shot scenes in Budapest. In his understanding, Netflix executives wanted him to conduct "soft pre-production" over five weeks and show them visual concepts that would help them decide whether to order a second season — before the first season even hit the streaming service. In his testimony on Tuesday, Rinsch walked the jury through some of his spending in the weeks following the March 2020 deal that he said was for the production of "White Horse." Rinsch hired Clayton Townsend, an experienced producer who had worked on several Judd Apatow and "Fast and Furious" movies, paying his production company $30,000. He also paid over $33,000 to secure a castle in Vienna as a shooting location. He testified about the Rolls-Royces the government accused him of buying with Netflix's money. He explained that in the sci-fi world of "White Horse," he had wanted a "fleet of Rolls-Royces" carrying diplomats between the areas controlled by humans and those controlled by the "organic intelligent" beings. Rinsch said he continued working on the show throughout 2020 and early 2021, including hiring a production designer to put together concept art. Netflix didn't formally tell him it was done with "White Horse" until March 2021, Rinsch said. In a civil legal dispute with Netflix, Rinsch's side of the story didn't prevail. An arbitrator in May 2024 awarded the company $8.8 million and control over the "White Horse" footage. Rinsch was indicted by federal prosecutors nearly a year later. On cross-examination, Rinsch gave explanations that contradicted the accounts of other witnesses. And, at times, that appeared to contradict himself. During cross-examination, a prosecutor showed Rinsch transcripts of his under-oath answers from a deposition and a hearing tied to his earlier legal dispute with Netflix. While Rinsch said Tuesday that the bulk of the $11 million was for himself, he said in those earlier settings that he would use the funds for additional production work. Rinsch said he completed filming principal photography for the first season of "White Horse," and that planned shoots in Kenya and Holland were meant for a second season. Former Netflix executives testified earlier in the trial, however, that the planned shoots were for scenes that were part of the script for the first season. Under questioning on Tuesday, Rinsch didn't address testimony about him rushing to spend millions of dollars on luxury goods in 2021. Nor did Rinsch share his own account of meetings with former Netflix executive Peter Friedlander, where Friedlander testified that he flew to the set of "White Horse" in Budapest to try to resolve budget issues, but the director walked out of them without a resolution. Ahead of the trial, Rinsch's lawyers said that his "mental state" could be an issue in the case. While the trial didn't feature any testimony about Rinsch's mental health, jurors saw outlandish text messages and emails he sent to Cindy Holland, the highest-ranking Netflix executive overseeing "White Horse." In one document attached to an email, Rinsch laid out a scenario where President Donald Trump would "mobilize Chinese community and create a destabilization" of Chinese President Xi Jinping "by unifying the Chinese people to support the one thing they fear more than XJ… death." He cited this scenario among his reasons for making risky options trades in the pharmaceutical company Gilead. "I was hedging the market," Rinsch said during cross-examination. "In the instance that we had a total calamity where millions of people died, we would be able to continue working on this show." Rinsch ultimately lost millions of dollars on his Gilead trades. It was a long way from when Holland sat in Keanu Reeves' home and read the script for "White Horse," thinking it could be the next big thing. "I thought it had incredible potential," Holland testified. Jump to

Title: Will NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Hit $500 by 2030?

Time Published: 2025-12-10T15:18:03Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images It’s the darling of the financial markets and the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S.-based processor producers. Truly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is roundly revered and to many traders, NVIDIA seems unstoppable. There are plenty of price predictions for NVDA stock, and some optimists can easily envision the share price hitting $500 by 2030. Is this too far-fetched, though? The skeptics may doubt that the rally is sustainable and might see $500 as an impossible dream. Yet, as the data will reveal, NVIDIA is a chip-making powerhouse in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). So, keep an open mind as NVIDIA stock’s upside potential is considerable. Even if it is a darling of the market, NVIDIA has its doubters. One bearish-leaning commentator is hedge fund manager Michael Burry, the subject of the film The Big Short. As Rich Duprey explained here and here, Burry compared NVIDIA to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the telecommunications hardware giant that fell from grace with the dot-com bust. In the late 1990s, it felt like Cisco and its shares would continue to gain value forever. Burry apparently expects NVIDIA’s market capitalization to contract in the coming years, much as Cisco’s did after the late 1990s. His company, Scion Asset Management, has even gone so far as to take a massively bearish position against NVIDIA stock by owning put options. If Burry’s comparison between NVIDIA and Cisco holds true, then NVDA stock is unlikely to reach $500 by 2030. In hindsight, the hype surrounding Cisco outpaced the actual demand for the company’s products. So, is there a demand shortfall for NVIDIA’s AI-enabled processors? From a financial standpoint, it certainly looks like there’s enough AI chip demand to keep NVIDIA flush with cash. A quick glance at NVIDIA’s third-quarter 2025 results should drive this point home. In Q3 2025, NVIDIA generated revenue totaling $57.006 billion, versus $35.082 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That’s a 62.5% improvement, and most of the third-quarter 2025 revenue ($51.215 billion) was from NVIDIA’s Data Center segment. Thus, the demand for NVIDIA’s AI-compatible products isn’t lacking. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s net income grew 65.3% year over year, from $19.309 billion to $31.91 billion. In other words, the company is raking in a lot more capital than it’s spending. Looking ahead, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that the company’s Blackwell chip sales are “off the charts” and that its cloud GPUs are sold out. Therefore, NVIDIA in 2025 doesn’t appear to be in the same precarious position that Cisco was in 1999. The skeptics might argue that NVIDIA can’t possibly expand its sales much more than it already has. However, a recent U.S.-China trade agreement indicates that NVIDIA may have new horizons to conquer. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump is allowing NVIDIA to sell its H200 AI chips to China. Trump, according to the Journal, specified that Washington would collect 25% of NVIDIA’s sales from China. If all goes according to plan, NVIDIA stands to gain on a grand scale. The company estimated, per the Journal that it “could ship up to $5 billion in orders to China” per quarter “without geopolitical constraints.” The implications go beyond short-term revenue prospects. It’s now inarguable that the current administration values NVIDIA and seeks to protect the company’s interests. It’s unknown whether the next presidential administration will be quite as business-friendly toward NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the current administration will presumably be in place until January of 2029, and this is probably good news for NVIDIA and its shareholders. Given the pace of NVIDIA’s sales and income growth, investors should expect the company’s market cap to expand during the next five years. Unless NVIDIA actually collapses like Cisco once did, the path of least resistance for NVDA stock is to the upside. Sure, NVIDIA stock has already rallied 33% over the past year. But again, on a year-over-year basis, the company’s net sales and revenue rose 62.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Besides, those growth figures reflect a time before the President green-lit the chip sales to China. Hence, there’s still room for NVIDIA to expand its sales scope and, ultimately, its economic moat. All in all, Berry’s catastrophic AI chip market implosion scenario looks like a long shot. The financial data and the government’s apparent motivation to protect NVIDIA’s interests put the odds in the shareholders’ favor. Consequently, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory should persist through 2030 and NVDA stock’s pathway to $500 is clear, albeit not guaranteed. That’s why it’s sensible to own a few, but not too many, NVIDIA shares for the long run. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: QYLD Turns Mag 7 Tech Stocks Into an 11% Dividend Yield

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD) transforms the Nasdaq-100’s top technology stocks into an 11% monthly dividend by selling covered call options against its holdings. Unlike traditional dividend ETFs, QYLD generates income exclusively through option premiums. The fund sells near-the-money call options on its entire portfolio each month, collecting premiums from buyers who purchase the right to buy shares at specific strike prices. This strategy produces consistent monthly income but caps upside participation when tech stocks rally sharply. The fund’s $8 billion portfolio concentrates heavily in technology at 57% of the total ETF, and communication services at 17%. The top holdings – Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms – represent over half the fund and drive most option premium generation. QYLD’s 11.5% yield depends entirely on market volatility, not underlying dividends. The fund’s top holdings pay minimal natural yields: NVDA offers just 0.02%, AAPL 0.37%, and MSFT 0.70%. Amazon pays no dividend. This means QYLD’s monthly distributions fluctuate based on option premium levels, which compress during low-volatility periods. Recent dividend history reveals declining payouts. Monthly distributions averaged $0.198 in 2021 but have dropped 17% to approximately $0.169 currently. This decline reflects lower implied volatility in tech stocks as markets stabilized following pandemic-era swings. When volatility decreases, call options command lower premiums, directly reducing QYLD’s distributable income. The fund’s structure also creates total return concerns. While delivering high current income, QYLD’s net asset value has eroded 23% from its December 2021 peak of $22.82 to the current $17.54. This capital depreciation occurs because covered calls cap participation in bull market rallies. When tech stocks surge—as they did throughout 2023-2024—QYLD surrenders upside gains beyond strike prices. Investors receive steady income but miss appreciation that Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) holders capture fully. The concentration in highly valued tech stocks adds risk. NVDA trades at 46 times earnings with a beta of 2.28, creating extreme volatility that generates premiums but exposes the fund to sharp drawdowns. The April 2025 drop to $14.48 demonstrated this downside vulnerability. Income reliability remains strong—QYLD has paid monthly since 2013 without interruption. However, distribution amounts fluctuate with market conditions, and the declining trend suggests caution for investors expecting stable 11% yields indefinitely. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPI) offers a more diversified approach to option income generation. Rather than concentrating in tech-heavy Nasdaq stocks, JEPI writes calls on a broader S&P 500-based portfolio with lower volatility stocks. The fund currently yields approximately 7.4% with more stable monthly distributions and less exposure to mega-cap tech concentration risk. JEPI combines equity-linked notes with covered calls, providing flexibility to adjust option strategies based on market conditions while maintaining consistent income generation.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading modestly lower as the big day has finally arrived: the Federal Reserve will wrap up its last meeting of 2025, and the odds still heavily favor a 25-basis-point rate hike. The worry hanging over traders is that many fear a “hawkish rate cut.” Where they do cut 25 basis points, but the commentary from Chairman Powell could be hawkish, and future cuts could be moved to the sidelines. The major indices finished mixed on Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower by 0.38% at 47,560, while the S&P 500 closed flat at 6,840. The Nasdaq put in a winning session, finishing trading at 23,576, up 0.13%. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday as bond traders, like their equity counterparts, are laser-focused on the Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the commentary that will follow. One datapoint that will be scrutinized is the JOLTS data, which showed more job openings than were expected. In addition, a $58 billion auction of 3-year notes saw strong demand, with yields clearing lower than expected, indicating good appetite for shorter-term debt. The 30-year-long bond finished the session on Tuesday at 4.81%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Following Monday’s poor showing, prices across the energy complex were lower for the second day in a row. The song remains the same: abundant supplies, combined with expectations of slowing demand, were the culprit once again. Sector analysts also cited that Iraq restored production at its giant West Qurna 2 oilfield after an export pipeline leak, adding about 460,000 barrels per day to global supply, about 0.5% of world output. Brent Crude was last seen at $62.05, down 0.70% while West Texas Intermediate closed at $58.35, down 0.90%. Natural gas took a beating for the second day running, closing at $4.56, down 7.21% on continued profit taking and weather-related fundamentals. Gold and Silver were higher on Tuesday, as rate-cut expectations provided a tailwind for the precious metals. The big story across the sector was Silver rising to a record high of $60.73 an ounce on strong industrial demand and investor interest. A real shortage of the metal boosted silver prices to record levels, as major mines faced disruptions, limiting supply. Gold was last seen on Tuesday at $4,212, up 0.56%. Crypto trading today on Tuesday showed a generally stable but slightly mixed market, with Bitcoin hovering around $90,000-$93,000, posting small daily gains or dips. At the same time, Ethereum and other major altcoins also experience minor fluctuations, with overall market cap figures fluctuating between $3.1 and $3.2 trillion and increased trading volume for some assets, such as Ethereum. Key themes include Bitcoin defending support near $90k and analysts watching for potential breakouts in specific altcoins, such as ADA. At 4 P.M. EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $93.130, while Ethereum was trading at $3,316. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

PARAMOUNT SENDS LETTER TO WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY SHAREHOLDERS Reiterates why Paramount's offer will deliver WBD shareholders with superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction Encourages shareholders to tender their shares today to register their view with the WBD Board of Directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction (1) Based on unaffected price as of September 10, 2025 (prior to WSJ leak). LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Reiterates why Paramount's offer will deliver WBD shareholders with superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction Encourages shareholders to tender their shares today to register their view with the WBD Board of Directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction (1) Based on unaffected price as of September 10, 2025 (prior to WSJ leak). LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Encourages shareholders to tender their shares today to register their view with the WBD Board of Directors that they prefer the superior Paramount transaction (1) Based on unaffected price as of September 10, 2025 (prior to WSJ leak). LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched.

The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max.

This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today sent a letter to the shareholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD"). The letter clearly sets out why Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash offer to acquire all of WBD is superior to WBD's transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Warner Bros. Discovery Shareholder: Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty.

Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors.

To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion.

WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount began pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") because we, along with our partner RedBird Capital, believe we are the best stewards not only to build long-term value for the asset but also delight audiences and help cultivate a more vibrant creative community. We funded, founded and then merged Skydance with Paramount and know the sacrifices and investment it takes to capitalize and grow a media business. I am passionate and dedicated to this pursuit, committed to putting my own money in, and that is why I am writing to you today. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Over the past 12 weeks, Paramount presented six proposals to the WBD Board of Directors and management to acquire all of WBD. On Monday, we launched a $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer to present our superior transaction to you directly. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels).

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Our tender offer documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission include the complete bid package we submitted to the WBD Board of Directors on December 4. We want you to see firsthand what Paramount proposed and what we, along with our equity and debt financing partners, were prepared to execute on that very day. Our public offer - identical to the terms we presented to WBD privately - delivers superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the transaction announced with Netflix. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF PARAMOUNT'S PROPOSAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACT NOW AND TENDER YOUR SHARES. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount's $30.00 All-Cash Offer for All of WBD Delivers Greater Value Than Netflix Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets.

Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Our offer is financially superior to Netflix's transaction, which provides WBD shareholders with lower value, less cash and significantly less certainty. On its face, Netflix is offering WBD shareholders $23.25 per share in cash, $4.50 in stock and a share in WBD's Global Networks spin-off. In reality, however, the total value is materially lower than advertised: Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY.

Netflix's cash component is ~$18 billion lower than Paramount's in the aggregate (~$7 per share). Netflix's stock price closed at $96.71 on Tuesday and, as of this writing, is trading at $93.81, more than $4 below the low-end of the collar on its stock consideration. This reduces the value of Netflix's offer. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. During the pendency of a regulatory review process that could take two years or more, WBD shareholders will be exposed to Netflix stock's downside risk, including technology sector volatility, a lofty ~25x forward EBITDA multiple and the uncertainty of seven future quarterly earnings results. For reference, Netflix has lost approximately one quarter of its market capitalization ($110+ billion) since its last quarterly earnings report and amid its pursuit of WBD. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions.

However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Buried in an 8-K filing on Friday was a mechanism providing a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the purchase price if more debt gets allocated to Streaming & Studios because of an unspecified cap on Global Networks. While the limit is undisclosed, every $1 billion above it could represent a reduction of ~$0.40 / share. Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026).

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities.

Netflix's transaction leaves WBD shareholders with 100% of the risk of the Global Networks standalone plan. As outlined on our December 8 investor call, we believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share which would mean a total headline value to WBD shareholders in the Netflix deal of $28.75 - below our $30.00 all-cash offer. This is before any risk adjustments described above and any time-value-of-money discounting of Netflix's offer to account for the substantially longer timeline to close (~$1.25 / share for every six months).1 In addition, the Netflix transaction would further exacerbate the decline of Global Networks. Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Paramount Has Air Tight Financing to Deliver on its Offer to You Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later.

To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion.

This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its $30.00 per share all-cash offer to WBD shareholders. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. As presented to the WBD Board, Paramount's offer is not subject to any financing conditions and will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. On December 3, WBD told us they wanted an Ellison family backstop on our equity financing. We delivered it to them less than 24 hours later. Our December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. In fact, the equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. To suggest that we are not "good for the money" (or might commit fraud to try to escape our obligations), as certain reports have speculated, is absurd. That absurdity is underscored by the fact that WBD and its advisors never picked up the phone or typed out a responsive text or email to raise any question or concern or to seek any clarification about either the trust or our equity commitment papers. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business.

Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Our debt commitments are not conditioned upon Paramount's financial condition nor is there any "material adverse change" condition tied to Paramount. The conditions dovetail with our proposed merger agreement, which provided maximum certainty to WBD and its shareholders. Netflix Faces Severe Regulatory Uncertainty & Closing Risk - Paramount Does Not Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming).

On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount's offer not only delivers superior value and certainty, but also a much shorter and more certain path to completion. To underscore our confidence, we have already filed for Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) approval in the United States and announced the case to the European Commission, opening the path to pre-notification discussions. We look forward to working collaboratively with the relevant authorities to work through the review process and deliver this transaction to you and our other stakeholders. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders).

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. WBD's transaction with Netflix, on the other hand, appears to be in for a long and bumpy ride as it navigates the global regulatory review process. Netflix is the #1 streaming business globally by subscriber count and HBO Max is #4. Combining these two yields an overwhelming market share of ~43% - more than 2x the #2. This is in addition to the other serious competition concerns raised, including from vertically integrating WBD's film and TV production studios into Netflix, which will give Netflix greater leverage over theatrical exhibitors and creative talent alike. Notably, and as an indicator of its global dominance, Netflix's current equity market capitalization dwarfs that of all other major media companies and theatrical exhibitors combined (even after the above-mentioned $110+ billion loss in value): Outside the United States, Netflix's regulatory path is particularly challenged in Europe where its dominance is far more entrenched. Our analysis was conducted by the former deputies of merger enforcements for the European Commission and the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming service in Europe, accounting for 51% of the total European OTT subscription revenue in 2024, with Disney a distant second at only 10%. The acquisition of WBD's Streaming & Studios business is a blatant attempt to eliminate one of Netflix's only viable international competitors in HBO Max. Market share analysis aside, Netflix also needs to satisfy Europe's new landmark Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act created for a situation precisely like this - protecting consumers from Big Tech overreach. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The argument being advanced publicly by Netflix and its proxies states that regulators should ignore the SVOD market and instead utilize a gerrymandered market definition that includes services like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Netflix's claim boils down to trying to mask its dominance in SVOD by grouping together all internet-enabled video, media, social media, or otherwise. No regulator has ever accepted such a broad approach to market definition, and to do so would require regulators to give up on merger enforcement in media and social media alike. It is noteworthy that, unlike Paramount's willingness to agree to remedies up to a "material adverse effect" on the combined company, Netflix's regulatory remedy commitments expressly state no remedy whatsoever can be imposed on Netflix's business. Netflix also has a longer timeline - an "outside date" of 21 months. Paramount backed up its commitments with a $5 billion regulatory reverse termination fee. Netflix's incremental $800 million over that amount does not close the gap between the differences in regulatory complexity and challenges. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer.

This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. For the avoidance of doubt, our $6 billion synergy estimate does not rely on cuts to content budgets at our studios and we intend to continue running both separately post-close. Our synergy analysis relies on efficiencies elsewhere across the combined organization, including technology, linear networks optimization, and real estate rationalization. Having experienced what it is like to act in and produce films first-hand, I have profound respect for creative talent. This is why we are fully pro-Hollywood, dedicated to supporting a growing theatrical slate of over 30 films per year and investing in the people and storytelling that drive the industry forward.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. WBD's Murky Sale Process Over the last few days, we have heard from WBD shareholders and other stakeholders all asking the same question - what happened? Frankly, we are asking the same question. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The WBD sale "process" was unusual in that, over the entire period, its advisors never delivered to Paramount a single markup of any of our transaction documents - not our merger agreement nor our equity commitment documents. In addition, there was not a single "real time" negotiating session with us. When Paramount submitted its fifth proposal on December 1, a proposal accompanied by full transaction documents that we stated we were prepared to sign, we offered $26.50 / share in cash. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. On December 3, WBD provided feedback on Paramount's proposal and communicated that the WBD Board would be "meeting periodically over the course of this week" but they never asked for a re-bid (which is strange if your goal is to maximize value for shareholders). On that call, our advisors asked whether the WBD Board continued to prioritize cash consideration as they had consistently communicated to us. WBD's lead advisor's response: "Isn't cash always king?" One must ask: was that same message being delivered to Netflix? Despite the opaque process, Paramount proactively submitted a revised offer with full transaction documentation in under 24 hours (at 11:00 am ET on December 4) and stated that Paramount and our funding sources were ready to sign it immediately. This revised offer addressed all of the scarce feedback that Paramount received. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year.

The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Yet on that final pivotal day when WBD's fate hung in the balance, we received not a single call, text or email to clarify anything about Paramount's $30 per share all cash offer. Instead, and while in possession of our superior and fully committed bid and documents that entire day, the WBD Board and its advisors sprinted toward a deal with Netflix (even ignoring two separate texts from myself and Paramount's advisors stating that we had never said "best and final"). WBD Shareholders Have the Power to Get WBD on the Right Path Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026.

We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Our proposal represents a compelling opportunity for WBD shareholders. We are committed to seeing this transaction through. Since Monday, we have had the opportunity to speak with a number of WBD shareholders who have expressed confusion and disappointment at the process that WBD conducted, which appears to have prioritized a deal with Netflix over shareholder value maximization. Multiple equity research notes published over the last 48 hours have also agreed that our offer is superior and that the Global Networks spin-off does not close the gap to $30.00 in cash. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA.

What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. From here, you can expect WBD to respond to our tender offer within 10 business days via a 14D-9 filing with the SEC. Our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days. The closing of the tender offer is conditioned upon, among other things, a majority of WBD shares tendering in our favor, receipt of regulatory approvals, termination of the Netflix merger agreement and entry into a definitive merger agreement with us. WE URGE YOU TO REGISTER YOUR VIEW WITH THE WBD BOARD THAT YOU DEEM PARAMOUNT'S OFFER TO BE SUPERIOR BY TENDERING YOUR SHARES TODAY. Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels).

Sincerely, David Ellison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paramount Skydance Corporation Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Tender Offer Process FAQs The below frequently asked questions provide a summary of relevant information for shareholders looking to understand more about Paramount's tender offer. Full details of the tender offer can be found here. Why should I tender my shares? Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer. For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery ("WBD") for $30.00 per share. We believe our offer provides superior value through a simple all-cash structure and a quicker, clearer path to completion than the transaction that WBD agreed to with Netflix. It is not too late to get the benefits of Paramount's offer if you act now. By tendering your shares, you are registering your view with the WBD Board of Directors that Paramount's offer is superior to the Netflix transaction. How do I tender my shares? If you are the record holder of your shares: Mail the following to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, which is acting as depositary in the offer, at one of the addresses specified in the Letter of Transmittal: the certificates representing your shares; completed Letter of Transmittal; and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. The mailing must occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026 (unless further extended by Paramount). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (a "Broker")): Request that your Broker effect the transaction for you. Each such Broker will detail the process in its communication to you about the offer. Contact Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi"), our information agent, at the number or email set forth below for assistance with tendering your shares or with any other specific questions about the offer.

A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities.

These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction.

This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction.

For detailed instructions on procedures for tendering your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 3-Procedure for Tendering Shares," which can be accessed here. A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate.

The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025.

A form of the Letter of Transmittal is filed as an exhibit to the Schedule TO-T filed by Paramount with the SEC, which form can be accessed here. When should I tender my shares? The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

(the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The sooner you tender your shares the better. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2026, which date may be extended by Paramount. Can I withdraw my tender if I change my mind? Yes. You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here. Who should I call with questions about tendering my shares? You may direct questions and requests for assistance to Okapi. Banks and brokerage firms can call (212) 297-0720, and shareholders and all others can call toll-free (844) 343-2621. They can also be reached via email at info@okapipartners.com. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate.

You may withdraw your previously tendered shares at any time before the expiration date. Generally, following the expiration, all tendered shares are irrevocable. However, if Paramount has not accepted the shares tendered for payment pursuant to the offer by February 9, 2026 (the first business day after the 60th day following commencement of the tender offer), you may also withdraw your previously tendered shares after such date (i.e., on or after February 10, 2026). For additional information on the limitations to and procedures for withdrawing your shares, please see the section of the Offer to Purchase entitled "The Offer-Section 4-Withdrawal Rights," which can be accessed here.

Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Other Questions We Have Heard From WBD Shareholders What is the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust u/a/d 1/22/88 (the "Trust")? Larry Ellison's Trust holds substantially all of Mr. Ellison's assets, including 1.158 billion shares of Oracle Corporation (approximate value on 12/9/25 of $257 billion). The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Trust was formed in 1988 and, along with its many wholly owned subsidiaries, has engaged in many thousands of transactions since that time, with no intention to change the way it does business. The Trust has participated in multiple large-scale transactions and has been vetted by public companies and most of the largest banks in the US. By way of example, the Trust backstopped a multi-billion-dollar equity investment to fund Skydance's acquisition of Paramount and funded a $1 billion investment in Twitter's take-private (which was advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, WBD's legal counsel). The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming).

WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com. About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Trust has direct banking relationships with each of the four largest US banks and six of the top ten US banks (as measured by total assets). Any concern that the Trust would take any steps to avoid its obligations (i.e., commit fraud) is meritless and, if such a concern is ever directly raised with the Trust, we will happily address it in the paperwork. Did the Trust submit an equity backstop in support of Paramount's bid for WBD? Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming).

These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Yes, the Trust submitted an equity backstop for $40.4 billion dollars. The paperwork submitted in the bid for WBD represents a completely customary and enforceable equity financing commitment and is identical in all material respects to the equity financing terms in the Paramount/Skydance transaction and other large leveraged buyouts (e.g., Twitter). However, to the extent that WBD raises legitimate concerns about the terms of the equity financing, the Trust will happily address such concerns in the transaction documentation. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Should Global Networks trade in line with Versant (Comcast's pending spinoff)? Versant is not yet a public company. Regular way trading will begin on January 5, 2026. At the moment, equity research analysts estimate that it will trade at ~4-5x NTM EBITDA. We believe Global Networks is worth ~$1 / share, which is based on a 4.5x EV / next twelve months EBITDA for the business as of Q3'26 (when WBD expects to close its separation). While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

About Paramount, a Skydance Corporation Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) is a leading, next‑generation global media and entertainment company, comprised of three business segments: Filmed Entertainment, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media.

Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. While we believe Versant is a good comp for Global Networks, Global Networks should trade at a material discount to Versant given: Versant will be significantly less leveraged (~1.25x net leverage for Versant vs. >3x for Global Networks) Versant's live news and sports portfolio, which we believe is the highest value category in Pay TV, far outpaces Global Networks: Live news and sports account for ~62% of Versant's audience vs ~20% for WBD. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Compared to Global Networks' CNN and Turner networks (which essentially lost all sports rights following the loss of NBA rights), Versant owns a robust portfolio of some of the most valuable live news and sports channels including CNBC, MS Now (formerly MSNBC), the Golf Channel and USA. Its live sports rights are contracted until ~2028-2036 and include the English Premier League, the Olympics, the WNBA, WWE, the PGA Tour and NASCAR, among others. A large portion of Versant's business is in digital, higher growth assets (e.g., GolfNow, Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango), whereas Global Networks' only major digital asset is Bleacher Report. Versant is much less weighted toward lower value lifestyle and reality content that Global Networks specializes in (e.g., HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channels). What is included in the $6 billion+ run-rate cost synergy target? We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

(the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. We are very focused on maintaining the creative engines of the combined company, Our synergies estimate is driven by duplicative operations across all aspects of the business - specifically, back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure and real estate. Our content savings estimate reflects only a <10% reduction of combined spend, none of which is derived from film/TV studios. As we have mentioned several times, we do not plan to reduce theatrical output - we intend to grow our slate to over 30 films each year. Instead, we expect to make smarter decisions about licensing across linear networks and streaming. On a combined basis, we still expect to lead the industry in content spending (~$35 billion annually vs. Netflix's publicly announced expectation of ~$18 billion for 2025). It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. It is important to note that context matters. Because it is only buying part of WBD, Netflix's $2-3 billion announced synergy target in its transaction does not include any savings from Global Networks - WBD's largest segment by SG&A in 2024 ($2.8 billion, vs. $2.4 billion in Studios and $2.2 billion in Streaming). The suggestion that Paramount's plan relies on deeper job cuts than Netflix's is not supported by any facts.

Title: 35 Supposed “Luxuries” That Are One Big Giant Scam To Take Rich People’s Money

We often buy into the idea that paying a higher price guarantees a better product. Many of us assume that the more something costs, the better its quality or value. However, luxury industry insiders say this couldn’t be further from the truth. A recent Reddit post asked, “People who work in ‘luxury’ industries (5-star hotels, fine dining, high-end brands): what is a complete rip-off that rich people happily pay for?” The eye-opening responses revealed that premium prices don’t always mean superior quality. In some cases, the wealthy are simply paying for something that boosts their image, as savvy businesspeople know rich folks will happily shell out the big bucks on anything that creates the illusion of exclusivity and wealth. Image source: Nathandg27, Elina Sazonova/Pexels Honestly the markup on wine at fine dining restaurants is insane. i worked as a hostess and watched people drop $300 on bottles we got wholesale for like $40 without even blinking. Image source: Best_Needleworker530, Mizuno K/Pexels Less common but the most vile scam I’ve seen. I worked for a restaurant that wanted to be on a higher income shelf, in the middle of a white men in finance and gilets district. Very popular business breakfast spot. They had a huge oven near the expo and you could see freshly baking sourdough bread. The oven was not actually “baking”, it was set on something like 40 C so the bread was kept nicely warm but definitely not freshly baked. We didn’t even bake it on site, it was delivered in the morning and put in the oven, as a display. If someone ordered “bread and olives” or “charcuterie board” from the menu we would make a whole event of getting that bread out, slicing, arranging and serving. You would then expect any other order that had bread in there to get THIS bread. Yeah, no. Any order, like things containing toast, full English, avo toasts etc had generic Warburtons used. FOH staff had to deal with complaints about it left right and centre. I lasted 3 weeks, the restaurant about a year more after I left. Image source: habilishn, Ron Lach/Pexels If you make your product rare. we are very small olive oil producers, we have all the machines to completely produce the oils ourselves. we work very clean and organic in a way that goes beyond any certificates, so we won’t fool anyone on this side. BUT there is certain special oils, ie. the very early harvest, or oil from wild olive trees. we have some wealthy customers, if we tell them we only have 10L of wild olive oil left, they want to buy it all… only to know that they have it and noone else. so we found ourselves lying sometimes about the amount of oil left, it makes certain rich people buy everything available just to have it 🤷🏻‍♂️. Medical woo. They will pay $200 to put their feet in a little tub of ionized water for 30 minutes while the metals in the water oxidize and turn it a color – THEN they find out which toxins they released based on the color (spoiler alert – it’s always brown/copper). It’s complete and total nonsense and that’s the *cheapest* one I can think of. They’ll drop thousands on stuff like this without a second thought. Image source: Syntra44 Image source: thehonestypolicy, Ron Lach/Pexels My brother works fine dining as a manager. Someone once wanted a sparkler on top of a dessert and the restaurant didn’t want to do it. My brother said “sure we can do that. For $500.” And the person did it. Now they have a box of sparklers available in the kitchen for requests and the restaurant gets $500 a pop. And once one dessert gets the showy sparkler walked through the dining room, past all the other couples celebrating or bachelorette parties or people who won big (it’s at a casino), then EVERYONE wants to get a sparkler. Blows my mind. Image source: UglyT, JESHOOTS.com/Pexels I once DJ’d in a casino in Macau. The VIP tables would competitively send bottles of champagne to each other’s tables just to signal their wealth. It would be announced over the PA system, but nobody would get the champagne. The bottles never actually existed! It would be like “Table 10 sends 5 bottles of champagne to Table 4” “Table 4 is sending 15 bottles of champagne to Table 10” “Table 10 is sending 30 bottles of champagne to Table 4” Etc Etc This kept on going until they were up to like 200 bottles of champagne. They weren’t friends or anything – they were just showing their wealth off to this other table. They got a few symbolic bottles with indoor fireworks taken to the table by girls, but that’s it. I asked the owner what it was about and he said they can pick them up on another day if they want, but nobody ever does – it’s purely for show. Insane. Image source: HemlockHex, Inga Seliverstova/Pexels I do high end cocktail bartending. One of the rules I live by is that the difference in a $11 and a $30 drink is purely presentation. The glass needs to be immaculately polished, the ice needs to be in good condition, and the garnish needs to be skillfully prepared. Additionally, you need the right space to sell $30 drinks, you need clean surfaces and enough hands to ensure a consistently pre-bussed bar-top. All of that has zilch to do with how good the drink actually tastes. It’s the real problem with most bartenders, I find. Making delicious drinks is important, but presentability is what sets the price tag and perceived value. Image source: transemacabre, Jose Ricardo Barraza Morachis/Pexels One of the more interesting ones is having expensive replicas made of priceless jewelry in case of theft. My surrogate dad in Nassau county, Long Island knows of people who spent thousands and thousands of dollars on “costume” dupes of their best jewelry so they can wear that out and leave the real stuff at home under lock and key. Imagine a set of costume jewelry worth more than your vehicle. That sort of thing. Image source: Wild-Vast-2559, Anıl Karakaya/Pexels I work for a high-end plumbing company. We do some truly enormous new residential builds. The difference between regular and high end plumbing is purely aesthetic. All our pipes are meticulously organized and ran with non-flexible materials. We essentially do satisfying cable management but for pipes. It looks nice and wealthy customers like nice looking things. . Image source: yournorthernbuddy, Pavel Danilyuk/Pexels Dignity, as a valet at a billionaire hangout we had all sorts of regulars that would pay (to us) ridiculous amounts in an attempt to embarrass us. A notable one is the fellow who came in with a $100 bill about once a week and asked me to tie his shoes. He’d step out of his Rolls Royce Cullinan with one shoe untied and money in hand. As best we could tell, it was to demean us into servants’ tasks or whatever, but really it’s a pittance to him but equal to 8 hours labor for me. So we always did it. Image source: triple_hoop, Omotayo Samuel/Pexels The “VIP Lounge access” in night clubs , it’s basically milking a person with low self esteem. Image source: BasenjiMaster, Anna Tarazevich/Pexels Gold flakes on things. My ex worked in the hotel industry. The rich would buy anything that sounded or presented itself as expensive. Gold flakes are really cheap, they put that on/in anything and they can up the price 3x or more. Image source: JaxyKun, RDNE Stock project/Pexels Private jet pilot here. Catering services. There’s companies that, for a lack of a better word, cater specifically to the corporate jet world to provide food for the aircraft that is delivered to the fixed base operators for the departure. This is stuff like Asian salads for like 150$ or a club sandwich for 80$. (these are rough estimates based on what our dispatch has told me I’ve never personally ordered them) Many of our part 91 (owner flights) the aircraft owners are watching their expenses closely and as such don’t order these because it’s a ridiculous waste of money to get Panera quality food for 150$ when they could just ask us pilots to pickup Panera for them on the way to the aircraft. The people who don’t realize this or care and will often run up over 1000$ for a handful of salads and sandwiches are those who charter the aircraft and get shafted by these companies or their broker. Image source: Epicfaux, Addilyn Ragsdill @clockworklemon.com/Unsplash Truffle oil. I’ve worked at some crazy high end places, and they’ll often use the same stuff from Spectrum.. whis is not truffle oil as much as it is a gasoline byproduct 🤢 Image source: Legendary_Lamb2020, Ivan S/Pexels I worked construction for a couple years in my 20’s. I was the only white or college educated guy on the crew. It was a regular occurrence while working on wealthy people’s properties that they would request that I personally return for side projects, even though everyone else on the crew was much more skilled and harder working than me. My billionaire real estate client was having me go back and forth with the selling realtor on a property over a $10k difference in what he wanted to pay on a multi million dollar vacant lot. He made a point of telling me he and his wife were sipping a $10k bottle of port while having me work around over 10k on the property. Also the most unhappy client Ive ever had. Rich and unhappy ain’t no way to live. Image source: Rockchef Image source: CapnGrundlestamp, AJ Ahamad/Pexels The mini bar. They’ll drink and eat everything in there without a second thought. $27 bottle of water? Well they’re rich and thirsty. I used to book hotel rooms for Disney. The El Capitan Suite at the Grand Californian Hotel runs about $10,000 a night. Don’t get me wrong, it’s an extremely beautiful suite with top-tier everything, but it will never be anything but crazy and wasteful to spend $10,000 for the privilege of sleeping in a room. Image source: RilohKeen Image source: EuphoricEditor5133, Shots by Sandhu/Pexels The “exclusive” hotel car service is wild… it’s literally a regular suv with a logo and they upcharge like it’s a chauffeured spaceship. Turn-down service in ultra‑luxury hotels is one of the biggest ones. It’s basically someone folding the corner of your blanket, dimming a light, and leaving a chocolate, yet it gets bundled into rooms that cost hundreds more per night. People love it I guess because it feels exclusive, not because it actually does anything. Image source: throwawayjaaay Image source: TJayClark, Andrea Piacquadio/Pexels Hotels The difference between a $75 room and $150-200 room is usually massive The difference between a $200 room and a $800+ room is a lot of small things that most people like, but wouldn’t spent $600+ on. Image source: LessBig715, Lukas/Pexels Catering that they don’t even eat. My wife works at an FBO at PBI. It’s where the Uber rich land their private jets. They order all this really good food that goes untouched. All in individual containers wrapped up. I’m talking thick cuts of prime rib, vegetables, mash potatoes all in one container. Lucky for me, the food that wasn’t opened gets split up with my wife and her coworkers. You wouldn’t believe some of the stuff these rich people leave behind. Several months ago my wife came home with one of those big Yeti cooler bags, the thing is over $400, and it was left. I have worked in high end retail for a decade at several well known luxury companies. Most of the time, I will be honest with clients, but sometimes we make truly ugly items that rich people fawn over. If they’re in love with it, even though I think it’s ugly, I will talk it up. Afterwards, we’ll talk among ourselves and say rich people will buy anything. Also employees in these luxury brands 99% of the time, never pay full price. We trade discounts with each other. A personal opinion of mine is that Louis Vuitton is over hyped and not worth the money. You can get something more unique at another brand. They also pay their employees the lowest of any high end brand. I struggle to even call them a luxury brand with how completely oversaturated their market is, and also the fact that their most popular canvas bags are actually just plastic (looking at you, Never Full tote). Image source: genghis-san Image source: lefund, Ron Lach/Pexels Clothing industry here. People will blindly play a premium for items made in certain countries because they believe anything made in _______ is so much better than anywhere else Truth is country of manufacture means very little compared to what factory/workshop it’s made in Portugal, Turkey, Bosnia, Romania and Moldova are generally considered countries with high quality control standards, good wages and actually having talented craftsmen Truth is that Portugal and Turkey are significantly cheaper to manufacture a tee shirt/hoodie than Italy, Spain, France or UK because they produce so many plus they have lower taxes for corporations. As for Bosnia, Romania and Moldova (in a lot of cases Turkey too) this is where the “sweatshops” of Europe operate. Their labour is significantly cheaper than other European countries and theres less things they are legally required to provide to workers so they can get away paying someone half or less than they’d get in Italy or UK. Because of this you also see way less skilled workers and it’s more like an assembly line that you’d find in an Asian or Latin American country. Also it’s not as expensive as people think to even produce in the good countries. Zara, Topman and many other mall brands have lines made in Turkey, Portugal or Peru (all countries known for really good cotton). Truth is the cost to make a tee there ranges from $3.50-20 generally depending how many you make and choice of material + print process. It’s nothing crazy and the rest is markup. Whether you want to pay the premium for the look or brand is up to you but for example Pangaia and Givenchy tee/hoodies are produced in the same Portuguese workshop. Pangaia averages around $50usd a tee while Givenchy is $700usd. While Givenchy does use nicer fabric and a more luxurious finishing overall you’re really looking at a tee that costs $8 to make vs one that costs probably $14. The Givenchy markup is all because it’s luxury/exclusive and they market as that Tied into this, some countries that get a bad wrap (China, India and Mexico mainly) aren’t always bad. China for example is really good at technical clothing like windbreakers and sportswear + plastic and acetate eyewear. Mexico makes really good leather shoes and boots. India is great at intricate woven fabrics. A lot of companies will produce in these countries because they have the set up to do these things on a large scale and would be significantly cheaper + faster to produce than to do the same thing in a more “reputable” place like the USA, would be equal or better quality too Judge every product/brand on a case by case basis and don’t generalize anything just because of the country it’s made in. I worked in a five star hotel and the biggest rip off was bottled water service. We would charge absurd amounts for a brand you could get at any store. Guests acted like it tasted different because it came with a cold towel and a smile lol. Image source: CutiePieDol Image source: Super_Commercial9195, Luna Lovegood/Pexels Work in fine dining as a cook. Sure the $80 steaks are a thing and so is a $20 creme brulee. But probably the thing that’s the biggest ripoff that sells like gangbusters is the up to $180 charcuterie board. Yes it looks pretty and has very expensive meat and cheese on it but it’s mostly filled out with nuts pickled veg and crustini and a few dips. In all on that board there’s maybe $15 or $20 worth of product and it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to assemble each (after the meats are sliced but that’s all done in prep in the afternoon.) The margins on that are better than even most alcohol save perhaps nice wine. People love their chart ( pronunciation shart) and just pay out the nose for it. Fours sharts coming right up. . Former luxury hotel room service coordinator (answered phones, did office work) here. All the food, but particularly booze. The markup is INSANE. Pro baseball players like (lots and lots of) cheap beer and will pay 3x for it after we basically grab it from the grocery store down the block to emergency restock after they drink it all. Don’t even get me started on the liquor – absolutely eye watering price-per-shot even for the crappy stuff (and we could tell who knew what they were doing vs. who was ordering what they thought was fancy, but they all overpaid). But the worst is honestly what people *didn’t* pay for. There’s something so odious about giving super rich people free stuff. I’m sitting there barely able to afford to eat, working 40+ hours per week, comping drinks and sending out elaborate free amenities to people who are spending more for their stay than I make in month. Image source: Princess_Zelda_Fitzg Image source: theRealHalIncandenza, Godisable Jacob/Pexels I worked in luxury fashion . Not sure if this is relevant but I’ve seen hundreds of thousands in actual cash spent on purses. I worked at Celine and was even offered a job in France at one point. We had an alligator purse that at the time was priced at 35k $ . Had two in stock. Sold one to a Saudi Royal family member . They came in and shut the store down. We were all called to the floor . The Saudi family had a black truck deliver two gym bags full of American cash . Hundreds of thousands. My store manager and her assistant were busy running bills through the counter . Family left spending nearly a quarter million on purses and jackets from Celine. Image source: onyxS4int, Pavel Danilyuk/Pexels Caskets and urns, I work in a fancier funeral home as support staff (not a director). We literally sell $80 urns imported from India for $600+. A $2000 casket goes for $8000. Remember that you are allowed under federal law to bring your own urn or casket. Sometimes I feel like there is more financial flexing at funerals than at weddings. Image source: Martin0994, Ketut Subiyanto/Pexels Travelling during peak season. That $1800 room sells for $400 in the fall. I want to say room service, but it’s a pure lazy tax. You pay that same lazy tax when you use Uber Eats. IME, you get what you pay for. Certain properties in certain markets might have a specific thing that gets you, but generally you can get what you’re paying for. Image source: Scrimps, Shots by Sandhu/Pexels Clothing. The average rich person is not buying Bespoke clothes. They are paying $300 for a hoodie that costs $7 to produce. Often in the same factory that produces clothing for mass market retailers. I know someone who owns (family) a small factory who has had a Canada Goose contract for well over a decade. Even an extremely complex and complicated jacket like those from Canada Goose, which are some of the most complicated garments produced on a large scale. Costs around $95 each, even accounting for Canadian wages. Image source: Separate-Command1993, John Taran/Pexels I’m a high end AV Engineer, think 150k+ speakers and home theaters/smart house stuff. People will pay THOUSANDS of dollars for speaker wire that is twisted a certain number of times in a certain configuration that’s supposed to prevent EMI and improve sound quality. It’s all BS to a degree, the human ear can’t hear the differences. Image source: anon, Szymon Shields/Pexels Cook here! I’ve worked fine dining exclusively, for over a decade. Mostly country clubs, currently at a high end hotel chain with locations in multiple countries. Everything on the menu. It’s everything. We mark up everything to such an insane degree that the kitchen staff alone account for half the luxury vehicles in the front lot. You paid 176 (ish) USD over wholesale for that caviar, so the dishwasher can drive a G Wagon. We can charge 6 dollars for a fried egg because we say so. You could buy a dozen eggs for the price of one fried egg at a luxury hotel. Its not a special egg. It’s the same brand as the diner down the street. I’ve been there. I’ve seen the eggs they use. You could probably get 3 eggs there, for the same price as the one egg I will make you. I will make you a 47 dollar burger that uses the same beef and the same buns as a sit down burger place. Our food is not priced to be reasonable. It’s priced the way it is, *exclusively because we can*. Some of the people I serve are so wealthy that they don’t even ask for a bill. They just charge it to their room, with no concern for how much they’ve spent. We had a lady a couple days ago, who ordered a gorgeous tomahawk ribeye for her dogs to share. They didn’t like it. She threw it away, and just shook her head at her dogs. I know because I asked like I cared about her dogs preference. We have a once a year regular. Pretty sure homie is one of those people who is so wealthy that he doesn’t exist in our mortal realm, like his world is his own, and his alone. He comes in like he is a regular dude with disposable income. Wears New Balance sneakers, Kirkland khakis, and a polo. Single suitcase, no fanfare. He orders all of his food basically free style. Nothing is ever *off* the menu to him. 4 egg whites (6 dollars each), fine herbs (I think we charge like 5 bucks), brie (depends on what we have on hand, but let’s say 10 bucks a serving), braised beef cheek (a dinner item we always have. He pays full price of 62.99), and a side of fruit (10 bucks). This is what he eats both mornings he is here, every single summer, like clockwork. He drinks two double Kettle One Caesars, sometimes a Latte, and leaves a generous tip. Usually his breakfast comes out to a couple hundred dollars, more if he has company. Its all really worth maybe 50 bucks. At absolute best. Our food is very good, but we are catering to people who don’t just have disposable income, they have incomparable amounts of income, and we take full advantage of that. We feel no guilt for this, because they never ever ever complain. Bottle service at a nightclub. Imagine paying a 1000% markup on a bottle of Grey Goose that typically costs $50. Image source: jinsanity811 Image source: RoswellRedux, Pixabay/Pexels The high-end restaurants in 5-star resorts and hotels use a lot of pre-packaged frozen foods. They dress it up with sauce and fancy presentation, but just know that your Chicken Cordon Bleu came from a box. Same with your fancy dessert UNLESS the 5-star has a designated pastry chef. Many don’t. It’s all in the name of lowering Food Cost. (disclosure: I’ve worked as an accountant in resort hospitality for over 20 yrs. We know what gets purchased and carried in inventory.)

Title: Inside tractor maker CNH’s push to bring more artificial intelligence to the farm
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/10/artificial-intelligence-cnh-ai-tractors-farm-equipment/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jay Schroeder, the chief technology officer of CNH, was recently in Brazil, discussing artificial intelligence use cases to support the company’s research and development team. The agricultural equipment maker has put a lot of effort into governance and assessing certified tools from vendors, but the actual application of the technology within its own research division remains very nascent. What has held Schroeder back, he says, are lingering concerns about the return on investment of AI. He cites an MIT study published over the summer that found that 95% of AI pilots fail. “It’s great that we’ve got people engaged in AI,” says Schroeder, who quickly pivots to ask rhetorically, “How do we measure success? What are the things that we can measure to say, ‘This has been a worthwhile investment for CNH?’” Schroeder, a three-decade veteran of CNH who began his career as an engineer focused on mid-range tractor transmission design, isn’t completely cautious when it comes to leveraging AI. The tech has been deployed across broad corners of the business including software development, to assist with drafting contracts, producing R&D database queries, and content management. CNH has scored some wins that Schroeder has been able to track. The company is leaning on AI to assist software engineers who are focused on precision agricultural technology and the FieldOps farm management systems, where AI, machine learning, and sensors are applied to digitally enhance farming. Early data has shown that these engineers are reducing the time needed for documentation by 60%, giving them more time to write new code. Another project underway involves AI-enabled spraying systems that use cameras and machine learning to detect the difference between weeds and planted crops when applying chemicals in the field. Farmers who use AI in this manner can reduce the amount of herbicides they use by 80%. Other applications have more nebulous gains. CNH’s engineers participated in a pilot program where they were able to use AI to pull field reports from dispersed datasets across the company. Within three minutes, this generative AI tool can produce a report that includes details about a design project, CNH’s standards for developing the gear, field test reports, and other key information. “Can you measure that?” asks Schroeder. He says that many hours are being saved from the work that would have gone into developing one of those reports manually in the past. But putting an exact figure on the time savings is more difficult. Investments in AI and other emerging technologies, like autonomous robots, have become central to the pitch made by CNH and other tractor suppliers as farmers face intense cost pressures and feelthe dire effects of climate change. In the United Kingdom, where the Dutch-incorporated CNH has its headquarters and main operations, heat and drought led to around $1 billion in lost production this year. Three of the five worst harvests in the history of the U.K. have occurred since 2020, according to the figures from the U.K.-based nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. Only 3% of the world’s land is suitable for crops, but the global population is growing by 35 million each year, according to CNH. Farmers have to squeeze out more efficiencies in the field to meet that rising demand. “The biggest impact on a farmer’s profitability is the yield, besides commodity prices, obviously,” says Gerrit Marx, CEO of CNH, which ranks No. 217 on the Fortune 500 Europe. “In the end, we want to help the farmer make better decisions.” Farm-equipment suppliers have been squeezed by the impact of tariffs, which has led to weakening demand for their expensive tractors, combines, and harvesters. Last month, CNH reported weaker year-over-year sales for the company’s third quarter, as shipments slowed to dealers that have been working their way through excess inventories. But even as it faces those headwinds, CNH has vowed to invest nearly $5 billion over five years into its U.S. manufacturing and R&D facilities. “The solutions we’re developing for AG [agriculture] are really helping to feed the world,” says Schroeder. “I grew up on a family farm…so for me, it’s personal.” CNH’s primary technology partner is Microsoft, and the company has been in active conversations with the tech giant to deploy some AI tools to support precision-technology product development. Already, all CNH employees have access to the free, web-based version of Microsoft Copilot, and about 1,000 of the “AI power users” have access to the premium license. The company’s precision agricultural tech AI projects, Schroeder says, are still “mostly in the pilot phase. We have a long hill to climb.” One AI tool that CNH launched externally at the beginning of 2025 is the “AI Tech Assistant,” which was deployed to hundreds of agricultural and construction dealer groups to field questions about any issues for CNH-branded machinery and propose a repair plan. Marx says that every member of CNH’s global leadership team is running at least one generative or agentic AI pilot program within their respective fields. He says CNH is looking for tangible benefits to business outcomes. One area of increased focus is the application of generative AI to produce conversational, real-time insights that can connect the dots between the seeds, fertilizers, and equipment a farmer has at their disposal, as well as current and near-future weather patterns, to help improve crop management and planning. “Tomorrow, the agronomist will become a set of agentic AIs that help the farmer to make bigger decisions better,” says Marx. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. The emerging federal-versus-state battle to regulate AI. In the wake of around 100 different laws adopted by 38 states during this year’s legislative session, President Trump this week moved to issue an executive order that would aim to prevent state's from passing laws restricting AI. Over-regulating AI, Trump and his allies believe, will make it harder for the U.S. to compete with China. But state governors have expressed fears about the impact of AI—on hiring and employment, consumer protection, fraud, and other risks—motivating them to act in absence of federal regulations. Nvidia wins Trump’s blessing to sell AI chips in China. On Tuesday, Trump announced that he had granted Nvidia permission to sell the company’s H200 AI chip to China, giving the AI chip maker an opportunity to chase billions in orders from the market that would purportedly only go to “approved customers.” But, the Financial Timesreported that China would limit access to H200 chips and that buyers would likely need to go through an approval process that would require them to explain why domestic providers are unable to meet their needs. Nike cuts CTO role; Deere CIO retires. Athletic-gear giant Nike has eliminated two C-suite roles, including the CTO position, as CEO Elliott Hill aims to eliminate “layers” to accelerate a turnaround plan. CTO Muge Dogan is departing after just two years in the role. She previously spent more than 16 years at Amazon. Meanwhile, Deere & Co. announced that CIO Raj Kalathur would retire in January after 28 years at the agricultural machinery manufacturer. Kalathur has served as CIO since 2019 and oversaw Deere’s IT function and John Deere Financial, the financial-services provider for dealers and customers that buy the company’s equipment. Deere didn’t provide further details on who would succeed Kalathur. IBM scoops up Confluent for $11 billion. Shares of data-streaming platform Confluent jumped after the company agreed to a $31-per-share cash takeover offer from IBM. It's one of the tech giant’s largest takeovers ever in a deal that will bolster its AI offerings. IBM says that it expects that global data demand will more than double by 2028 and asserts that the IBM-Confluent combination will enable better and faster deployment of generative and agentic AI. As Bloomberg reports, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has led efforts to reposition the company’s business around selling AI-related services to clients and buying up software companies. Those efforts appear to be paying off, with around 80% of IBM’s 300 clients who buy AI products being new over the past two quarters, IBM told the Wall Street Journal when it reported earnings in October. New York Times, Chicago Tribune sue Perplexity. The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune have sued Perplexity, saying the AI startup is copying and distributing their exclusive content. This adds to a growing list of more than 40 court cases in the U.S. in which copyright holders have sued AI companies, the Times reports. The Times was also in court last week for its ongoing litigation with OpenAI, with the latter suffering a legal blow after a federal judge ruled that the ChatGPT maker must produce millions of anonymized chat logs from its users in a copyright case that stems from a late 2023 lawsuit by the news organization. EY says that AI-driven gains are being pumped into reinvestment, not job cuts. While headlines continue to swirl around AI's impact on jobs—including the recent report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas that AI has been responsible for nearly 55,000 job layoffs in 2025—consulting giant EY is making the case that savings in AI are far more likely to be poured back into the business. Nearly all business leaders (96%) report AI-driven gains in productivity, but they are far more focused on reinvesting than eliminating jobs. When asked what they've done with the dollars saved from AI, these leaders report spending to support existing AI capabilities (47%), develop new AI capabilities (42%), strengthen cybersecurity (41%), invest in R&D (39%), and upskilling and reskilling employees (38%), according to consulting giant EY’s fourth AI Pulse Survey. Only 17% report those gains led to reduced headcount. “We see that a lot of companies are coming back with positive returns and are getting even more bullish in what their investment theses are,” Dan Diasio, EY global consulting AI leader, tells Fortune. “More of those executives are putting more capital towards AI, many of them doubling what their investments were over the course of the next 12 months.” The EY survey data aligns with Diasio's thinking. About 27% of respondents currently commits a quarter or more of their IT budget to AI, but that share of respondents is projected to nearly double to 52% in 2026. The group that spends half or more of their IT budget on AI is expected to quintuple, to 19% next year from just 3% today.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…

Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Warner Bros. Discovery-Paramount-Netflix drama has Hollywood in a tizzy this week — but it's missing one big thing: What about you? Americans are deep in a new era of entertainment and are increasingly likely to get their fix on YouTube and TikTok rather than with WBD's popular franchises like Harry Potter and "Game of Thrones." The headlines around the deal have focused on whether Netflix or Paramount's David Ellison will win in the boardroom. But the results in your living room will be due to forces that are much bigger than the companies themselves, and have changed the way we watch. Movie theater releases are down, cable TV is dying, streaming prices are likely to rise, and Hollywood's power is waning in the age of tech giants. The reason companies like Netflix and Paramount want to buy Warner Bros. is because competition in the entertainment industry is fierce, driven by the decline of cable TV and the rising popularity of small screens and tech companies. "If Big Tech never made a move into media, there's a very good chance we wouldn't be seeing this much consolidation as we are now," said Brandon Katz, an entertainment analyst at Greenlight Analytics. Now that Americans spend more time with the big players in entertainment like Google-owned YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon, mergers can help legacy players like Disney, Fox, and Comcast compete. It'll mean lost jobs. The combo that formed WBD led to multiple rounds of layoffs, including about 1,000 roles in mid-2024. Both Paramount and Netflix present themselves as the bigger job savers, but both promise billions in "synergies" that will likely result in cuts. "The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is," said The Writers Guild of America, the union representing TV and film writers. Additionally, deals offer companies the opportunity to consolidate their brands. WBD has already combined HBO's prestige shows with Discovery's mainstream fare to form HBO Max, and Disney has brought Hulu and ESPN+ into its streaming bundle. It all trickles down to what you get to watch, where you watch it, and how much you have to pay. Streaming prices have been increasing while big theatrical movie releases have declined over time, and there's good reason to think those trends will continue, regardless of where Warner Bros. ends up. Industry trends for movie-going are clear, with the number of wide releases and box-office grosses still below their pre-COVID levels. Whoever ends up with Warner's HBO Max will likely bundle it with their existing streamer and raise the price based on the more expansive offering, Katz said. "Within 18 months, all consumers should expect to be paying more for these subscriptions," he said. It's also widely expected that the combination of two of these companies will lead to less output. That's one of the main objections of Hollywood, whose livelihood depends on stuff getting made. "This is one less entity writing checks," said Josh Rosenbaum, a producer at Waypoint Entertainment, whose credits have included Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar-winning "The Favourite." Paramount promised that if it wins the WBD battle, it'll release 30 movies a year in theaters, while Netflix says it'll continue to put Warner Bros. movies in theaters while favoring a quick-to-streaming strategy for its own films. The Disney and Fox merger is a cautionary tale; their combined theatrical releases have declined nearly 50% since the merger was announced in 2017. The dinosaurs may be fighting a losing battle. People (especially younger generations) are increasingly getting their entertainment from user-generated platforms. A Hub Entertainment Research survey found that people aged 13 to 24 spend an estimated 21% of their screen time watching non-professional videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compared to just 16% spent on traditional TV shows. In contrast, people aged 35 and up spend 39% of their screen time on TV shows — more than twice as much as they spend on online videos (14%). That's put pressure on traditional players. YouTube — not any traditional Hollywood powerhouse — is the No. 1 streaming service on TVs, according to Nielsen. Netflix's engagement per user has stagnated over the past few years, despite the company's increased spending on content, while YouTube has widened its lead on TV screens, according to Bernstein research. Netflix and other leading streamers have taken steps to bring social media-first creators and video podcasters onto their platforms, but show no signs of fundamentally changing their models. "The real threat to the media industry in general is the new formats like short form," Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Paramount is at least talking about a technology-led overhaul of how entertainment is made, which has investors intrigued. But whatever changes it makes are likely to be incremental in the near term, he said. Jump to

Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is a one-stop shop. Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is a one-stop shop. Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images Big Tech’s so-called Magnificent Seven are on everyone’s lips. The exorbitant stock market valuations of Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Tesla provoke an amalgam of awe and fear. Their trillion-dollar investments in AI prompt some to predict the brightest of futures and others to dread humanity’s dumbing down, unemployment, redundancy even. In this overwhelming din, it is easy to miss the larger picture: a new type of capital is killing markets, capitalism’s habitat. At its very beginning, capitalism was underpinned by faith in competitive markets. In the liberal fantasy, spearheaded by Adam Smith, bakers, brewers and butchers laboured within markets so cut-throat that none could make more money than the bare minimum necessary to keep their small, family-owned businesses running. This in turn provided us with our daily bread, ale and meat. Then came the second industrial revolution and the conglomerates whose market power would make Smith weep with joy. This was the era of Big Business and the “robber barons”. And so another — neoliberal — fantasy was created, to justify the new big beasts that were now monopolising almost every market that mattered. Joseph Schumpeter, a former Austrian finance minister who made America his home, was the new creed’s most effective advocate. Progress, he argued, is impossible in competitive markets. Growth needs monopolies to fuel it. How else can enough profit be earned to pay for expensive research and development, for new machines, new product lines and all the paraphernalia that helps innovation take root? To monopolise markets, conglomerates need to dazzle us with remarkable new products that kill off the competition, like Henry Ford’s Model-T or Apple’s iPhone. Should we worry about all that concentrated power? No, Schumpeter reassured us. Once they reach their pinnacle, these monopolies get flabby and complacent and, eventually, they’re brought down by some upstart: one example being Toyota’s toppling of General Motors. More recently, Peter Thiel, Palantir’s co-founder, said something that many thought was a restatement of Schumpeter’s dictum: “Competition is for losers!” While the pioneers of Big Business like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford would have agreed wholeheartedly, what Thiel was implying went beyond their wildest imagination. It went much further even than Schumpeter’s pseudo-Darwinian idea that progress comes through the rise and fall of monopolists in an endless struggle for existence. What Thiel was saying is that today, winners do not just kill off the competition to monopolise a market. No, they keep going until they kill the market itself and replace it with something quite different: a kind of cloud fief that lacks all of the ingredients of a proper market — indeed that lacks all of the advantages that liberals and neoliberals alike recognise in the machinery of decentralised markets. In fact, today’s winners —the Magnificent Seven, plus Thiel’s own Palantir — are reviving an economic model that all of us thought dead and buried after the fall of the Soviet Union: economic planning systems that match buyers and sellers outside anything that can be usefully described as a market. By Yanis Varoufakis Gosplan was the Soviet Union’s State Planning Committee, the engine room of its command economy. Its remit was to match the supply and demand of critical resources (oil, steel, cement) but also consumption goods (food, clothes, appliances), without using market prices. Once buyers and sellers were matched, prices were assigned with a view to achieving political and social objectives (such as to ensure basic affordability, or subsidise certain industries) — not to balance markets. Gosplan was disbanded immediately after the red flag was lowered over the Kremlin on Boxing Day of 1991, but it is now back. Where? In the algorithms powering Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, Peter Thiel’s Palantir and the rest of Big Tech’s digital platforms that pretend to be, but are not, markets. Before you protest the audacity of my claim, think of what happens when you visit Amazon. Unlike when you visit a shopping mall, either with friends or mingling with strangers, the moment you follow the link to amazon.com, you exit the marketplace and enter a space of pristine isolation. It’s just you and Jeff Bezos’s algorithm. You type, say, “espresso machines” into the search box and the algorithm matches you with a number of vendors. However, to achieve what it was coded for, the algorithm had started working months, even years, earlier. Over that period, you will have revealed to it many of your whims and desires through your searches, purchases, clicks and reviews. Using these cues, as well as data from other sources, the algorithm has trained you to train it to know you even better, enabling it to advise you on what books, music and films to buy. It has already won your trust. So, now that you are in a hurry to replace your broken espresso machine, the chances are that you will choose one of the top search results it has given you. The algorithm knows your spending pattern. It knows how to guide you to the espresso machine with the highest price you are prepared to pay, all in order that Amazon can collect up to 40% of it the moment you click the purchase button. It is an extortionate cut, but the espresso machine’s makers tolerate it, because they know that if they don’t, their company will never appear in the top search results of anyone prepared to pay for their product. As AI improves, this power to manipulate your behaviour increases — and this is why Big Tech’s valuations are going through the roof. This is nothing less than a capitalist, privately-owned, super high-tech reincarnation of the USSR’s Gosplan. Amazon’s software matches you with particular vendors and bans you from talking to any seller or even from observing what other buyers are doing — unless of course it calculates that it serves its own purposes to let you see a small selection of them. As for the price you pay, this follows (rather than precipitates) your being matched with a seller. Rather than being the variable that equilibrates demand with supply, prices in Amazon fulfil another role: that of maximising Jeff Bezos’s cloud rents. In this sense, prices in Amazon and other Big Tech platforms function in a manner far closer to Gosplan than to any farmers’ market, money market or shopping mall you have ever experienced. In fact, had the Soviet leaders lived to witness the workings of Silicon Valley’s Big Tech, they would be kicking themselves, lamenting that it was American capitalists who perfected their Gosplan model, complete with a surveillance system that would make their KGB henchmen green with envy. Gosplan failed to turn into a success story as it lacked Big Tech’s greatest weapon: cloud capital, that is, the algorithms, data centres and optic fibre cables working as an integrated network to train you to train it. As you impart your data, cloud capital learns how to input desires into your mind and then satiate these desires by selling you stuff within its privately owned version of Gosplan. But, is there really a difference — I hear many of you ask loudly — between Thomas Edison and Jeff Bezos? Are they not cut from the same cloth of megalomaniac monopolists seeking to dominate markets and our imagination? Yes, despite their similarities, there is a difference — and it is gigantic. Edison’s and Ford’s capital was productive. It produced cars, electricity, turbines. Bezos’s cloud capital produces nothing, except the enormous power to encase us in his cloud fief where traditional capitalist producers are squeezed for cloud rents and we, the users, provide our free labour. With every click, like and review, we enhance the power of cloud capital. Once upon a time, an old Trotskyite told me that the Soviet Union, in the name of socialism, had created a form of industrial feudalism. Independent of whether he was right or not, his comment is pertinent today in relation to Big Tech. Come to think of it, while the trading process on platforms like Amazon is reminiscent of the USSR’s Gosplan mechanism, it is also the case that the enormous sums that Amazon, Uber, Airbnb etc, charge the actual producers of the goods and services peddled on their sites are akin to the ground rents that the landed gentry used to charge their vassals — except that, here, they are cloud rents that accrue to the owners of cloud capital. So, just as the Soviet Union generated one kind of feudalism in the name of socialism and human emancipation, today, Silicon Valley is generating another kind of feudalism — technofeudalism, I have called it — in the name of capitalism and free markets. By Joel Day The parallel extends to the state. The USSR was meant to be a workers’ paradise in contrast to the USA whose raison d’être was to be a haven for capitalist producers. It turns out that both promises were false. As Big Tech’s cloud capital accumulates and concentrates into fewer and fewer hands, states are becoming dependent on corporate techlords. By outsourcing core functions — archives, health data, even military software — to rented cloud infrastructure, governments lease back their own operational capacity from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google. This dependency enables a new dimension of technofeudal power. From this perspective, just as the Soviet Union was a feudal-like industrial society pretending to be a workers’ state, the United States today is performing a splendid impersonation of a technofeudal state, with repercussions that extend to every realm of state activity, including health services, education, the tax office, our borders and faraway battlefields. In Ukraine and Gaza, and along our militarised borders, cloud capital is trained to extend its reach. Amazon’s AI tool Rekognition is used by law enforcement, including ICE, while Palantir’s vast surveillance software runs on Amazon’s cloud. Through Project Nimbus, Amazon and Google provide the Israeli military with advanced cloud and AI capabilities, reportedly enabling rapid, AI-driven targeting in Gaza with minimal human oversight. Let us briefly return to the comparison with the early 20th century’s original monopolist capitalists. Whether we admire or abhor the Magnificent Seven’s stock market valuations, it is helpful to keep this in mind: the old capitalist giants, the “robber barons”, actually produced things. The new technofeudal lords produce a new social order. They have replaced the invisible hand of the market with the visible, algorithmic fist of the cloudalist. Free-market enthusiasts have nothing to celebrate and much to regret. But it will take a brave soul amongst them to stare reality in the face. Just like pro-Soviet Marxists remained in denial that the Soviet experiment had failed for many years after 1991, so free-market ideologues refuse to see that capitalism begat a form of capital — cloud capital — that replaced markets with something out of the Soviet past. In the process, it has killed capitalism. Yanis Varoufakis is an economist and former Greek Minister of Finance. He is the author of several best-selling books, most recently Technofeudalism: What killed capitalism.

Title: Pay cuts, poaching, and pivoting: Inside Scale AI after Meta
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/pay-cuts-poaching-pivoting-inside-scale-ai-meta-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:11:01Z
Full Content:
This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim. "Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months," ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. "Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over." The contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb. The chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele. The vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Activity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider. Joe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. "This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig. The company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal. Some investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point. Other investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. "It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him," he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back. On another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation. If the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a "zombie" after being invested in by a tech giant. This summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go. Osborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is. Those weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields. Osborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce. Meanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation. Mercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies. One Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.) Brendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. "Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality," Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at "record highs." It's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. "Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business," she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September. Scale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. "We take data security seriously," Osborne said. "We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems." Sloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being "suspected spammers," "cheaters," with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like "Good and Bad Folks" and "suspicious non-US taskers." Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been. The company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out. Charles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:10:00Z
Full Content:
December 10, 2025 04:10 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Nematicides Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Global Nematicides Market, valued at USD 1.87 Billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.51% to reach USD 3.05 Billion by 2030. Nematicides are chemical or biological agents developed to control plant-parasitic nematodes that severely damage crops by attacking root systems. Market growth is strongly driven by the need to reduce crop losses and increase food security as global demand rises. Key Market Drivers: The persistent global challenge of declining arable land: Declining arable land worldwide significantly increases reliance on nematicides to maximize productivity from existing farmland. With global population growth and limited land resources, protecting yields becomes essential. FAOSTAT Analytical Brief 107 reported in June 2025 that cropland per capita decreased by about 20%, from 0.24 to 0.19 hectares between 2001 and 2023, intensifying the need for nematicides to prevent nematode-related yield losses. Simultaneously, rising consumer demand for organic and sustainably produced food is reshaping the market, accelerating the shift toward bio-based nematicides. According to IFOAM and FiBL's 2025 yearbook, global organic farmland grew by 2.5 million hectares in 2023, reaching nearly 99 million hectares. This growth supports the adoption of biological nematicides. The broader pesticide and agricultural chemicals market, including nematicides, is projected to grow from USD 102.9 billion in 2023 to USD 169.8 billion by 2028, as reported by Infosys in its 2024 Agri-chem Industry Outlook. Key Market Challenges: Stringent regulatory frameworks and increasing environmental concerns regarding the residual effects of certain synthetic nematicides: Strict regulations and rising environmental concerns surrounding synthetic nematicides significantly hinder market growth. Rigorous testing, lengthy approval processes, and compliance requirements increase development costs and extend timelines, reducing incentives to invest in new chemical active ingredients. According to CropLife Australia (2024), developing a new crop protection chemical now exceeds USD 300 million and typically requires more than 12 years due to extensive environmental and toxicology data requirements. Regulatory withdrawals also limit farmers' access to critical active ingredients. CropLife Africa Middle East (2023) reported that maize pest control tools could face a 75% reduction and coffee pest tools a 58% reduction in Kenya due to EU-driven restrictions. These challenges constrain product portfolios and restrict overall market growth. Key Market Trends: The integration of precision agriculture technologies into nematicide application: Precision agriculture is increasingly shaping nematicide use by enabling more efficient, targeted application through GPS-guided systems, remote sensing, and variable-rate technologies. These tools reduce waste, improve application accuracy, and enhance crop health while minimizing environmental impact. According to the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (January 2025), Variable Rate Technology adoption in the U.S. increased by 69% across major commodity crops, reflecting the growing reliance on data-driven input management. Strategic collaborations across agrochemical companies, biotech firms, and research institutions are also accelerating innovation in advanced nematicide solutions, particularly biological products. For example, Bayer and Kimitec's June 2025 launch of Ambition Complete Gen2 and Ambition Secure Gen2 demonstrates how alliances expedite the development of next-generation biological nematicides and broaden market offerings.

Title: AI is driving a workforce transformation

Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:00:00Z

Getty Images The rapid influx of AI in its various forms is inevitably leading to workforce transformation. What is less clear is exactly how the transformation will play out. AI is a factor in several recent layoffs at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other companies. However, there's evidence that while AI may affect jobs that require manual or routine labor, it will also spur job growth and productivity gains. There appears to be little doubt AI will be an integral part of workers' lives going forward. According to research presented at the Gartner IT Symposium in October, a survey of CIOs by Gartner indicates that by 2030, they expect 0% of IT work will be done by humans without AI, 75% will be done by humans augmented with AI and 25% will be done by AI alone. TechTarget spoke with Graig Paglieri, CEO of Randstad Digital, about the changing nature of the workforce. Randstad Digital, a division of the Netherlands-based global staffing company Randstad, focuses on providing workers to meet the digital transformation needs of enterprises. The firm operates across four vertical areas -- customer experience, cloud and infrastructure, data and analytics, and product engineering. Paglieri discusses how the AI transformation is affecting jobs and some of the characteristics of the Gen Z generation that's currently entering the workforce. Editor's note: The following transcript was edited for length and clarity. How do you view the current workforce transformation? For example, Gartner research indicates that 0% of work will be done without AI help by 2030, and 25% will be done by AI agents alone. Graig Paglieri: I agree with those proportions and ratios. We're already seeing it significantly in developer roles. It's not that they're completely going away and being replaced by agents, but instead of a company needing four or five developers, they need one or two. There's definitely that augmented agent support. The shift toward components of tech modernization that can be outsourced to an agent is the roadmap. There's evidence that many jobs will be lost to AI, but we also hear that AI will create other jobs. What are you seeing? Paglieri: There's going to be both. There are going to be jobs that are lost, and there will be challenges around upskilling and repurposing some roles. But companies that are ahead of the game are going to transform the way they operate with AI in mind. For example, internally, our recruiting function has been tech-enabled for many years, but with agentic AI and the move to more platform capabilities, the recruiter role will shift. We're not going to need recruiters trying to find people on a job board, source them, match them and see if they're available. All of that can be done through AI technology. But can [the recruiters] do a better job of advising the talent that's been identified on the right role? Can they manage their onboarding? Can they help redeploy them to their next assignment? Those are a lot of the services and functions that get lost today because so much time is spent on the front end dealing with manual, fragmented and cumbersome processes. A significant aspect of the transformation involves Gen Z workers entering the workforce. What are some characteristics of how these workers are being integrated into the workforce? Paglieri: Recent Randstad Digital research shows a small percentage of them -- under 5% -- plan to spend more than 10 years in their company. This can make it challenging, particularly in professional services where it's a big commitment both for the organization and the employee to become productive. They're not recognizing that this is going to take multiple years in phases to develop the skills and capabilities to advance rather than just moving on to the next thing. Flexibility ties into that, too. Forty-five percent of the people we polled said flexibility was the most important factor. Compensation's there, but there's this idea that they're not going to be bogged down by geography and working in the office. Having different, flexible hours is way more important than in past generations. The AI-focused workforce transformation seems to be having a greater effect on entry-level positions. How does the incoming workforce generation deal with that, and how do companies deal with the experience gaps that this will likely produce? Paglieri: This is where the importance of softer skills might come in -- the ability to differentiate and distinguish yourself. The human aspect of your value is more valuable than someone else, where maybe being more technically proficient in the past isn't quite as critical. But it's also where flexibility comes in as well -- taking internships, recognizing that you're not necessarily going to go right into what you thought was your desired field. Are you being flexible enough in finding ways into the workforce? But companies also have to continue to change their expectations and how they're bringing in and onboarding talent, and recognize that there's a need to have balance based on this disruption that's with us. Where is AI affecting the job market now, as some jobs that were hot a few years ago may be going away? What jobs are needed now? Paglieri: First, the economy and market conditions are adding to the dilemma that we're in, so it's not just AI. That has this compounding effect -- AI is creating some disruption and uncertainty, and the macro environment is as weird and wacky as it's ever been. Where is it going? There's a ton of work that needs to be done -- for digital transformation in particular. We're going to see roles such as project managers and business analysts -- which may have slowed down a little bit now because of that AI uncertainty -- pick back up as these engagements need to move faster. That human-in-the-loop with technology role is still critical. Having a foundation in AI skills and some other technical skills is important. What's your overall feeling about the job market in the next few years? Optimism or pessimism? Paglieri: It's definitely optimism. We're in the later stages of the first chapter [of the AI transformation], which starts with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. It also applies to tech services in general. There's been lots of growth, but now there's been a little bit of plateauing. There's still so much digital transformation work that needs to be done that 2026 is going to have a lot more growth opportunity than we've seen in 2025 -- and certainly [more than we] saw in 2024. We're starting to see some early signs of that, and 2027 and 2028 are going to be more productive and positive than 2026.

Title: An AI bubble burst? Early warning signs and how to prepare
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/An-AI-bubble-burst-Early-warning-signs-and-how-to-prepare
Time Published: 2025-12-10T06:00:00Z

KOHb - Getty Images The impending end of an AI bubble could signal a fresh start for some AI technology companies. AI technology has captured the attention of consumers and investors alike due to its rapid innovation and potential for profit, resulting in a surge of AI tools flooding the market. But, despite a wave of innovation, few initiatives made it past the development phase. This was because they were built on fragmented tools and were too disconnected from business goals, according to Juan Jose Lopez Murphy, head of data science at Globant. The situation made some investors uncomfortable. "The frustration we experience, which some call deflation, is fatigue from too many models and too little strategy," Lopez Murphy said. "Instead of investors and executives pulling back completely, we are starting to see a shift of focus from volume to value." Investors are now looking for projects that deliver measurable outcomes that are sustainable across teams and systems, resulting in a more disciplined market, he said. The big difference between what's happening now and previous investment bubbles is that AI technology is real in terms of actual value that it brings, said Matt Hasan, PhD and CEO of aiRESULTS Inc. As an AI strategist and an economist, Hasan said he looks at the market through two lenses -- the technology and the money chasing it. Unrealistic expectations have led to overinvestment in generative AI, and according to an MIT report, 95% of organizations are experiencing zero return. Investment is currently outpacing value. "The risk comes from how fast investors have piled in," Hasan said. "Money is flowing into data centers, chips and startups a lot faster than real adoption can keep up. The hype is moving ahead of actual business value." Three critical factors differentiate this bubble from others, according to Jonathan Bittner, CEO of Dimensional Analytics. Those ways include the following: Forrester predicted an AI market correction in 2026 as organizations grapple with the ever-widening gap between inflated vendor promises and actual value delivered. With fewer than one-third of decision-makers able to tie the value of AI to their organization's financial growth, CEOs will rely on CFOs to approve AI investments based on ROI in 2026, according to the report. "In 2026, the AI hype period ends as the pressure to deliver real, measurable results from secure AI initiative intensifies," Sharyn Leaver, chief research officer at Forrester, said in a report. "As the era of volatility continues, tech and security leaders will be called upon to recalibrate investments under tighter financial scrutiny and governance while navigating increasingly complex geopolitical and economic risks." Hasan has seen some deflation as venture funding cools off, valuations level out and companies realize that promised gains are taking longer to show up. "That's not collapse -- that's a pause to catch our breath," Hasan said. More red flags are visible if you look deeper, Bittner said, including the following: A bubble burst won't kill AI, just the unrealistic expectations surrounding it, Hasan said. He believes that companies focused on solving real problems will emerge stronger. Bittner shares Hasan's optimistic outlook. He said the burst itself would hit organizations in three waves, including the following: "The AI bubble burst could mark the beginning of a healthier, more focused innovation cycle for AI. Enterprises may start consolidating budgets for projects or slow down hypothetical projects," Lopez Murphy said. "This period doesn't mean that innovation is stopping altogether but rather showing maturity in prioritizing projects." He believes that emphasis will shift to building frameworks that will last in the long term. As the threat of an AI bubble burst looms closer, industry leaders will have to see through the hype and focus on AI technology that solves tangible business problems. Hasan advises leaders to stay grounded, tie AI projects to clear results and track costs. "If businesses keep their heads and focus on real impact, a correction won't be a disaster. It'll be a reset, and a healthy one," he said. Bittner added his own recommendations, including the following: For Hasan and Bittner a bubble burst would signal a new, more efficient approach to AI technology investments. "The bubble pop won't be a disaster. It will be a reset. And America's hard-working, smart people will use that reset to revolutionize the economy with AI -- the right way," Bittner said. "It will always be about the people. Not the algorithms." Julie Hanson is a freelance writer who has reported on local news across Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Title: Investors Brace for Revelations in New AI Bellwether Oracle’s Latest Report
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/investors-await-new-ai-bellwether-oracles-latest-report/

Deals with Meta, Nvidia and Softbank underscore concerns that Oracle is overexposed to a possible AI bubble. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com When tech giant Oracle, a linchpin of the artificial intelligence boom, reports quarterly earnings today, investors expect it to live up to its name — which in antiquity referred to a medium providing insight into the unknown. The unknown being where AI, an increasingly agita-prone trade, is heading in 2026. For decades following its 1977 founding, Oracle was known for enterprise software: In a 1993 cover story, Fortune dubbed chairman Larry Ellison “software’s other billionaire” after Microsoft’s Bill Gates, featuring him in a full-cut suit with peak lapels that screamed industry titan of the late 20th century. This year, Oracle vaulted to the forefront of the new century by pivoting to data centers and cloud infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom. Its share price, up 33% in 2025, made Ellison the world’s wealthiest man for a brief stint. But a certain calculus worries some investors. In September, Oracle announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI that would see the ChatGPT-maker buy computing power over five years starting in 2027. Building out the capacity to provide that power, however, requires piling up more debt than can fit in a full-cut early ’90s power suit. After the deal was announced, Oracle raised $18 billion from a bond sale and now carries over $100 billion in debt. Deals with Meta, Nvidia and Softbank underscore concerns that Oracle is overexposed to the AI bubble. Those worries have manifested in two ways. First, as of Tuesday’s close, Oracle’s share price is down 32% from its record September high. Second, options traders piled into the company’s credit-default swaps in recent months as the price to guard against Oracle defaulting on its debt tripled (no one expects that to happen, but if AI bubble fears push the swaps up more, those traders could profit). Which sets the stage for today’s earnings, now considered a test of the market’s confidence in the AI trade. Many analysts think the worst fears are overblown: An Assist from Altman: Evercore advised investors to exercise “some patience as turning sentiment will take time,” adding that OpenAI could lend a helping hand if, as expected, it soon puts out an updated version of its chatbot that rivals or surpasses Google’s latest Gemini release. The Chinese government has discouraged companies and government-funded data centers from buying Nvidia’s chips. Some user-generated Sora videos will also make their way onto Disney+, and ChatGPT will become available to Disney employees. SpaceX’s potential monster IPO would come after what’s been a remarkable rebound year for public listings. Morgan Stanley cut its rating of Tesla for the first time in two years on Monday to “equal weight,” which is equivalent to a hold. A handful of high-profile defamation-by-AI-chatbot allegations against big tech firms are already stacking up. You might recall that in 2021, Zuckerberg deemed the metaverse so vital to the future he renamed the entire company after it. In memo this week, Altman promised the release of a new reasoning model next week that bests Google’s Gemini. Anduril was last valued at $30 billion in June, when its $2.5 billion fundraising round was oversubscribed eight times. The success of indie titles may help video game makers rely less on blockbusters and widen creative license, creating a 1UP for players. Artificial intelligence can do a lot of things. Getting us on an exercise bike doesn’t appear to be one of them. Gemini was trained on Google’s in-house chips, which look like a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Nvidia’s cutting-edge products. Wall Street’s smart money is starting to take out some short positions on the AI trade, albeit mostly around the industry’s fringes. © 2025 The Daily Upside

December 09, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it is expediting a dedicated Electron mission for the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and is scheduling the launch from Launch Complex 1 in less than 24 hours’ time. The mission, named ‘Bridging The Swarm’, is scheduled to launch no earlier than Thursday, December 11 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The mission now precedes the upcoming launch for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). This launch rescheduling is a demonstration of Rocket Lab’s operational efficiency, responsiveness, and flexibility to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers, while continuing to launch more missions every year to support a growing manifest. ‘Bridging The Swarm’ will be Electron’s 19th launch of the year, closely followed by the ‘RAISE and Shine’ mission for JAXA. With these missions Rocket Lab well exceeds the Company’s 2024 launch tally of 16 missions. Upcoming Electron Launch Schedule Mission name: Bridging The SwarmLaunch Window Open: 1:45 pm NZDT, December 11 (00:45 UTC)Customer: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)Launch Site: Launch Complex 1, New Zealand Mission name: RAISE and ShineLaunch Window Open: no earlier than 4:00 pm NZDT, December 13 (03:00 UTC)Customer: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)Launch Site: Launch Complex 1, New Zealand About ‘Bridging The Swarm’‘Bridging The Swarm’ is a dedicated launch for the Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The mission will deploy NEONSAT-1A, an advanced Earth observation satellite equipped with a high-resolution optical camera to monitor natural disasters along the Korean Peninsula. NEONSAT-1A is a sub-satellite of KAIST’s NEONSAT satellites, which altogether will form two orbital planes of a constellation in a sun-synchronous orbit. The first of the NEONSAT satellites, NEONSAT-1, was launched and deployed by Rocket Lab during the April 2024 mission ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’, and has been successfully carrying out its Earth-monitoring objective. The new NEONSAT-1A satellite will be deployed to validate KAIST’s advanced satellite’s capability, boost operational utility, and pave the way for the single NEONSAT satellite to become a constellation – thus fulfilling the mission’s name, “Bridging the Swarm”. More NEONSAT satellites are scheduled for launch in 2026 and 2027. The NEONSAT program is a collaboration across multiple Korean academic, industry, and research institutions: SaTReC, which is leading the system architecture design and engineering; the Satrec Initiative(SI), a satellite manufacturer that has successfully developed a number of remote sensing satellites for low Earth orbit; and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), which is managing the mission’s ground segments for the NEONSAT program. The NEONSAT program is funded by the Korean government’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) and is supervised by Korea AeroSpace Administration (KASA), a newly established agency overseeing the development of aerospace technology and preparing for space-related hazards in the Republic of Korea. About ‘RAISE and Shine’:This mission will deploy JAXA’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft, a single satellite that will demonstrate eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. “RAISE And Shine” is the first of two dedicated launches for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. The second dedicated launch on Electron for the program is scheduled take place from Q1 2026. The missions are Rocket Lab’s first dedicated Electron launches directly contracted with JAXA, emphasizing Electron’s importance to reliable global space access for both domestic and allied international space agencies.
