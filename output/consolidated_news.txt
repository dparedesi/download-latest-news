Far from being another tight arm wrestle, a strong Clontarf selection made something of a statement when ending the five-match winning run of leaders Ballynahinch at Ballymacarn Park with a 32-12 bonus-point win. By contrast, there was again late drama aplenty in the other four Division 1A games, which were decided by margins of four points or fewer. Storm Darragh’s slipstream ensured the wind was a significant factor throughout Saturday’s AIL programme, which almost survived intact. Clontarf laid the foundations into the first-half wind to lead 3-0 at half-time before maximising the elements. Tadgh Bird, whose move from fullback has helped to fill the Matt D’Arcy midfield void, crashed over for ‘Tarf’s first try before Conor Kelly scored off his own chip. Ballynahinch, missing some of their Ulster contingent, responded with Ethan Graham’s try before Aitzol King’s intercept try and after another for the hosts by Ronan McCusker, Bird took his seasonal tally to six when scoring for the fourth game running to clinch the bonus point. Newly promoted St Mary’s went top with a hard-earned 26-24 win over Young Munster at Templeville Road. St Mary’s led 12-0 through tries by Tom O’Reilly and Myles Carey, before tries by Manuel Covella, Shane O’Leary and Oisín Pepper, the latter with a fine chip and chase, put Munster 17-12 ahead only for Michael Silvester’s try to leave the home side 19-17 ahead at the break. Munster led through Covella’s second try before Dan Goggin finished off a multiphase attack against his old club and Conor Hayes, another ex-Munster man, landed the winning conversion from the touchline in the swirling wind. Terenure remain fourth after playing a get-out-of-jail card at a blowy Bowl. They led 21-17 when Conor Phillips’ intercept try augmented first-half scores by Craig Adams and Alan Bennie but UCD, stacked with eight Leinster academy players, looked likely winners after Conor Ó Tighearnaigh’s bonus-point try put them 24-21 ahead. Levi Vaughan made inroads off an overthrow before Chris Cosgrave levelled with a wind-assisted penalty from inside halfway and after the restart went out on the full, Harrison Brewer’s charge up the middle was deliberately knocked on for Cosgrave to land the winning penalty with the game’s last kick. Con remain fifth after a hard-earned 19-17 win away to a game Garryowen side with a number of Munster academy players. Two Brian Gleeson tries and a Dylan Hicks penalty had Garryowen 17-14 in front but Con, who had scored first-half tries through Scott Buckley, after three successive penalties off lineout mauls, and a well-worked try by the recalled Matthew Bowen, won courtesy of a late penalty try from another catch-and-drive. It was awarded by American referee Lee Wiener, who had earlier sinbinned two Con players for high hits. Similarly, both sides played better into the wind at the Palace Grounds, where Lansdowne prevailed by 19-15 over City of Armagh thanks to Andy Marks’ sixth try of the season, a timely fillip before hosting leaders on the Aviva back pitch next Friday night. Men’s Division 1A: Garryowen 17 Cork Constitution 19; Ballynahinch 12 Clontarf 32; City of Armagh 15 Lansdowne 19; St. Mary’s College 26 Young Munster 24; UCD 24 Terenure College 27.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. It seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military. READ NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss. The companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne. According to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI’s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to “assess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm’s way”, revealed a former OpenAI employee. “OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values… Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.” Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide “US intelligence and defense agencies” access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times’ Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year. These strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a “fierce competitor”. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn’t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn’t have access to OpenAI’s “information rights,” like the company’s roadmap and other materials. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fortified its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal artificial intelligence system. On December 6, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gearing up to launch one of its most-awaited projects: the series of cellular modem chips that aim to replace components from long-time partner and rival Qualcomm. Reportedly, Apple’s in-house modem system will debut next spring. This technology is said to be part of the iPhone SE, the company’s entry-level smartphone. The iPhone SE will be updated next year for the first time since 2022. When the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it is going to have new features such as Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. However, the breakthrough is going to be its in-house modem, code-named Sinope. Currently, the modem won’t be used in Apple’s higher-end products but is set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23. Apple’s entry-level iPads will also witness the chip debut as early as 2025. Overall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The collaboration integrates open-source defense and security intelligence data into IBM’s Watsonx, a trusted AI and data platform. Defense leaders will be able to access high-quality data combined with trusted AI, improving their decision-making abilities. This will be done by integrating IBM Watsonx AI and data platform, utilizing an IBM Granite model with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with Janes data. In turn, the RAG pattern will allow operational decision support, and assistance in military and intelligence analysts by generating comprehensive, data-augmented reports for situational analysis and decision-making.

The "primary use case for bitcoin seems to be a store of value aka 'digital gold' in a decentralized finance (DeFi) world; speculative interest seems to have played a prominent role in the growth of digital tokens thus far," the report authors wrote. Last month, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump nominated Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager known for his pro-bitcoin and crypto stance, to be the next secretary of the Treasury. In July, Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. "I think that everything is on the table with bitcoin," Bessent said following Trump's bitcoin reserve proposal. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin was comparable to gold during the New York Times' DealBook conference. "It’s just like gold only it’s virtual," Powell said. "People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold."

Here are key ETH price targets options traders are eyeing in December 2024 and January 2025. Last week, the U.S. spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs hit their largest weekly inflows since launch. According to SpotOnChain data, the products logged five consecutive days of inflows totaling $844 million. Over the same period, the highest daily inflows hit $428.5 million, led by BlackRock and Fidelity. The strong flows and demand fueled ETH value to hit $4K for the first time since March 2024. Source: SpotOnChain The remarkable performance was a complete turnaround from the products’ lackluster launch in July. How far can the strong inflows boost ETH value? Source: Deribit Options traders weren’t surprised by the $4K hit last week. They had expected it, with nearly $660M in notional value betting on ETH hitting that level. So, what are they eyeing next? According to Deribit data, other price targets with high OI (open interest) rates were $4.5K, $5K, and $6K. Significant bets were also placed on the $8K level. About $374 million was being placed on a $5K target. The $6K and $4.5K saw $353M and $348.5M worth of notional value on call options (bullish bets), respectively. In short, options traders were confident that ETH would reach $5K and $6K price targets. For December, $4.5K and $5K were reachable, but the $6K milestone was expected from January 2025. Rising market interest, as shown by a spike in ETH’s active addresses, also supported the options market’s bullish outlook. Source: CryptoQuant Since October lows, ETH’s monthly active addresses have increased from below 300K to over 380K as of this writing. If the bullish market sentiment continues, the increased market interest could increase ETH prices. Read Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025 That said, ETH consolidated below $4K at press time. On the price charts, the next key Fib levels marched the options traders’ targets. The $4.5K and $5K were immediate upside levels, while $3.6K was a key support.

Title: Ethereum Surge Coming? Analyst Eyes $16,000 Milestone Within 2 Years

Ethereum (ETH) continues to spark bullish talk in the cryptoverse, as well known analysts see large price moves ahead. According to Venture Founder, Ethereum is forming a rising three-year triangle pattern, which could set the stage for a possible breakout. Based on similar comparisons to data from 2016-2017, the altcoin will hit $15,937, probably by May of 2025. Such a rise would take Ethereum’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion, a historic first for the blockchain behemoth. Analysts view a weekly close above $3,800 as a significant milestone. From there, Ethereum might aim for its all-time high of $4,878 before moving on to higher grounds. But is the market prepared for this upswing? This $ETH breakout out of the triangle consolidation is very significant. Now #Ethereum only has to close this weekly candle bullish, and we may never revisit this sub $4,000 level again in this bull cycle. The impulse move from 2016-2017 is repeating. PT: $15,937 by May 2025 pic.twitter.com/dNzcO3mPe1 — venturefounder (@venturefounder) December 6, 2024 More institutions are becoming interested in Ethereum, which makes people more optimistic about its long-term prospects. Spot Bitcoin ETFs got a lot of attention at the beginning of the year, and now Ethereum-based funds are following suit. Notably, since the middle of November, spot Ether ETFs have gotten more than $1.3 billion in fresh inflows. The iShares Ethereum Trust from BlackRock has made the most returns, $500 million in just one week. Beyond just numbers, these investments show a rising trust in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to analysts, this institutional funding flow will pave the way for ETH’s anticipated meteoric rise. With institutional investors continuing to pour money into the cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s value proposition as a long-term investment appears stronger than ever. The recent weeks’ price behavior of Ethereum has also been rather favorable. Following a little setback, the altcoin has recovered, climbing 30% starting in November 18. With analysts underlining its resilience against market swings, it is trading at $3,686 right now, which is a solid figure. Technical markers of consolidation point to ETH getting ready for its next action. Moving averages show stability, hence the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays neutral. Forecasts show ETH perhaps rising by 43% in six months and 22% in three months, data from CoinCheckup shows. The signals point favorably even though Ethereum’s route to reach $15,937 is undetermined. With favorable technical conditions, institutional inflows, and strong ecosystem development, the altcoin is primed for major increases.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Following the Federal Reserve adopting a more optimistic stance and Bitcoin hitting a historic $100,000 milestone, this week carries a handful of key earnings reports, inflation data, and some events that could set the tone for 2025. By week’s end, many will shift their focus to holiday celebrations, but for now, investors are keeping a watchful eye on developments in the stock market, eager to gauge how these signals might influence the trajectory of the markets heading into the new year. This week brings a few important earnings. On Monday, Oracle (ORCL-0.45%) Corporation will release its earnings after the closing bell, offering insights into the demand for corporate tech services. On Tuesday, GameStop (GME+2.08%) will take the spotlight with its earnings report, which is also scheduled for after the market close. Wednesday shifts focus to Adobe (ADBE-0.31%), which will reveal its financials at the end of the trading day. Thursday rounds out the week with a series of significant earnings announcements. AI giant Broadcom (AVGO-1.17%) will report its performance, offering clues about the health of the semiconductor and AI-driven technology markets. Retail powerhouse Costco (COST-0.97%) will also release its results, shedding light on consumer spending habits amid shifting economic conditions. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors, as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the market will receive initial jobless claims data, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Finally, on Friday, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will be released. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth. Microsoft (MSFT+0.71%) will determine on Tuesday whether to invest in Bitcoin, although the board has recommended voting against the proposal, citing that the company already considers a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. The AI Summit kicks off in New York on Wednesday, bringing together industry leaders and innovators for two days of exploration into how artificial intelligence is transforming lives and reshaping various sectors. The event will feature keynote speakers from major tech giants such as Google (GOOGL+0.76%) and Meta (META-2.16%).

Title: What is high bandwidth memory and why is the US trying to block China’s access to it? | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. The US government has imposed fresh export controls on the sale of high tech memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications to China. The rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones. Here’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI. High bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory). HBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Most importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN. The latest set of export restrictions, announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge. As retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment. Experts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron (MU), it is developing its own capabilities in the area. “What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.” In China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency. What makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips. Because AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches. Larger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on. Think of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate. “It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway. You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson. Currently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM. As of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a research note published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%. As for Micron, the company aims to grow its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron. The high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is expected to account for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year. Imagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM. On the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip. That is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging. “Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu. In addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise. “You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: FPIs return to Indian equities with ₹24,454 crore inflow in December first week

This was in sharp contrast to their net outflows of ₹21,612 crore in November 2024 and massive net withdrawal of ₹94,017 crore recorded in October 2024. Prior to the latest turnaround, FPIs had remained net sellers for eight consecutive weeks. In September, FPIs had bought Indian equities worth ₹57,724 crore. The robust buying was prompted by BJP-led combine making a strong comeback in Maharashtra and US equity benchmarks clocking new all time highs. Taking the latest robust December inflows into account, FPIs have so far this calendar year pumped in ₹9,435 crore in India as compared to net outflows of ₹15,019 crore at the end of November, depositories data showed. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said that FPIs turning buyers in early December, in total reversal of their sustained selling strategy during the last two months, has altered the market sentiments. “In December, through 6th, FPIs have turned buyers having bought equity for ₹17,921 crores through exchanges. Including the purchases through the primary market, the total FPIs buying through December 6th stood at ₹24,453 crores”, he said. This is a clear change in FPI strategy in India. “It can be argued that the stage of relentless FPI selling is over”, Vijayakumar added. Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said “Looking ahead, the flow of foreign investments into Indian equity markets will hinge on several key factors. These include the policies implemented under Donald Trump’s presidency, the prevailing inflation and interest rate environment, and the evolving geopolitical landscape”. Additionally, the third-quarter earnings performance of Indian companies and the country’s progress on the economic growth front will play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment and influencing foreign inflows, he said. Srivastava said there could be few probable reasons for this sharp u-turn by FPIs towards Indian equities in December after selling around $14 billion between October and November. The recent correction in the market could have prompted them to build some exposure. Uncertainty over Chinese equities on the back of proposed tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump on China and other several nations could have prompted FPIs to look back at Indian equities which offers a much clearer long term growth prospects, despite relatively high valuations, he said. Additionally, FPIs might have decided to rejig their portfolios a bit towards India given suboptimal GDP number would have fanned hopes that RBI might soon have to start cutting rates to boost the economy, which in turn might boost the equity markets. For the uninitiated, in its recent monetary policy review on December 6, 2024, RBI had cut CRR by 50 bps to 4 per cent, while keeping repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, he noted.

Title: » A Conversation with Andrew Plotkin The Digital Antiquarian
URL: https://www.filfre.net/2024/12/a-conversation-with-andrew-plotkin/
Time Published: 2024-12-08T05:47:01Z

For some of you, Andrew Plotkin will need no introduction. The rest of you ought to know that he’s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he’s written an even dozen fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from 1995’s A Change in the Weather, the co-winner of the very first IF Competition, to his 2014 Kickstarter-funded epic Hadean Lands. While he was about it, he made vital technical contributions to interactive fiction as well; perhaps most notably, he invented a new virtual machine called Glulx, which finally allowed games written with the Inform programming language to burst beyond the boundaries of Infocom’s old Z-Machine, while the accompanying Glk input-output library allowed then to make use of graphics, sound, and modern typography. Over the last ten years or so, Andrew — or “Zarf,” as his friends who know him just a little bit better than I do generally call him — has moved into more of an organizing role in the interactive-fiction community, taking steps to place it on a firm footing so that its most important institutions can outlive old-timers like him and me. Andrew was kind enough to sit down with me recently for a wide-ranging conversation that started with his formative years as an Infocom superfan in the 1980s, went on to encompass some of his seminal games and other contributions of the 1990s and beyond, and wound up in the here and now. I hope you’ll enjoy reading this transcript of our discussion as much as I enjoyed chatting with Andrew screen to screen. He’s refreshingly honest about the sweet and the bitter of being a digital creator working mostly in niche forms. One final note before we get started: Andrew is currently available for contract or full-time employment. If you have need of an experienced programmer, systems architect, writer, and/or game designer whose body of work speaks for itself, you can contact him through his website. The munchkin Zarf, 1971. Perhaps we should start with some very general background. Have you lived in the Boston area your whole life? No, not at all! I only moved to Boston in 2005. I was born in 1970 in Syracuse, New York, a place that I don’t remember at all because my family moved to New Jersey when I was about three. We lived there for a couple of years, then my father got a job in the Washington, D.C., area. I went to primary school through high school there. And when and where did you first encounter interactive fiction? It must have been around 1979. My father’s company had a “bring your family to work” day. A teletype there was running Adventure. My father plunked me down in front of it and explained what was going on. I thought it was the best thing in the universe. I banged on it for a couple of hours while everybody else was running around the office, although I didn’t get very far. For the next few months, Dad was playing it at work, illicitly — that was how everybody played it. He would bring home these giant sheets of fan-fold printer paper showing his latest progress. As I recall, I suggested the solution to the troll-bridge puzzle: giving the golden eggs to the troll. That was great, the first adventure-game puzzle I solved. When did you first get a computer at home? Around 1980, we got an Apple II Plus. We acquired the first three Scott Adams games and Zork, which was newly available, plus Microsoft’s port of Adventure to the Apple II. Andrew’s bar mitzvah cake took the form of an Apple II. That started my lifelong attachment to Infocom. I played all the games as they came out. I begged my folks to buy them for me. Later, I spent my own money on them. You played all of the Infocom games upon their first release? Pretty much, up until I went off to college. I remember that I did not play Plundered Hearts when it came out. That one was a hard sell for a lot of young men — although it’s a brilliant game. Yeah. I didn’t play it because I was a seventeen-year-old boy. I also didn’t play Zork Zero or the [illustrated] games that came after it because I had gone off to college and didn’t have the Apple II anymore. But I did catch up with all of them a few years later. You mention that you did get some adventure games from other companies when you first got the Apple II. Did that continue, or were you exclusively loyal to Infocom? Well, I was haunting the download BBSes and snarfing any pirated game I could. I played Wizardry and Ultima. I didn’t play too many other text adventures. I knew they existed — I had seen ads for Mike Berlyn’s pre-Infocom stuff — but I didn’t really hunt them down because I knew that Infocom was actually better at it. I remember that we had The Wizard and the Princess, which was just clunky and weird and not actually solvable. I know that you also wrote some of your own text adventures on the Apple II in BASIC, as a lot of people were doing at this time. Yes. The first one I did was a parody of Enchanter. I called it Enchanter II. It was a joke game that I could upload to the BBSes: “Look, it’s the sequel!” It was very silly. It started out pretending to be an Infocom game, then started throwing in Doctor Who jokes. The closing line was, “You may have lost, but we have gained,” the ending from the Apple II Prisoner game. It was terrible. But I did write it and release it. Unfortunately, as far as I know it’s lost. I’ve never seen it archived anywhere. I did Inhumane after that. That was another parody game, but it was meant to have actual puzzles. It was inspired by the Grimtooth’s Traps role-playing books. I liked the idea of people dying in funny ways. Inhumane is obviously juvenilia, but at the same time it shows some of what was to come in your games. There’s a subversive angle to it: here’s a game full of traps where the objective is to hit all the traps. That’s the way I play a lot of games, but inadvertently. Here that’s the point. Were you heavily into tabletop RPGs? No. Tabletop role-playing I was never into. I get performance anxiety when I’m asked to come up with stories on the fly. I just don’t enjoy sitting at a table and being in that position. It’s not my thing. But I was interested in role-playing scenarios and source books. First, because of the long-term connection to [computer] adventure games, second because they had so much creative world-building and storytelling, just to read. So, yeah. I was interested in tabletop role-playing games but not in actually playing them. A surprising number of people have told me the same: they never played tabletop RPGs much but they liked the source books. For some people, the imagination that goes into those is enough, it seems. So, you go off to university. Why did you choose Carnegie Mellon University? I got rejected by MIT! It was second on the list. Were you aware that Infocom was connected so closely to MIT? No. I knew that they were in Cambridge because I subscribed to the Status Line newsletter. There was a running theme of them mentioning stuff around Cambridge. And I’d played The Lurking Horror. But I didn’t have the full context of “these were MIT students who made Zork at MIT.” I guess it would have made the rejection even more painful if you’d known. At university, you’re exposed to Unix and the Mac for the first time. Yes. And to the Internet. And I started learning “real” programming languages like C. Did you also play games at university? Yes. I ran into roguelikes for the first time. Which ones did you play? I played a fair bit of Advanced Rogue, but I never got good at it. There were people playing NetHack, but it was clear that that was a game where you had to put in a lot of time to make any serious progress. Rogue was a little bit lighter. Yeah. I never was willing to put in the hours and hours that it takes to get good at those games. Now especially, when I write about so many games, I just don’t have the time to devote 200 hours to NetHack. You’ve since re-implemented one of your own programming experiments from university, Praser 5. That was not originally a parser-based text adventure. It was a puzzle stuck inside the CMU filesystem. Every “room” was a directory, connected by symlinks. You literally CDed into the directory and typed “ls,” and the description would pop up in the file listing. Then you would type, “cd up,” “cd left,” whatever, to follow symlinks to other directories. It was an experiment in using the tools of a shared computer system to make an embedded game. The riddles were a matter of running a small executable which was linked in each directory. I used file permissions to give people access to more things as they solved more puzzles. Much later, after I had learned Inform 6, I did the parser version. What did you do right after university? I graduated in 1992, but I wanted to stick around the Pittsburgh area because a lot of my friends hadn’t graduated yet. I got a job in the CMU computer-science department and shacked up with a couple of classmates in a rundown apartment. That was great. I bought my first Macintosh and started writing stuff on it. That’s when I started working on System’s Twilight. I figured it was time for me to get into my games career. I decided to write a game and release it as shareware to make actual money. So, I bought a tremendous number of Macintosh programming manuals, which I still have. System’s Twilight has the fingerprints of Cliff Johnson of Fool’s Errand fame all over it. Yes. It was an homage. When did you first play his games? Was that at university? Yeah. Those came out between 1988 and 1992, when I was there. I had a campus job, so I could afford a couple of games. I played them on the campus Macintoshes. I remember very well being in one of the computer clusters at two in the morning, solving the final meta-puzzle of The Fool’s Errand. I had written down all of the clues the game had fed me on papers that were spread out all over the desk. Every time I used one of the clues, I’d grab the piece of paper, crumple it up, and throw it over my shoulder. When I finished, the desk was empty and I was surrounded by paper. We had an amazing experience with The Fool’s Errand as well. My wife fell in love with it. It was our obsession for two weeks. When I talked to Cliff Johnson years ago, my wife told me to tell him that he was the only man other than me that she could see herself marrying. I wasn’t sure how to take that. What were your expectations for System’s Twilight? I intended to make some money. I didn’t know how much would show up or whether it would lead to more things. It was just something I could do that would be a lot more fun than the programming I was doing in my day job. Now that you had your own Macintosh and a steady income, I guess you started buying more commercial games again? I know you have a huge love for Myst, which came out around this time. I was actually a little bit late to Myst. I didn’t play it until 1994, when everybody was already talking about it. But when you did, it was love at first sight? Yeah. The combination of the environment and the soundscape was great and the puzzles were fun. It felt like someone was finally doing the graphical adventure right. I’d never gotten into the LucasArts and Sierra versions of graphical adventures because they were sort of parodic, and the environments weren’t actually attractive. They were very pixelated. They just weren’t trying to be immersive. But Myst was doing it right. As long as we’re on the subject: I guess Riven absolutely blew your mind? Yes, it did. It was vastly larger and more interesting and more cohesively thought-through than Myst had been. I played it obsessively and solved it and was very happy. At what point did you get involved with the people who would wind up being the founders of a post-Infocom interactive-fiction community? In 1993 or 1994, someone pointed me to an open-source Infocom interpreter. I hadn’t really been aware of the technology stack behind Infocom’s games. But now you could pull all of the games off of the Lost Treasures disks and run them on Unix machines. That was kind of interesting. I don’t remember how I encountered the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup. But when I did, people were talking about reverse-engineering the Infocom technology. I wrote an interpreter of my own for [Unix] X Windows that had proportional fonts, command-line editing, command history, scroll bars — all the stuff we take for granted nowadays. I released that, then ported it to the Macintosh. That was my first major interaction with rec.arts.int-fiction. It must have been around this time that Kevin Wilson made a very historically significant post on Usenet, announcing the very first IF Competition. You submitted A Change in the Weather and won the Inform category. Did you write that game specifically for the Comp? Let me back up a little bit. In early 1995, I got an offer from a game company in Washington, D.C, called Magnet Interactive, to port games from 3DO to Macintosh. So, I moved to Washington — I was very sad to leave Pittsburgh behind — and rented a terrible little rundown apartment there. I was also making some money from System’s Twilight, and had started working on a sequel, which was to be called Moondials. It was a slog. I had some ideas for puzzles, but the story was just not coming together. So, when Kevin Wilson said, “Hey, let’s do this thing,” I said, “I’m going to take a break from Moondials and write a text adventure very fast.” The process started with downloading Inform 5 and the manual and reading it. I think I blasted through the manual five times in a week. The start of the Competition was a little weird because we didn’t yet have the idea of all of the games being made available at the same time. Kevin just said, “Upload your games to the IF Archive.” So, all of the games trickled in at different times. For the second Comp, we settled very firmly on the idea of all games being released at the same time because the 1995 experience was not very satisfactory. I know that it’s always frustrating to be asked where ideas come from. But sometimes it’s unavoidable, so I’m going to ask it about A Change in the Weather. I think I was drawing on the general sense of being an introvert and not making friends easily — being separated from people and feeling alienated from my social group. My college experience wasn’t solidly that. I was an introvert, but I was at a computer college, and there were a lot of introverts and introvert-centered social groups. I had friends, had housemates after college, as I said. But I still struggled somewhat with social activities. It was a failure mode I was always aware of, that I might end up on the edge not really talking to people. I drew on that experience in general in creating the scenario of A Change in the Weather. That’s interesting. From my outsider perspective, I can see that much more in So Far, your next game. It really dwells on this theme of alienation and connection, or the lack thereof. That also strikes me as the game of yours that’s most overtly influenced by Myst. Just from the nature of the environment and the magical-mechanical puzzles. It’s not deserted like Myst, but you can’t interact in any meaningful way with the people who are there — which goes back to this theme of alienation. I wasn’t thinking of Myst specifically there, but it was part of my background by that point. The direct emotional line in So Far was breaking up with my college girlfriend. That was a couple of years in the past by this point. That had been in Pittsburgh. A lot of the energy for working on System’s Twilight came from suddenly being stuck at home after that relationship ended. I channeled my frustrations into programming. But then I tried to drop it into So Far as a theme of people being separated. None of the specifics of what had happened were relevant to the game — just the feeling. By the time of So Far, you were as big as names get in modern interactive fiction. Your next game Lists and Lists was arguably not a game at all. What made you decide to write a LISP tutorial as interactive fiction? Do you have a special relationship with LISP? Yes! I hate it! I had taken functional-programming courses in college and learned LISP. But I just did not jibe with it at all. That’s ironic because Infocom’s programming language ZIL was heavily based on LISP. Right. It was an MIT thing, but it was not my thing. Nevertheless, the concept of building it into the Z-Machine with a practical limit of 64 K of RAM — or really less than that — seemed doable. And I had written a LISP interpreter as a programming exercise during my first or second year in college. So, I was aware of the basics. Doing it in Inform wasn’t a gigantic challenge, just a certain amount of work. Were you already starting to feel restless with the traditional paradigm of interactive fiction? Right after Lists and Lists, you released The Space Under the Window, which might almost work better if it was implemented in hypertext. It’s almost interactive poetry. I wasn’t bored with traditional games, but I did want to try different things and see what could be done. And writing in Inform was simple enough that I could just whip out an idea and see whether it worked. That was inspiring the whole community at this point. That was the lesson of the first IF Comp: you can just sit down and try an idea, and a month later people will be talking about it. There was a very rapid fermentation cycle. Yes. It led to much more formal experimentation. Before the Comp came along, everybody was trying to follow the Infocom model and make big games. But if you have an idea that’s more conceptual or avant garde, it’s often better suited to a smaller game. The Comp created a space for that. If you do something and submit it to the Comp, even if it’s highly experimental, it will get played and noticed and discussed. Now we come to The Big One of your games in many people’s eyes. And I must admit that this applies to me as well. Spider and Web is such a brilliantly conceived game. I’m in awe of this game. So, thank you for that. You’re welcome. It’s always tricky to have a game which is so purely built out of a single idea because then, when you try to write another game, you think you have to come up with another idea that’s as good, and it’s never possible. Was this idea born out of any particular experience, perhaps with other media? I don’t think it was. I was prying into what we would now call the triangle of identities — prying into the idea that what the game’s text is telling you is a point of view that might have biases behind it. There is a dialog between what the player thinks about the world and what the game thinks about the world, and there can be cracks in between. That led to the idea of using the storytelling of the game to tell a lie, and that there is a truth behind it which can be discerned. I started with that kernel and started coming up with puzzle scenarios. Here is an outcome that is verifiable. But there’s two different versions of what happened that could have led to that outcome. I’m going to tell one, but the other is going to be the truth. I strung together a few different versions of that. Then I said, okay, if we’re lying, then the introduction of the game has to introduce the lie. So I folded that in from the start. I knew that I wanted a two-part structure: you learn what’s going on, then you make use of all of the information. The moment of transition between the two is often referred to as simply The Puzzle. It’s been called the best single text-adventure puzzle ever created. Did you realize how special it was at the time? No. I figured it would be a puzzle. I didn’t understand how much of an impact it would have. I knew that I wanted to surprise players by having a possibility suddenly become available. Here’s a thing that I can do, and I will do it. Any kind of good puzzle solution is a surprise when you think of it. Afterward it seems obvious. I knew I had a good combination of elements to make it work, but I wasn’t thinking about the way that it would reorient the entire history of the game in the player’s head in one fell swoop. I don’t know. Maybe I had an inkling. What I love is that the game is called Spider and Web. Suddenly when you solve that puzzle, those two categories get reversed. Who is really the spider and who is caught in the web? The reason I called it Spider and Web was actually the old idiom “What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.” The notion of deception was meant to be part of the title, and the spider was there just to go with the web. But yes, it’s multi-valent. I know you’re a big reader of science fiction and fantasy. I wouldn’t picture you reading a James Bond novel. What made you decide to go in the direction of spy fiction here? Honestly, I thought of it as science fiction. The spy fiction was merely because the story was about deception, and somebody had to be fooling somebody. But conceptually, I had it pinned as a science-fiction scenario from some kind of dystopian cold war, but with magically advanced technology. You entered Hunter, in Darkness into the 1999 IF Comp. It’s a riff on Hunt the Wumpus, which is about the most minimalist imaginable text adventure, if you can even call it that. Your game, by contrast, is a lushly atmospheric, viscerally horrifying fiction. Were you just being cheeky? Yeah, I was. I just wanted to put in all the stuff that Wumpus didn’t have, without getting away from the core concept. I thought it would be a funny thing to do. I worked really hard on the claustrophobia and the creepy bats. I remember crawling under a chair to try to get the feel of being in a narrow passage and not being able to move around — just to get the bodily sense of that. Then we have Shade from 2000, which is another of my favorites of your games. Even more than Hunter, in Darkness, it has a horror vibe. Yes. I leaned into it harder in Shade. There are all kinds of opinions about what is really going on in Shade. I know you like to let people draw their own conclusions about your games, so I won’t press you on that… I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on the main point, that you’re dying and this is all a hallucination. Yeah, that was absolutely my take on it, that you’re dying of thirst in the desert. I saw it pointed out in a review that everything you’re trying to do is the opposite of the real problem you have. You’re trying to get out of your apartment in the hallucination, but your real problem is that you are out, lost in the desert. Was that something you were consciously doing, or are we all reading too much into it? Well, neither. I don’t think I was consciously thinking that way, but that doesn’t mean that you’re reading stuff into it. It’s deliberately ambiguous. I had a lot of images in my head that I threw out at random. I did have the notion that this environment in your apartment was from your past. You really had packed up your apartment and called a taxi and gotten out, and reiterating it was… inappropriate but real. It was in your head while you were having this terrible experience, and it was being replayed by your brain in a broken way. You’re in a place of blinding light — it’s very hot — and the experience you’re replaying is very dim and dark, except that when light occurs it’s painful. A rare 1999 meeting in the flesh of interactive-fiction luminaries. From left: Andrew Plotkin, Chris Klimas, David Dyte, and Adam Cadre. Although your games of the 1990s are fondly remembered and still played, you were also making major technical contributions. Probably most important was the Glulx — sorry, I can’t say that word! — virtual machine to let Inform games expand beyond the strictures of Infocom’s old Z-Machine. How did that come about? No one knows how to pronounce it! I started to think about it in probably 1996, when Graham [Nelson] came out with version 7 and 8 of the Z-Machine. Version 8 was big — big enough for Graham’s Jigsaw — but it was still just a stopgap. It was only twice as big as Infocom’s version 5. There were all kinds of things that didn’t scale. It seemed worthwhile to make a fresh design that would be 32-bit from the start. I just didn’t want to deal with more incremental changes. And being able to jettison all of the weird legacy stuff about the Z-Machine seemed like a win too — being able to rethink all of these decisions in a technological context that is not 1979. One of the things I wanted to do was to separate out the input-output layer. I had already written Z-Machine interpreters for X Windows and Mac that used Mark Howell’s ZIP engine with different interface front-ends. When TADS went open-source around 1997, I made an interpreter for that. So, now I had this matrix, right? I’ve got an X Windows front-end and a Mac front-end, and they both slap onto the Z-Machine and the TADS virtual machine. In a pretty clear way, these things are just plug and play. All the virtual machine does is accept text input and generate text output. I mean, yes, there’s the status line, maybe sound and graphics, but fundamentally that’s what it’s doing. And the front-end presents that text in a way that suits the platform on which it’s running. I was doing the same thing that Infocom did, just slicing it into more layers. Infocom had an interpreter and a game file. I said, we’re going to have an interpreter engine and an interpreter front-end. Thus there will be more flexibility. I designed the front-end first, the Glk library. I made an implementation for Mac and for X Windows and for the Unix command line. Then I started thinking about the virtual machine. I ripped apart the Inform 6 compiler so it could compile to Glulx from the same game source code. As I recall, the Glulx virtual machine is bigger than the Z-Machine — for all practical purposes, its capacity is infinite — but also simpler. There’s less of the hard-coded stuff that Infocom included, like the object tables. Yes, exactly. I figured the more generic and simple I could make it, the better. It would be simpler to design and simpler to implement. It adds complexity to the compiler, but the compiler already needs code to generate object tables in a specific format. It would still be doing that, but there wouldn’t be any hardware support for them. I’d just have to include veneer routines to handle object tables in this format. Then, if we ever need to change the format, no problem. We just change the compiler. We don’t need to change the virtual machine. When did you publish the Glulx specification? April 1, 1999. Were you still living in Washington, D.C., at this time? I had moved around a lot, actually. The job in D.C. only lasted about a year and a half. After the porting project I had been doing finished up, the company dropped me onto a project to do a Highlander licensed game, which we had absolutely no concept of how to do. This would have been like a 3D action game. That project got canned. Then I worked for a document company in Maryland for a while. Then I moved back to Pittsburgh and worked for a startup. The startup got acquired by Red Hat, and they moved us down to North Carolina. That was from like 1999 to 2000. Then Red Hat fired us and I moved back to Pittsburgh. From 2000 to 2005 I worked for a filesystem company in Pittsburgh. You took a break from writing interactive fiction for a few years after Shade. Then there was a little bit of a shift in focus when you did come back in 2004 with The Dreamhold. Your earlier games don’t try too hard to be accessible. When you returned, you seemed more interested in outreach and accessibility. What was the thought process there? Only the obvious one. It’s true that all of my previous games were written very much for the community. They were written for people who knew how IF worked. But The Dreamhold was specifically an outreach game. I wanted to try to expand the community. We’d been doing this for about ten years at that point, and it was kind of the same crowd of people. I thought to create an outreach game as a total wild-ass experiment to try to bring in people from other parts of the gaming world. I didn’t know whether it would work, but I figured it was worth a try. So I designed a game specifically for that purpose, built around explaining how traditional interactive fiction worked to people who didn’t know how to play it. That meant doing some wacky stuff. There are some rooms in The Dreamhold that you enter by going north, but to go back you have to go east, because I figured, this is really uncomfortable, but people are going to run into this if they get into IF, so they should be familiar with the concept. I’ll try to introduce it as smoothly as possible by putting messages like, “The corridor turns as you head to the north.” Then put in the [room] description, “You can go back the way you came, toward the east,” to try to make it more tangible. But I wanted to introduce complicated maps and darkness and all of the hardcore stuff that the community was used to. And also make it fun. There were a number of these outreach efforts at the time. Some people were taking IF games to more conventional game jams. There were cheat sheets of “how to play IF” going around. My impression is that these efforts weren’t super successful. Is that your impression as well? Yes, it is. None of it actually worked. It’s great that we made the on-ramps and it’s good that we still maintain them, but there was not a huge influx of new people coming onto the scene at that point. My impression is that the community didn’t really start to grow until it opened itself up to non-parser-driven games: the Twine games and ChoiceScript games and so on. Presumably some percentage of those players became willing to try the parser games as well. Yeah, but that was a little bit later, after 2010 or so. There was still a gap. I decided, well, The Dreamhold didn’t make an impact, so I’m just going to go back to writing wacky puzzle games. Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. I would say that drew people into creating games, because it was much more approachable for people who were not C programmers. There was a bit of a revolution there. It was just harder to see because it was new authors rather than new players. The time around 2010 was an exciting one for you personally as well as the community. In addition to the ongoing buzz about Inform 7, Jason Scott released his Get Lamp documentary, and you launched a Kickstarter to make a game called Hadean Lands soon after. Yes. In 2010, Jason Scott premiered Get Lamp at PAX East. He had interviewed me two or three years earlier — probably in 2007. Yeah, he worked on that movie for almost ten years. Exactly. It’s kind of funny to look back at 2007 and see me talking about releasing commercial interactive fiction. But in 2010, all of the old Infocom guys showed up at PAX East. I was on that panel, sitting with Dave Lebling, Brian Moriarty, and Steve Meretzky. I was going… [genuflecting] PAX East, 2010. From left: Dave Lebling, Don Woods, Brian Moriarty, Andrew Plotkin, Nick Montfort, Steve Meretzky, and Jason Scott. (Photo by Eric Havir.) I’m not worthy! Exactly. Jason Scott brought Get Lamp to a game class at Tufts University a few weeks later. Since I was living about half a mile away, I came in and said, “Hi, I’m in this movie.” Afterward, I went up to Jason and said, “You know, people are talking about interactive fiction for the first time in fifteen years outside of our little community. Do you think I should do a Kickstarter for a giant IF game?” And Jason looks at me like I’ve got bananas growing out of my ears and says, “Yes, you should!” He’s the most enthusiastic person in the world. Yes. And of course, he’d just done a Kickstarter for the Get Lamp release. This was early for Kickstarter. There had been gaming Kickstarter projects before, but no really gigantic ones. So, getting $30,000 for an IF Kickstarter was kind of a big deal in 2010. So I went to the boss at my day job and said, “Well, I guess this is it for us. I’m quitting.” I knew that $30,000 wasn’t actually going to last me very long, living in Boston. But of course, I’d been in the software industry for decades by this point, so I had a fair amount of savings cushion built up. And I had a pile of Red Hat stock which was worth some money. I could live on it while I found my footing as an indie developer. The Dreamhold had taken me nine months. I thought Hadean Lands would take me a year. Ha! It turned out that writer’s block is a hell of a thing. Hadean Lands kept getting sidelined. I got totally knocked over by the idea of doing a hypertext MUD. I spent a year writing that. That was Seltani, which was hugely popular for about two months in the Myst fan community; I did it as a Myst fan game and presented it at a Myst convention. Everybody loved it. But I wasn’t writing Hadean Lands, and eventually my KickStarter backers started to get upset about that. I did slog through it. I got Hadean Lands done [in 2014]. I don’t feel like the story is hugely successful, but I’m very happy with the puzzle structure and the game layout. As you know as well as I do, there’s a whole checkered history of people trying to monetize IF. A few years ago, Bob Bates of Infocom and Legend fame released Thaumistry. I was a beta-tester on that game. The game was very good, but these things just never work. It’s always a disappointment in the end. Nobody has ever cracked that code. If you look at the Thaumistry Kickstarter and the Hadean Lands Kickstarter, you see that they made almost the same amount of money from almost the same number of backers. It’s the same crowd showing up: “Yeah, we still love ya!” But they’re not enough to make a living from… The problem is getting outside of that crowd. It’s no wonder that people like Emily Short have long since decamped, saying, “I have to work on different kinds of games with a larger reach.” What about you? Do you think you will ever return to parser-based interactive fiction? That’s a fair question. I’ve had a lot of starts toward things that I thought might be interesting. I started working on a framework for a kind of text game that’s not parser-based but also not hypertext in the sense that Twine is. It’s more combinatoric. I got two-thirds of the way done with building the engine and one-third of the way done with writing a game, then I kind of lost it. But I still think it’s interesting and I might go back to it. I don’t think it would go big the way Twine did, but it might reach a different audience. It’s a different way of thinking about the game structure. Would you care to talk about your partnership with Jason Shiga to turn his interactive comic books into digital apps? I have played Meanwhile, the first of those. Sure. I’d been aware of Jason Shiga ever since I started hanging out with Nick Montfort at MIT after I moved to Boston. Nick had a bunch of his early self-published stuff. He had the original printing of Meanwhile, as a black-and-white hand-cut book. I thought it was really neat. Totally by coincidence, Meanwhile got picked up by a publisher just before that 2010 PAX East we talked about. A nice big hardback version of it was published. It was being sold at PAX East. I thought, man, this is great, I’d really love to do an iPhone version. This was 2010; iPhone games were big. A little later, I did the Hadean Lands Kickstarter and quit my job. I needed to have more projects than just one text adventure, so I wrote to Jason Shiga and said, “Hey, I’m a big fan. I’d love to do an app version of your book.” Jason was amenable, so we had the usual conversations with lawyers and agents and signed a contract. I worked on that at the same time that I was planning out Hadean Lands. The iPhone app came out in 2011. So, the finances of making a go of it as an independent creator of digital content without a day job didn’t quite pan out for you in the end. I feel your pain, believe me. It’s a hard row to hoe. What came next? After Meanwhile and Hadean Lands, I felt very stuck. Jason [Shiga] was off working on non-interactive comics, so there wasn’t anything to do there. I bummed around for a while trying to find something that would make any kind of money at all, but I was not successful. I’m skipping over huge chunks of time here, but in 2017 Emily Short and Aaron Reed were working on a project to do NPC dialog as a commercial product. It was essentially taking Emily’s old ideas about threaded dialog in parser games and turning them into a plugin which game designers could use in any game to have interesting multi-threaded conversations. I spent a couple of years working on that project with them. But it turned out that management at that company sucked and everybody bailed. Since then until this year, I’ve been working for big and small games studios, working on the dialog parts of their games. Coding dialog engines or writing dialog? I’ve been a software engineer, working on the coding part, but working with the writers. Also during this period, Jason Shiga started writing what he calls “Adventuregame Comics,” which are shorter Meanwhile-style books. I’ve started porting those. The Steam port of The Beyond and the iOS and Steam port of Leviathan are available now. The iOS port of The Beyond will be coming later. Since Hadean Lands, you’ve stepped into more of an organizing role in the IF community. Yes. I’m very proud to have transitioned from being a hotshot game writer to someone who is doing community support, building structures and traditions and conferences. I never wanted to be a person who was only famous for writing games, especially after I started writing fewer games. I really didn’t want to be a person who was famous for having been a big game writer in the 1990s. That’s a sucky position to be stuck in. There needs to be a second act. It’s maybe a maturation process as well. When you get a little bit older, you realize that some things are important in a way you may not have when you were a young, hotshot game writer. Yeah. I slowed down writing games because I started to second-guess myself too much. When you’ve written a lot of games that people got really excited about… Then you’re competing with your own back catalog. It doesn’t feel good. I’ve had trouble getting away from that. You’ve done most of your organizational work in the context of the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, so maybe we should talk about that more specifically. I’ll give you my impression of the reasons for its founding, and you can tell me if I’m right. You and some other people decided it would be wise to institutionalize things a little bit more, so that the community is no longer so dependent on individuals who come and go. With a foundation and a funding model and all of these institutional aspects, hopefully you set up the community for the long haul, so that it can survive if a server goes down or someone goes away. Yeah, that’s exactly where it started. We’d been running for decades on people just setting up a server somewhere and saying, “Hey, I’ll run this thing!” That was the original IF Archive, the Usenet newsgroups, IF Comp, the Interactive Fiction Database, the IF Forum. It was workable, but everything was being paid out of somebody’s pocket. There wasn’t a lot of discussion about who was doing what or how much it cost. There was no fallback plan and no thinking about what would come next if somebody stopped doing something. Like, there was a long period when IFDB wasn’t getting any updates because Mike Roberts had a day job. Some things about it were clunky and hard to use, but you couldn’t fix them. So, in 2015 or early 2016, Jason McIntosh, who was running the IF Comp at that point, had a conversation with somebody who said, “Why don’t you have a non-profit organization to support the IF Comp? Then you could get donations from people.” And Jason started running around in circles with a gleam in his eye, saying, “Yes! We should do this! We should do this! Whom do I know who can help?” He started talking to other people who were longtime supporters of things in the community. That included Chris Klimas, who had been supporting Twine for three or four years, and me — I’d been supporting the IF Archive for a while. Then Carolyn VanEseltine and Flourish Klink joined. Flourish was the only one who knew how to set up a non-profit. They had run a Harry Potter fan conference as a teenager, and, being excited and not knowing things were hard, had just done it. We got into contact with the same lawyer Flourish had used. The lawyer told us what we needed: forms, bylaws, etc. Jason was the first president, I was the first treasurer. We went down to my bank and opened a business account for the organization. Then we wrote to the IRS to become a 501 C3 non-profit. We set up a website, found someone to give us a basic Web design and a logo. Then we announced it. At the start, we just did the IF Comp; we collected about $8000 that first year for a prize pool. But over the course of the first couple of years, we added Twine and the IF Archive. The IF Forum was the next big addition. Then the IF Wiki and IFDB. Today each has its own steering group. And we have a grants committee now. The NarraScope conference is another IFTF project. Would you like to tell a bit about that? That was my idea. I’d always been keen on the idea of having a narrative-game-oriented conference. I’d been going to GDC for many years. GDC has a sub-track, a narrative-game summit, which is where people like Emily Short and Jon Ingold hang out. But it’s a very tiny slice of what GDC is. And of course GDC is expensive, so it’s hard to bring in the hobbyists and the indie people and the people who write IF Comp games. They just can’t afford GDC. I wanted to provide an alternative that was more approachable and affordable and friendly. Once we as an organization had steady members and contributors and could bring in money, I said, “It’s time to think about a conference. Our first de novo project.” So, I talked to people I knew who had been involved in conferences, like the Myst fan conference, which is a very tiny thing that happens every year, like 100 people. But it’s been going for years and years. And of course Flourish had run a fan conference. In 2017 or 2018, I went to GDC with a bunch of business cards that said, “We want to run an interactive-fiction, adventure, and narrative-oriented game conference. Want to help us?” I handed one to everybody I talked to. I found a bunch of people who were interested in helping. Nick Montfort said he could get us a space at MIT for the event relatively cheap. We put up a call for speakers, a website, etc. We were coordinating with the IFTF Education Committee, which is run by Judith Pintar, who goes all the way back to Shades of Gray. Yeah, I had a great talk with Judith some years ago now. I had strong opinions about how a friendly conference should feel. We had to bring in lunch so people would sit around and have conversations rather than splitting up and running all over Cambridge. I wanted long breaks between talks so people would have space to socially interact. I wanted badges that didn’t distinguish between speakers and attendees; we’re all here, and we’re not going to have superstars. I wanted an open and honest tone. We made sure to have a keynote speaker who wasn’t an old fart. We didn’t want somebody like Scott Adams coming in and talking about what it was like back in the 1980s. You didn’t want to become a retro-gaming conference. Right. And we deliberately made the scope larger than just interactive fiction as found in the IF Comp or the IFDB. We didn’t want to limit the conference to those topics. We kept the admission price down to about $85. That was 2019. We had about 250 people, and everything miraculously went perfectly. The worst disaster was when the Dunkin’ Donuts guy was dropping off coffee and hot cocoa. One of the urns blew its spout and dumped gallons of cocoa all over the floor. Someone said, “I know where there’s a mop,” and went and got the mop and cleaned it up. Great, let’s have the rest of the conference! Local game companies made contributions, maybe $500 or $1000. Between that and the registration fees, the conference broke even. I admit that I threw in $2000 myself to make it balance, but that was because we splurged out and rented a bar on Sunday night. I said, okay, I’ll cover that, so that everybody can go out and have pizza and beer. A dream achieved: Andrew closes the 2019 NarraScope conference in Boston. Time for pizza and beer! It was a huge success. We said we would do it again next year. But of course next year was 2020. You know how that story goes. But it was exciting enough that we wanted to keep going anyway, so we had an online event in 2020. We skipped 2021, then came back in 2022 with an online conference. Then we had a hybrid model for 2023 in Pittsburgh and 2024 in Rochester. And that’s the history of the thing in a nutshell. By now I’ve become just an advisor, which is a great relief. How many people have attended the later conferences? It’s very easy to attend an online conference, so about 500 or 600 people signed up for those. But in person in Pittsburgh, there were about 100, either because people didn’t want to travel in the pandemic era or because we were offering an online option, so a lot of people who could have showed up decided to stay home and watch the stream instead. This year was a little higher, like 120. You were at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester this year? Yeah. The space was spread out, which turned out to be a win, because we had to walk through the museum and walk past all the cool exhibits. People were jumping out between talks to explore the museum. It was a really neat space — but unfortunately more expensive than a university. And there will be another conference in 2025? There absolutely will. It’s going to be in Philadelphia at Drexel University. NarraScope has not yet become big enough to replace GDC, but we’re optimistic. [smile] I don’t think you want that. It becomes very bureaucratic and soulless. Yeah, obviously. But Justin Bortnick, who is the current IFTF president, has been talking to GDC about booth space to present IFTF on the show floor. The Video Game History Foundation had a booth there this year. We thought, we’re educational too! We could do that! It may actually happen. Maybe we can wind up this conversation by talking about the current status of the IF community itself. For many years, it seemed to be quite stagnant in terms of numbers. We already talked about the outreach efforts that took place around 2005 and largely did not succeed. But about five years later, the hypertext systems started to come online. There was a big jump at that point. If you look at the number of games entered in the Comp, they actually trend down through the 2000s, then suddenly there’s a big spike around 2010 to 2012. They’ve stayed at quite a high level since then. Do you have a sense of whether these new, presumably younger people are jumping over to the parser-based stuff as well? There are new faces on both sides. There is now an active group of retro-fans interested in parser games. That is, people who are excited about making new games and running them on Commodore 64s and the like. We had to update Inform to fix the support for the version 3 Z-Machine, which had been broken over time as everybody was writing bigger and bigger games. Now people want to write small games again. And there is more interest in hybrid systems, intermediate models which are neither pure hypertext nor pure parser. For years and years, there were no new parser tools. I thought the last great parser development systems had already been implemented; people would stick with TADS 3 and Inform 7 forever. Then a parser system called Dialog appeared, which is a little bit different from them. But there is certainly more energy on the hypertext side, especially because a lot of us old farts have drifted away. I’m not writing games anymore, Emily Short isn’t writing text games anymore, Jon Ingold and Aaron Reed went off and did their things, Adam Cadre went off to work on film scripts. There are new people writing new games, but I think the pool is going to shrink over time. But that’s okay. Everything that Jon Ingold has done at Inkle Studios is informed by the early text games he worked on and how he wanted to expand that to reach a bigger audience. Everything Sam Barlow has done — Her Story, Telling L!es, Immortality — is informed by his experience writing text games. The same goes for Emily Short. It’s still part of the conversation. It’s just not the center of it anymore. Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. And there’s still theater. Yeah. Trends in interactive media, just the same as others forms of entertainment and art, come and go. They have their time, and then their time is over. I’m quite at peace with that. I’m sort of handicapped by the fact that I haven’t played IF Comp games in quite a while. I haven’t either. To be honest, I’ve played almost nothing made in the last ten years, just because I have so many old games on the syllabus for this site. Having too many games to play is not the worst problem to have, but it’s made me kind of a time traveler. I live in the past in that sense. I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. Ryan Veeder is younger than us. I do look at the Comp website sometimes to see what’s going on. I’ve noticed that it still seems to be a parser-based game that actually wins the thing most of the time. That’s a sign of something, I guess. Yeah. Maybe it’s a sign of old farts hanging on too long? But seriously, I think there is a new generation of parser-game authors. Whether it’s big enough to sustain itself after you and I are doddering in a nursing home, I don’t know. There’s been so much progress with computer understanding of natural language. A lot of it is associated with large language models, of course, which is a fraught subject in itself. But I could imagine a system — a front-end — that could take natural language and translate that into something a traditional parser could more readily understand, then funnel it through even an old text adventure. I’m kind of surprised I haven’t heard of anything like that. Someone did do that as an experiment and posted about it on the forum. Experimenting both with using LLMs on the input side to translate natural language into parserese, and also on the output side to translate generic room descriptions into more flowery, expanded text. I’m more interested in the input side because I like hand-crafted output, but that’s getting into the whole question of AI. Yes, I have no interest whatsoever in reading AI-generated text in any context. I think there wasn’t a lot of uptake on that idea just because the kind of people who are excited about AI aren’t excited about parser games in the first place. There have been several attempts to make an AI-generated text adventure, but they’ve all been by people who were not good at text adventures and didn’t know what they wanted out of it. There’s AI Dungeon, which uses an LLM to pretend to be a parser game. But because it’s all AI generated, it doesn’t really produce anything interesting. The people who are interested in making parser games are mostly old-fashioned artisans who want to hand-craft everything and are not motivated to dive into AI as a shiny new pool. It might be different if someone who was an established parser-game author jumped in and wholeheartedly tried to make it happen. Revolutions are the result of one person getting involved and building something that takes off. Someone has to actually do the work. And to this point, nobody has done that. It’s very possible the whole AI thing will collapse in six months anyway. I think that’s a very good possibility, but I think that if it does, it will leave behind some pieces in the rubble that are actually useful. Maybe a solution to our parsing problems can be one of them. But I’ve kept you long enough. Thanks so much for the talk! Thank you! Did you enjoy this article? If so, please think about pitching in to help me make many more like it. You can pledge any amount you like.

I should say, the cake was the work of my mother, Diane. Full credit there. It was tasty. :) Disco Godfather December 7, 2024 at 5:42 pm Just wanted to comment that cake looked awesome. Moms making birthday cakes is something I miss from that era! Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 5:39 pm As soon as I read that Andrew worked for a startup that got acquired by Red Hat, I thought of “Being Andrew Plotkin”, which I played, many years after its release. For some reason, when I played the game, I assumed that it was set at Red Hat simply because that was a company with some nerdy “cool factor” in 2000. Of course, I should have figured that the author would know where Andrew worked and write the game accordingly. It sucks that Red Hat fired Andrew’s team. Andrew Plotkin December 6, 2024 at 5:52 pm Oh, I couldn’t move back to Pittsburgh fast enough. The Raleigh/Durham area was _not_ my home base. (Although, as it happened, Stephen Granade was living in Durham. So we got to hang out for that year.) Anyhow, the pile of Red Hat stock was excellent compensation for my trouble. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 5:44 pm >Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. Oof. But I don’t disagree, necessarily. We did have radio plays finally come back to life with podcasts, but I still don’t know what will do it with parser fiction. Maybe if a super-famous streamer gets into text adventures. The most prominent streamer I know who is a regular parser player is BillBull (did Gnome Ranger recently) but he’s at the level of 100-150 viewers, not the thousands. I do have two current projects which are text-game adjacent but in the non-disclosure phase, unfortunately. However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. I can’t even imagine trying to sell a parser game now, except for maybe getting the Infocom collection from Microsoft and giving it the same treatment Atari and Llamasoft got from Digital Eclipse. The only thing I still find is present in “the youth conversation” is Zork. They know about it. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is one of the official games on the Archipelago randomizer. I sometimes feel like with some of the really obscure games I write about I’m going to be the last one in history who ever plays it, so I try my best to give them all a good showing even if they’re a 30 minute game off a weird tapemag. Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 6:05 pm > However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. Unfortunately, when I read that, I mentally translate it as “likely not accessible to blind people.” That’s what tends to happen when you take a game that’s text and choice based at its core and wrap it in something like Unity to give it mainstream appeal, as Inkle did. Text-based parser games tend to be accessible by default (in this sense, if not in the wider sense of being approachable to the mainstream), simply because of the constraints of the original medium and the variety of available interpreters (though some interpreters, like Gargoyle, weren’t screen-reader-accessible last time I checked). Yes, yes, I should revive my long-dormant screen reader accessibility plugin for Unity. I presented a proof-of-concept demo at NarraScope 2022 (Andrew happened to be the one who introduced that talk). At this point I’d be happy to hand off the project to someone else who has more familiarity with (and patience for) Unity than I have. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 6:09 pm Nah, we’ve got voice acting. Chandler Groover December 6, 2024 at 10:23 pm >I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. I discovered IF in 2014. It’s not retro to me. It’s contemporary! Eriorg December 7, 2024 at 8:19 pm Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. Actually, it was in 2006 (on April 30). Jerzy December 8, 2024 at 3:48 am Jimmy, thank you for making and posting this interview. Fascinating stuff. Andrew, thanks for all your incredible work over the years! Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I love your description of it here, and I can imagine mocking up a (much simpler!) version to assign to my undergrad students. Many of them seem genuinely perplexed when I ask where they saved their files for an assignment — “it’s, like, in the cloud?!” — and maybe a praser-5-lite game could help motivate them to learn this stuff. Andrew Plotkin December 8, 2024 at 7:34 pm > Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I do, but wow, it’s really ancient. I mean it’s written in C, and not even ANSI C — it’s K&R style. I’m not sure it would be a great introduction to the filesystem. I was trying to *subvert* the idea of the filesystem by making it look more like a text adventure. fform December 8, 2024 at 4:13 am Great interview. Regarding the discussion about AI at the end, while I can’t imagine “AI” (LLMs in this case) producing anything of interest, since it’s all just statistical prediction with no concept of what is actually being said, has anyone actually had an LLM AI play through a game? I’m curious now to know whether an LLM could statistically guess its’ way through a parser-based puzzle. stepped pyramids December 8, 2024 at 4:54 pm I’ve experimented both with using an LLM to solve a parser-based game and using it as a kind of “superparser” to translate natural language human input into commands. Both worked, but I don’t know how useful it is in practice (it’s kind of fun to translate “kiss my butt!” to “say insult to guard”, but I don’t know that it’s worth the latency).

Title: How to be more Danish this Christmas: A mismatched table and absolutely no matching pyjamas
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/property/interiors/2024/12/08/be-more-danish-this-christmas-a-mismatched-table-lights-in-the-windows-and-absolutely-no-matching-pyjamas/

If you don’t already know Nordic Elements, Helle Moyna’s shop in the village of Blackrock, Co Dublin, you should make the journey, to browse and to be beguiled. The shop has a reputation for high-end furniture but every surface is adorned with smaller potential gifts – ornaments and objects priced to suit every pocket, from €10 wooden spoons to books on design, via mugs and vases. Then there’s lighting and, of course, sofas to sink into. The approach taken to decor in Nordic Elements is reflected in Moyna’s home in nearby Booterstown. She is a fan of Christmas but don’t expect to see any glitter or snowglobes or tinsel in her house. While growing up in Jutland, Denmark, where people would always spend money on their homes, she says, the mantra was: “Buy well, buy less.” “We wouldn’t go out to eat much. We would entertain at home – cosy, nice furniture, nice accessories,” she recalls. The essence of hygge, the calm interior of Moyna’s home is understated, and yet there is something in every corner that draws the eye – from ceramics, collected on holidays, to gifts from a son’s girlfriend. Every object tells a story and all have become the building blocks of a home – one to which you’d relish an invitation. For Moyna, December is a particularly lovely period. To get in to the festive spirit, as she puts it, she has adorned the impressive entrance to her home with “an oversized wreath, with all kinds of foliage – eucalyptus, pinecones, pink and burgundy ribbons”. “It is illuminated by battery-operated lights,” she enthuses. “I get some help from Ruth Monaghan of Appassionata Flowers.” Lights thread through the railings out front too, and a miniature pine tree in a pot at the front door is similarly illuminated. Inside, on the hall return, a miniature tree draws the eye upwards; it and the Christmas trees – yes, trees, plural – are tastefully dressed in white lights. The star is the tree in the main livingroom, the grown-up room, as Moyna calls it; that one is always a real tree, she says. “I never saw a fake tree until I moved to London in my 20s.” It was in the UK capital that Moyna met her husband, David, from Scotstown in Co Monaghan. Her preference for a Christmas tree is Nordmann fir, an evergreen conifer with good symmetry – and “not too wide at the bottom” – which she orders from Kavanagh’s Christmas Farm at Glendarragh in Newtown Mount Kennedy, Co Wicklow. “They know what I want,” she says. “In Denmark we put live candles on trees. The first time my husband saw it he thought we were nuts. My dad is old school – that’s what we do. His tree comes the day before Christmas Eve.” The tree lights are still; no flickering, no colours. Hanging from the closers on all the livingroom’s large sash windows are big brass stars festooned with micro-lights. “It means there’s light in the windows even if we close the shutters.” A silver tray, bought in Lebanon on honeymoon, forms the base to a series of pillar candles, Moynagh’s Advent wreath, where she lights a candle each Sunday in Advent. She listens to music or podcasts as she decorates and enjoys the moment. “Life is busy. We don’t have enough time to potter.” Across the hall, in the family room, her sons, Tobias and Marcus, now 19 and 17 respectively, have always had a tree of their own that they decorate with all their stuff, as she puts it. “They open a huge box, close the door, put on Christmas music and decorate. The first year they did it they were just seven and five and they only decorated one side of the tree. It has loads of colour, although they didn’t decorate it last year as they were in Denmark.” [ How to establish your own interior design styleOpens in new window ] Given her sons’ ages, Moyna wasn’t sure the tradition would continue. But when the “boys” heard she was decorating the house early to give The Irish Times a sneak preview, they went out and got a tree of their own. It is as stylishly presented as their mum’s, with a classic red-and-white colour scheme. The dining table is set into bay windows that overlook the family’s large garden; here, beaded hearts hang from the window closers in the same fashion as the formal livingroom. She spotted the table at the last auction held by Adams in Blackrock; the steel pedestal base was visible but the teak tabletop was hidden from view by about an inch of varnish and a glass covering, as well as many other items for sale. It is relatively low-set, with three different kinds of stemware – “I like to set a mismatched table,” says Moyna. She uses living foliage to create maximum impact – keeping things “fragrant and simple”. Simple, yes, but highly effective – and stylish touches such as curling a long stem of fresh eucalyptus around a scrolled napkin and tying it in a knot are easy to replicate. Instead of putting a big bunch of flowers at the centre of the table, only for it to be moved elsewhere when the time comes to serve dinner, Moyna populates it with single-bud vases containing hyacinth bulbs and a centrepiece candelabra. “It’s about reusing stuff. It’s creative, relaxed and less formal,” she says. You could do something similar by putting short stems into low jars and bottles and tying a ribbon around them to add a flourish of colour. It is decor as an icebreaker. Elsewhere, the house stays as it usually is. This is not a Christmas pyjamas for all the family-type household, she says. She also says no to festive-motif bedding, yuletide towels in the bathrooms or Christmas-themed cushions. What type of Christmas personality does she have? “I really enjoy entertaining at home. I would rather have people over than eat out. I know it’s work but I have developed shortcuts over the years. I really relax cooking. I enjoy it. If I want help, I’ll ask for it.” Introduce art and wonderful scents combined to your home with ceramicist Bela Silva’s fragranced candles for Serax.

He’s an emergency physician and CEO of Starbot. We’re going to talk about the current state of Bitcoin and digital assets. Noah, welcome back to the show. Noah Kaufman: Kevin, thank you. I guess this is our third talk now. Kevin Pho: We have you on every year, and Bitcoin is at a different price every time we talk. Last night was a historic event—it broke $100,000. Before we get into anything, for those who may not be familiar with Bitcoin and digital assets, what does $100,000 for one Bitcoin mean to you? Noah Kaufman: Yeah, you know, it’s a milestone. It’s a stepping stone. It’s hard to talk about something exponential without being hyperbolic, right? On your podcast, we’ve been telling physicians—or, well, I was kind of pounding the table way back in 2019. Just because of the Sharpe ratio and the amazing adoption of this new monetary network, Bitcoin at $100,000 is kind of a stepping stone. When I say it’s hard not to be hyperbolic, I mean that some people are going crazy celebrating, but really, this is ultimately a multimillion-dollar asset. And, you know, we’re just getting started. It’s still extremely early—a very small number of people own Bitcoin or understand what it is. Believe it or not, I think $100,000 is not that big of a deal. It was expected. It was expected when I started buying it at hundreds of dollars, then at $10,000, and now $100,000. And now I expect $1 million, several million, and probably, in the next 20 years, there’s a good chance we’ll get to $10 million. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s hard to understand something exponential, growing by Metcalfe’s Law, that is so novel and so important for humanity. Kevin Pho: Well, tell us, what is Metcalfe’s Law? Noah Kaufman: Sure. Metcalfe’s Law describes the value of networks. For every participant in that network, the value of the network increases exponentially. The larger a network becomes, the more valuable it becomes exponentially. Of course, there’s a mathematical equation and a lot of research behind Metcalfe’s Law, but in a nutshell, that’s the lay version. We see it with Facebook and Amazon. Social networks are valued by the number of users and monetized through advertising or other means. That’s how Facebook makes its money. A monetary network, like the U.S. dollar system, has its value intrinsically tied to the value of each unit. Each participant makes the system more valuable. There’s been no network in history that has reached an inflation-adjusted $100 million market cap and failed. That’s never happened. Right now, we’re at a $2 trillion market cap for Bitcoin. We’re way beyond sustainability. Now there are ETFs, and there’s talk about a strategic Bitcoin reserve. If that happens, things will go crazy. Metcalfe’s Law is part of the reason why the Bitcoin network is so valuable, whether you agree with it or think it’s a scam. The fact of the matter is, all money systems are Ponzi schemes. This is a big legal Ponzi. It’s crazy, but all it takes is belief, political adoption, and legal adoption. We have that now with ETFs. It’s been de-risked. Compared to the last time we talked, the value of the network has gone up substantially because the risk has been taken away. Kevin Pho: So, we started off this year with Bitcoin in the $30,000 range. Now, it has broken $100,000 per Bitcoin. What were some of the triggers that led to its rise this year? Noah Kaufman: Certainly, the adoption of Bitcoin in the ETF world played a huge role. BlackRock—we all know BlackRock is holding hands with the United States government—gave more than a tacit approval of Bitcoin. Once money managers and Wall Street got into Bitcoin, it really changed the game. It takes a long time for pension funds and other large funds to be able to buy Bitcoin. Many of them won’t even buy it until it hits the $100,000 mark—that’s a mandate for a lot of pension funds. There are countless trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines in debt markets, looking for places to invest. Bitcoin is going to be a recipient of some of that capital—quite a bit of it, actually. This is due to the Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin has returned 147 percent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) over the last 14 years. It’s the best-performing asset of all time. It was the most-bought ETF of all time by far, dwarfing gold ETFs. Bitcoin is demonetizing precious metals and taking their place because it’s technologically superior. It’s completely finite, with 21 million Bitcoins scheduled to exist—94 percent of which have already been created. That means only 6 percent of Bitcoins are left to be mined for eternity. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins mined is cut in half. This is an absolutely scarce, inelastic supply running straight into an ever-expanding demand. From the early days, I’ve argued that this is such an asymmetric bet with such a great Sharpe ratio for your portfolio. More return for less risk—that’s what the Sharpe ratio tells you. I’ve said, “Why not put 1 percent of your net worth as a physician into it?” Myself and a bunch of friends started doing that when Bitcoin was $3,000, and now most of us are retired. We work because we want to. I’ve got a ton of Bitcoin, and I feel bad for those listening to White Coat Investor because they’ve been told, “This is horrible. This is bad.” But studies show that putting an asset with a high Sharpe ratio into your portfolio—even at a small percentage—can yield outsized returns for minimal risk. That’s always been the argument. Whether or not you believe in Bitcoin, you need to be agnostic if you want to act as a fiduciary for your family and financial situation. It’s still extremely early. Bitcoin is going to reach $1 million, then multi-millions per coin. I know it’s hard to believe, but this is exponential adoption. If you look at the chart, it’s a parabola. We’re right here, and it’s going up. You can’t think of it like a stock. It’s a new monetary system—an egalitarian one. Kevin Pho: Wrapping back to your earlier point, yes, the ETFs were a trigger. But what about global influences, like El Salvador or the Saudis? How do they play a role? Noah Kaufman: Absolutely. El Salvador adopting Bitcoin was a huge moment. There are also rumors that the Saudis are buying Bitcoin. Just yesterday, Putin made statements that likely pushed it over $100,000. He hinted that Bitcoin is an important world asset, and nobody can control it. Then there’s Trump. For better or worse, as president, he’s now talking about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and buying a million Bitcoin. If that happens, other countries will think, “Oh no, we better get some Bitcoin.” It’s a self-fulfilling process. This is why it’s crucial to remain agnostic. Bitcoin is a new, uncorrelated asset class. Yes, it’s volatile, but it’s volatile while going straight up, unlike fiat currency. With fiat currency, if you have $1 million today, in five to seven years, it will only have the purchasing power of $500,000. You need to invest to protect your wealth. Even if you invest in the S&P, you face currency risk and inflation. Sure, maybe you made 12 percent CAGR, but after inflation, what’s your real return? It’s like Pascal’s wager: even if you don’t believe in Bitcoin, the smart thing to do is to buy a little, just in case it catches on. Kevin Pho: You mentioned White Coat Investor earlier. For the record, I’m a big fan of White Coat Investor and the work they’ve done to bring physician financial literacy into the mainstream. But not just White Coat Investor—if you read finance articles in the New York Times or Washington Post, they aren’t as enthusiastic as you are. Why do you think that is? Noah Kaufman: First, let me say that White Coat Investor has been a net positive for physicians. I’ve learned a lot from them, and while we’ve had disagreements, I really respect Jim and everything he’s built. That said, I think he got it wrong on Bitcoin. When something is outside the current paradigm, it threatens existing power structures. Most people are conservative and prefer to stay safe within the status quo. Back when we first talked about Bitcoin, there wasn’t an ETF. Regulation from the SEC was a concern, and it was viewed as risky. Now, though, it’s different. Even Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, recently said that Bitcoin isn’t a competitor to the U.S. dollar. It’s a speculative asset and a competitor to gold. I agree—it’s a much better form of gold. If it reaches gold’s market cap, each Bitcoin would be worth $913,000. The opportunity here is to invest in something before everyone else recognizes its value. It’s like buying Amazon, Netflix, or Apple stock in the early 2000s. Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman famously said in the ’90s that the internet would be a passing fad and wouldn’t contribute meaningfully to GDP. Clearly, that was wrong. Investments like these are about seeing value before others do. That’s why I recommend putting a small percentage—1 percent, maybe 5 percent if you’re bold—of your portfolio into Bitcoin. If you lose 5 percent of your portfolio, it’s not the end of the world. But if that 5 percent grows tenfold, it could become a significant portion of your portfolio. Kevin Pho: That makes sense. You’ve touched on how Bitcoin fits into a portfolio and why its Sharpe ratio is attractive. But let’s talk about trust. There were significant losses with platforms like FTX and Voyager. How has that impacted Bitcoin adoption? Noah Kaufman: That’s a great point. The failures of centralized custodians like FTX and Voyager were devastating. I personally lost over 40 Bitcoin on Voyager. It was painful. Luckily, I’ve rebuilt my holdings, but it was a harsh lesson. These losses made one thing clear: self-custody is essential when it comes to Bitcoin. Even with platforms like Coinbase, I wouldn’t fully trust them for long-term storage. The mantra in the Bitcoin world is, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t hold the private keys to your Bitcoin, you don’t truly own it. That said, while retail adoption has slowed due to these setbacks, institutional adoption has surged. Many retail investors got burned by platforms like Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, and they’ve been hesitant to come back. It’s a “once bitten, twice shy” situation. However, institutions like Wall Street have been accumulating during this time, taking advantage of the lower prices. Now, Bitcoin is primed for its next big move, and we’re seeing the effects of that. Kevin Pho: With Bitcoin now surpassing $100,000, some may wonder if it’s too late for physicians to invest. What’s your perspective on that? Noah Kaufman: It’s definitely not too late. In fact, it’s still very early. Bitcoin follows mathematically defined cycles, which are volatile by nature. You’ll see 30 percent rises followed by 20 percent drops, or 50 percent gains followed by 10 percent pullbacks. It moves in stair-step patterns. Right now, we’re over $100,000, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Bitcoin dropped to $70,000 in a few weeks. People would then declare, “See? It’s failing; it’s a Ponzi scheme.” But shortly after, it might surge to $180,000. That’s how Bitcoin works. Its supply is extremely inelastic, and its demand keeps growing. Nation-states are buying it. Institutions are buying it. This dynamic creates an upward pressure on price over time. Sure, there will be corrections, but the long-term trajectory is up. For physicians, the idea is to allocate a small, speculative percentage of your net worth—1 to 5 percent—to Bitcoin. It’s not about day trading or trying to time the market. Bitcoin is something you buy and hold for the long term. If you buy now and hold for several years, the potential upside is significant. Kevin Pho: You mentioned earlier that Bitcoin could play a role in private practice or medical group balance sheets. Can you elaborate on that? Noah Kaufman: Absolutely. I consult with private practices and medical groups on this topic. There are ways to structure investments into Bitcoin legally and strategically. For example, instead of distributing 100 percent of profits as bonuses or reinvesting in traditional ways, practices could allocate a small percentage—say 5 percent—of their funds into Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet offers several benefits. First, there are favorable tax implications depending on how the investment is structured. Second, it diversifies the group’s financial strategy. Even if Bitcoin’s price remains stable, the potential for outsized returns over time makes it a compelling option. For practices, this is a way to strengthen financial resilience while taking advantage of an emerging asset class. It’s a no-brainer to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin. Of course, there are legal and accounting considerations, but I help groups navigate those complexities. Kevin Pho: Shifting gears a bit, let’s talk about how financial freedom impacts the physician lifestyle. You’ve mentioned that financial security has changed how you approach medicine. Can you share more about that? Noah Kaufman: Sure. When I started practicing medicine 20 years ago, finances weren’t as much of a concern. Physician salaries felt sufficient, and the administrative burden was lower. Today, it’s a different story. I recently spoke with a couple—a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist—who have $900,000 in student loans at a 7 percent interest rate. That’s crushing. Combine that with rising administrative demands, decreasing reimbursements, and inflation, and many young physicians feel stuck. Financial stress leads to burnout, compassion fatigue, and physician depression. It’s hard to provide great care when you’re overwhelmed by financial pressures. That’s where financial literacy and tools like Bitcoin come in. They empower physicians to take control of their finances, reduce debt, and find a better work-life balance. For me, I now practice medicine because I enjoy it, not because I have to. I work five or six days a month and spend the rest of my time rock climbing, riding motorcycles, or just enjoying life. This balance makes me a better physician and a happier person overall. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Noah Kaufman, an emergency physician and CEO of Starbot, about the current state of Bitcoin. Noah, as we wrap up, what take-home messages would you like to leave with the KevinMD audience? Noah Kaufman: The most important thing for physicians to understand is that Bitcoin is like Pascal’s wager. Even if you don’t believe in it and think it’s a Ponzi scheme, it still makes sense to allocate 1 to 5 percent of your portfolio to it. Why? Because the risk is asymmetric. If Bitcoin fails, you lose a small amount—no big deal. But if it succeeds and reaches $2 million or $3 million per coin, it could dramatically improve your financial situation. Bitcoin has been de-risked significantly over the past few years. Institutions, nation-states, and pension funds are accumulating it. It’s becoming a mainstream asset. Physicians should consider owning some—not just for financial gain but to combat inflation and secure their financial futures. Kevin, thank you for having me on again.

Title: 4 Stocks That Have Surged in 2024 — Are They Really Worth the Investment?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s a little hard to believe, but 2024 has been a great year for the stock market. Despite all the conflict and uncertainty around the world, the S&P 500 has notched a 26% gain year-to-date, far outstripping its long-term average annual return of around 10%. Read More: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Be Aware: Why Skipping a Financial Advisor Could Be Your Biggest Money Mistake Passive investors, who try to replicate the performance of the total market by investing in index funds, have had a great year so far — but there are always some stocks that perform even better than the market average. Most investors who buy individual stocks typically are trying to beat the market and get those outsized returns. When a stock does beat the market, fear of missing out can make it very tempting to invest, but past performance is no guarantee of future success. What has gone up can always come down, so should you buy? Here’s a look at four stocks that have done well in 2024. Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move? YTD gain: 44.17% Better known by its former name, Raytheon Technologies, RTX Corporation is the second largest defense contractor in the United States. As a large conglomerate, it is engaged in a variety of businesses that include aerospace products, aircraft engines and missile systems. Given the amount of military aid that the U.S. is currently sending to several conflict zones, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a defense contractor is doing well. Whether or not that success will continue is unclear. Dr. Peter C. Earle, senior economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, noted that a new presidential administration could have an impact on RTX’s business. “Should the incoming Trump administration follow through on its pledges to force other nations to fend for themselves, the largest publicly traded defense contractors might be poised for a pullback,” Earle said. Verdict: NO Check Out: 3 Undervalued Stocks To Buy Before 2025, According to Experts YTD gain: 83.12% Investors have generally been very well rewarded for holding the stock of retail titan Walmart, and this year has been no exception, as the stock has seen more than double the return of the S&P 500. However, there are some possibly very troubling headwinds that have the potential to make a massive impact on Walmart’s operations. “A cornerstone of the Trump campaign has been tariffs and other forms of trade protectionism. If tariffs of the type which have been discussed are put in place — 60%, 100%, 200%, and so on — retaliatory tariffs would follow. Those could, in turn, devastate companies that rely on imports, [such as] Walmart,” Earle said, citing the fact that Walmart imports many of its goods from Chinese suppliers. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 69.97% Abercrombie & Fitch is a specialty retailer of apparel whose stock has been absolutely surging through 2024. Although down from its mid-year high share price of almost $200, it has still had eye-popping returns for the year so far. Derrick Fung is the CEO of Signals, an investment intelligence platform that tracks consumer spending data to help investors anticipate market movements. His platform’s data indicates a down trend on companies that sell “nice to have” non-durable products — things like higher end cosmetics, apparel and home furnishings. “Our data has been showing a down trend on [ANF] — i.e. we’ve gotten a SELL Signal on all these names in the last 45 days — and the signal has worked on all of them,” Fung said. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 192.98% Chipmaker Nvidia has made a lot of headlines over the last year, as it has skyrocketed to become the second largest company in the world, right behind Apple. Its specialty is in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are highly prized for artificial intelligence applications, and its business has surged along with the wave of hype surrounding generative AI. It’s hard for a business to maintain such a stunning level of growth, so investors may be wondering if it’s time to get off of the rocket. However, for the stock analysts that cover Nvidia, there remains a high degree of enthusiasm for the business. Of the 63 analysts currently making recommendations, 57 of them rate NVDA as a Buy or a Strong Buy. That’s over 90%, and that level of consensus among analysts is often rare.

Title: 5 Stock Buys And Sells From Top Billionaire Investors

Over the past 30 months, the reported moves of billionaire investors were a major consideration in the strategies we have used to construct our two Forbes Billionaire Investor model portfolios, but they were not the only factor. We also sought out stocks that had compelling value appeal with low debt levels and strong business fundamentals, which means stocks trading at depressed valuations that still produce rising revenues and profits. Except for Walt Disney (DIS), which had exceptional interest from activist billionaire investors, we’ve required our stocks to pay dividends. We also wanted to see evidence of recent insider buying among company managers and directors. The strategy has yielded great success. When we launched Forbes Billionaire Investor in September 2022, we bought large-cap future home runs like retail success stories Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS +118%) and Ross Stores (ROST +90%), as well as “Magnificent Seven” member Microsoft (MSFT +84%). Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune in excess of $150 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, almost triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, who is worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric, the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings, which owns online marketplace Temu.

Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune in excess of $150 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, almost triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, who is worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric, the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings, which owns online marketplace Temu. Another recent China buy from Tepper is JD.com. John Dobosz is editor of Forbes Billionaire Investor newsletter. Click here to follow John on LinkedIn.

Title: Why QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) Is Among the Best Affordable Stocks to Buy Right Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best affordable stocks to buy. There has been a growing debate regarding whether the economy of the United States will have a soft landing. A recent report by Vanguard titled “Beyond Landing” released on November 25 discusses the economic outlook for the year ahead. The report highlighted that global inflation has significantly decreased over the past two years, nearing the target of 2%. However, this decline has been inconsistent across different regions, with many developed markets experiencing slowdowns due to monetary policy adjustments. The United States stands out as an exception, showcasing robust economic growth and full employment despite restrictive monetary policies. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. The report raised critical questions about whether the US has achieved a "soft landing" or if high interest rates will eventually lead to a "hard landing." The narrative has largely focused on the Federal Reserve's ability to time rate cuts effectively to facilitate painless disinflation. Vanguard suggests that the strong growth and falling inflation in the US may be better explained by supply-side dynamics, such as increased labor productivity and a surge in available labor, rather than solely by Federal Reserve policies. Regarding the 2025 outlook, the firm anticipates that US real GDP growth may decline from around 3% to closer to 2%, influenced by potential policy risks like trade tariffs and stricter immigration regulations. Core inflation is expected to remain above 2.5% for most of 2025. The firm also predicts that interest rates will stabilize at levels higher than those seen during the 2010s, fostering better returns in cash and fixed-income markets over the next decade. However, they express caution regarding equity markets due to elevated valuations. The report highlights a tension between momentum and valuation in risk assets, suggesting that while some stocks may continue to perform well, their high valuations could pose risks if economic conditions change unexpectedly. A technician testing the latest 5G device, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation. To compile the list of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we shortlisted stocks trading below a Forward P/E of 15, as of December 4, and that are expected to experience earnings growth this year. Next, we sorted our initial list by market capitalization and cross-checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward P/E Ratio: 14.16 Earnings Growth This Year: 9.52% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a prominent technology company specializing in wireless communication technologies. It designs and manufactures integrated circuits and software for smartphones and smart devices, as well as advanced automotive technologies like automated driving systems. Its competitive edge originates from the numerous patents it holds in wireless technology. The company’s smartphone chipset, the Snapdragon series is one of the most widely used in the industry. Its Snapdragon X75 modem is not only being used to power the new iPhone 16 models but is also the powerhouse of the generative AI-enabled Galaxy series. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 alone, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) generated $33.2 billion in QCT revenue, up 9% year-over-year. Within the QCT segment handset revenue contributed $6.1 billion mainly due to the quick adoption of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Looking ahead, Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 is expected to utilize the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, indicating continued growth for the company. Moreover, other manufacturers such as ASUS, Honor, OnePlus, and OPPO are also launching devices with this chipset. Management anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. were the largest detractors. Qualcomm has given back some of its first half gains after the CFO commented at a conference that its entrance into the AI PC business would take time to ramp. We continue to see Qualcomm as well positioned with growth from AI moving into the mobile phone, from new opportunities in the Internet of Things (IoT), and within the Auto industry but will also look to future growth as they enter the PC market.” Overall, QCOM ranks 8th on our list of best affordable stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Microsoft Corporation Inc. (MSFT) Dominating A Billionaire Quant’s Investment Strategy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. "We let the machine decide more," Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Position size: $1.73 billion Activity: 5% Microsoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago: Analysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive." At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock. Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other lithium and battery stocks. According to a Reuters report from November 6, automakers are preparing for potential changes under President-elect Donald Trump, including new tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico and the reversal of pro-electric vehicle policies. Trump has indicated plans to rescind EPA and Transportation Department regulations and may reduce or eliminate EV tax incentives. Moreover, the Zero Emission Transportation Association expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump on future EV development. Trump has also warned of tariffs of up to 200% on Mexican vehicles and is considering similar measures for imports from other regions while encouraging foreign automakers to build plants in the US. Additionally, in October, Reuters reported that the European Union approved additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, ranging from 7.8% to 35.3%, on top of the existing 10% duty, in response to what it calls unfair subsidies by China. These tariffs, effective October 30, aim to address concerns over subsidized raw materials, batteries, and financing, with China opposing the decision and calling for negotiations to prevent further trade tensions. China has launched its own probes into EU imports, including pork, dairy, and brandy, potentially retaliating against the EU measures. Chinese EVs currently account for 8% of the EU market, a figure expected to grow to 15% by 2025, with their prices typically 20% lower than European counterparts. The investigation has caused division within the EU, with Germany opposing tariffs while France supports them. GlobalData lowered its 2030 U.S. EV market share forecast from 33% to 28%, citing weakened emissions standards and a focus on lower oil prices after the 2024 elections. Bloomberg reported on November 7 that Mark Wakefield of AlixPartners highlighted that $129 billion in EV investments through 2027 and the $7,500 EV tax credit may be at risk. Automakers are expected to cut EV spending, delay new models, and shift production toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles, like Volkswagen’s adaptation at its South Carolina plant. While reversing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could prove challenging, changes to fuel economy standards are likely, though their impact may not be felt until later in the decade. The lithium market has experienced a huge decline over the past several quarters due to oversupply and lower demand. However, Ana Cabral, Co-Chair & CEO at Sigma Lithium is positive about the future demand for lithium as discussed in a September interview with CNBC. She noted that lithium prices hit a low point in August but have been recovering steadily. The Chinese recovery package, the largest since COVID, has especially boosted the market, as China accounts for more than half of global EV sales. While the U.S. has seen slower EV adoption compared to China and Europe, with growth in China outpacing the U.S. and Europe, the fundamentals remain strong. As China continues to dominate the EV market, it plays a crucial role in driving demand and lithium prices. Regarding other uses of lithium, Cabral emphasized that EV batteries remain the primary driver, especially as automakers shift away from combustion vehicles, which is expected to create further demand in the coming years. Our Methodology For this article, we used stock screeners to identify around 20 lithium and/or battery stocks and chose the 11 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading electric vehicle company with key ventures in batteries and solar technology. It plans to invest $3.6 billion in Nevada to build a factory producing 4680 battery cells, essential for the Cybertruck, which requires around 7 GWh of battery capacity annually. Additionally, the company is committing $1 billion to establish a lithium refinery in Texas, designed to sustainably produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide. This facility is expected to support 50 GWh of annual output, improving battery supply and reducing costs. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk seems to have a close relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump which could prove beneficial for the company. Reports suggest that the Trump administration plans to prioritize creating federal regulations for self-driving vehicles. According to a Bloomberg report from November 17, this initiative would focus on easing restrictions through the Department of Transportation, aligning with Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) investments in autonomous technology. Current regulations limit the production and deployment of fully autonomous cars, but potential federal rule changes could support the company’s goals. Elon Musk has voiced support for nationwide policies enabling self-driving vehicle use. Moreover, the market is anticipating that the President-Elect is likely to cancel the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) EV tax credits, which Elon Musk is less worried about. In the company’s Q2 earnings call in July, Colin Langan of Wells Fargo asked Elon Musk about the potential impact on Tesla if the IRA was repealed under a Trump presidency. Langan noted Tesla benefits from EV subsidies and production tax credits for batteries. Musk acknowledged that while losing IRA support would have some negative effects on Tesla, it would be far more damaging to competitors. Musk said: “I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors. But — and it would hurt Tesla slightly. But long-term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess. Yes — but I’ve said this before on earnings calls, it — the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy. So I recommend anyone who doesn’t believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. You should believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are in the noise.” Overall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The head of a $210 billion asset management firm has decided to unload a massive pile of assets. Billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, has sold off 68% of the firm’s Walmart (WMRT) position – 8.1 million shares worth about $745 million – according to its latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data compiled by TickerTracker, Millennium has also significantly decreased its holdings of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). In total, the shares sold by Millennium Management in Q3 amount to more than $20 billion. Meanwhile, Englander has reportedly increased the firm’s exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) as well as Microsoft (MSFT) and Spotify (SPOT). Englander is also shifting his focus in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, selling 95% of the firm’s shares in Rivian (RIVN) to get into the electric air flying taxi company Archer Aviation (ACHR), a favorite of ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Englander acquired 3,247,428 shares of the company, while Wood has been accumulating ACHR since August of 2023. ACHR is down 53% from its all-time high of $18.49 but up over 204% in the last month alone. Millenium Management has recorded 162% gains over the last four years. Other billionaire portfolio shakeups reported recently include Bill Ackman’s recent accumulation of asset manager Brookfield Corporation and apparel giant Nike, and Ken Fisher’s $800,000,000 bet on the US banking industry with his purchase of JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

Jay Jacobs, the firm's U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, cites the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. "It's still very early in the AI adoption cycle," he told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. According to Jacobs, AI companies need to build out their data centers. Plus, keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the new year. "If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable," he said. "We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI." Jacobs also sees a wider impact in terms of the supporting infrastructure. "I think what people forget is kind of, magical as technology is, there's real physical things on the ground that run that technology, whether it's power, whether it's data centers and real estate, whether it's chips. It's not just something that lives in the ether, in the cloud, there's real physical things that have to happen, and that means energy, that means more materials like copper, that means more real estate. You really have to think about kind of the physical infrastructure that underlies it," he added. So, for Jacobs, the theme is widening one's investment scope. "It's not just about megacap tech names. There's other semiconductor companies, there's other data center companies, there's other software companies that are benefiting from the rise of this theme," he said. Jacobs cited BlackRock's iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY) and iShares AI Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) as potential ways to benefit from the rise in AI. The iShares Future AI & Tech ETF is up around 13% for the year so far, while the iShares AI Innovation and Tech Active ETF is up around 13% since its Oct. 21 launch as of Friday's close.

Title: Lunex Network To Score More Gains as Bitcoin, Ether Look to Set New All-Time Highs This Altseason
URL: https://zycrypto.com/lunex-network-to-score-more-gains-as-bitcoin-ether-look-to-set-new-all-time-highs-this-altseason/
Time Published: 2024-12-07T14:55:45Z

The slowdown of the Bitcoin (BTC) price pump has led many top analysts to predict the beginning of the alt season. According to forecasts, two top altcoins to watch are Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Seth has predicted an SOL price pump of $800 following the application of an ETF from Grayscale. Ali Martinez has shared a long-term price target of $10k for ETH if it maintains its ascending channel. While these are potentially massive gains for SOL and ETH, Lunex Network (LNEX) has been picked as the dark horse for this altseason as it looks to pump by up to 15x. Although the Ethereum coin did not have some other top altcoins’ explosive price pumps, analysts expect it to in the near future. As revealed in a recent analysis by Ali Martinez, ETH is now trading in an ascending channel that could trigger a massive price hike. Martinez also predicts ETH could hit $6,000 mid-term. The analyst believes Ethereum (ETH) could be as high as $10k in the long term. However, according to CoinMarketCap’s data, the Ethereum crypto is trading comfortably above this support level in the $3,700 range. Hinting at a potential reason for the price increase, Armando Pantoja reported that BlackRock has bought over $230 million worth of ETH. Solana (SOL) failed to break above $250 after multiple trials in November despite recording its biggest monthly candle ever. Based on CoinMarketCap’s data, we can see that the Solana crypto has traded in the $220 to $250 price range on the weekly timeframe. While the breathtaking November Solana (SOL) price rally has cooled off, Seth has shared a new target for the altcoin. According to Seth, Grayscale’s application for a Solana ETF could push the altcoin price as high as $800 to $1,400 this altseaon, making SOL one of the best cryptos now. Another crypto analyst, Jelle, has explained that $SOL has bounced off from the 200EMA, leading to a breakout from the falling wedge. As a result, Jelle predicts that the Solana price could pump to a new all-time high soon. Unlike many top crypto coins, the recent 200% price pump of Lunex Network (LNEX) has set a new all-time high at $0.0036. The Lunex Network’s disruptive potential has caught the eye, helping the DeFi project raise over $4.1 million. Most analysts think this is the reason LNEX could extend its gains by up to 15x over this altseason. Lunex Network’s high return, at an APY of 18%, has made it one of the most promising coins in the DeFi market. Unlike conventional exchanges, Lunex offers low-cost swaps between different chains for over 50,000 assets. Lunex also operates on a non-custodial approach, allowing traders full control over their funds and private keys. Lunex Network also does not make its users go through a lengthy know-your-customer process to open an account. The revenue share policy on Lunex is its most valuable feature. Half of a dedicated part of its revenue used to repurchase LNEX coins from the market is used to pay stakers. The other half is kept for other incentives to create a highly sustainable ecosystem. All of these features make Lunex a unique opportunity to get the maximum privacy, security, and obviously huge profits in the DeFi space. The incoming alt season has excited crypto enthusiasts as altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) look to surge to new ATHs finally. However, all eyes have been on Lunex Network because of its exciting features and potential 15x price pump.

Title: Why Is Bank of Montreal (BMO) Among the Best Bank Stocks to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Bank Stocks With High Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) stands against the other bank stocks. In 2023, the US banking industry took a major hit, as Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, followed by the downfall of two other major banks. It was the biggest shake-up the industry had seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the US banking crisis, the past two years have been the best for banks since before the Great Recession. Shocking, right? According to McKinsey, banks made $7 trillion in revenue and $1.1 trillion in net income globally during 2023, with a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. They have also strengthened their capital and liquidity, with capital levels at 12.8% and liquidity at 77.2%, both improving from 2022. In fact, banks earned more profit than any other sector worldwide last year. Right now, 14% of banks are making up 80% of the industry's economic profit, which is a big jump from 11% in 2013. This is nearly five times higher than most other industries, where a few big players usually dominate the performance. In 2023, global dividends surged to a record $1.66 trillion, marking a 5.0% increase on an underlying basis, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. The banking sector played a key role in this growth, delivering record payouts and accounting for half of the global increase in dividends. Higher interest rates allowed many banks to expand their margins, with emerging market banks contributing significantly to this increase – though banks in China didn't join in the dividend boom. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket and 15 AI News That Broke The Internet. The banking sector is anticipated to maintain its strong performance this year, with analysts offering an optimistic outlook. On December 4, 2024, Moody's upgraded the global banking sector from negative to stable. The credit rating giant is positive because G-20 countries are easing up on interest rates and making some monetary adjustments, which should help with the asset quality and liquidity of banks. The economy seems to be stabilizing, and that should help banks recover, especially in terms of deposits. Of course, there are some risks like geopolitical tensions, trade issues, and possible shifts in the US policies under the new president could create uncertainties that might affect the global economy and the banking sector. So, while things are looking better, there is still some uncertainty on the horizon. Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out bank stocks with dividend yields exceeding 3%. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yields, as of December 6. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A well-dressed executive discussing financial strategy with a client in a busy office. Dividend Yield as of December 6: 4.62% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) operates mainly in North America, where it provides financial services including personal and commercial banking, wealth management, and capital markets. Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) announced a quarterly dividend of C$1.59 per share on December 5, marking a 2.6% increase from the previous dividend of C$1.55. The dividend will be paid on February 26 to shareholders on record as of January 30. This bank has consistently paid dividends to shareholders since 1829 and has increased its payouts annually for the past eight years. That puts BMO on our list of the best bank stocks for a dividend portfolio. In BMO's Q4 2024 earnings call, the bank shared that a year ago, it expected higher interest rates and a slowing economy to make things more difficult for business activity, loan demand, and credit. To stay ahead, Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) took early action, managing costs while still supporting customers, which led to solid results. However, credit performance was worse than anticipated, resulting in a drop in net income for the year to $7.4 billion and earnings per share to $9.68. Despite the tough year, there’s a lot to be proud of. The bank saw a 5% increase in pre-tax earnings to $13.4 billion, improved efficiency, and grew its core customer base, with deposits rising by $61 billion or 9%. BMO expects provisions to ease off through 2025. According to Insider Monkey’s third-quarter data, Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) was present in 14 hedge fund portfolios. Arrowstreet Capital is the largest position holder in the bank, with nearly 1.5 million shares worth $133.2 million. Overall BMO ranks 3rd on our list of the best bank stocks with high dividends. While we acknowledge the potential of BMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Economist and longtime market bear David Rosenberg is coming around after this year's blistering stock market rally. While he says his updated view doesn't amount to "throwing in the towel," he admits that the technology-fueled AI boom is requiring him to reframe his thinking on the broader stock market. "It's high time for me to stop pontificating on all the reasons why the U.S. stock market is crazily overvalued and all the reasons to be bearish based on all the variables I have relied on in the past," Rosenberg wrote to his clients on Thursday. Rosenberg has long relied on today's stock market valuations relative to the past to highlight just how historically extreme the stock market is currently valued. And he's not wrong. Longtime stock bull Ed Yardeni highlighted five charts this week that showed that valuations have been stretched to historical extremes. However, according to Rosenberg, the extreme valuations may actually be warranted if AI can unleash a wave of productivity upon the economy. This idea was echoed by BlackRock in its 2025 outlook, which argued that comparing today's market valuations to those of the past is "apples to oranges" given the profound shift in America's tech-led economy. Perhaps more importantly, the promise of AI is ultimately leading investors to extend their time horizons beyond the traditional one-year outlook. "Investors are clearly looking out beyond one year across an entire gamut of indicators and developments, so the classic way we look at valuations may not be appropriate today," Rosenberg said. Rosenberg added that even if the stock market is in a bubble, it may not be apparent for years to come, similar to the internet bubble that began to form in the mid-1990s before ultimately popping in 2000. With profits booming for technology companies like Nvidia, the exuberance gripping investors doesn't appear to be extreme or unsustainable. "A bear market only ensues if and when these expectations prove to have been excessive. That day may well come, but Mr. Market has been saying for some time: 'not quite yet,'" Rosenberg said. A shift in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy could also send markets lower, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards in the near term. Going forward, Rosenberg said he is keeping a more open mind toward the idea that the stock market bull rally could "go further than anyone thinks." "The way to redress the lament of a bear is to keep an open mind as we head into 2025 and learn from the mistakes of the past year," Rosenberg said. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Warren Buffett once called an investment a ‘terrible long-term asset’ — but he’s holding $325B of it today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Warren Buffett has never shied away from calling out underperforming investments. Among his most scathing critiques? An asset virtually everyone owns — cash. Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how In a 2008 op-ed for The New York Times, Buffett warned, “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value.” Buffett had a point. Interest rates were low in 2008, so cash didn’t pay much. Meanwhile, inflation steadily eroded the purchasing power of money, diminishing cash's real value over time. Fast forward to today, and the story seems to have taken an unexpected turn. By the end of Q3 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves had swelled to a staggering $325.2 billion. The sheer size of Buffett’s cash pile has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about his strategy. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan told Reuters that the growing cash reserve “begs questions about whether Buffett thinks stocks are overvalued or an economic downturn is coming, or is trying to build cash for a big acquisition.” Similarly, CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert interpreted Berkshire’s cash hoarding as signaling a "risk-off" mindset, according to the report, which could lead investors to worry about its implications for the economy and markets. Buffett himself has addressed concerns about his cash strategy, explaining his cautious approach during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year. “I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated, emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.” Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.” While Buffett is holding a massive cash pile, his warning about its drawbacks remains relevant. Inflation continues to chip away at the purchasing power of your hard-earned money. Putting your money to work not only helps you grow your wealth but also shields it from inflation’s long-term erosive effects. Read more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024 Here are three popular ways to make your cash work harder: As one of the most successful investors, Buffett built his fortune on investing in equities — particularly U.S. stocks. In his 2016 letter to shareholders, he expressed unwavering confidence in American businesses: “American business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.” Berkshire’s performance serves as a powerful testament to that principle. From 1964 to 2023, the company delivered an astonishing overall gain of 4,384,748%. While Buffett is legendary for picking winning companies, he’s an even bigger advocate for a simpler, tried-and-true strategy: investing in an S&P 500 index fund. “In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” he famously stated. This straightforward approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across various industries, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. Following this strategy has never been easier. Today, a variety of apps allow you to invest in index funds like the S&P 500 seamlessly — some will even round up spare change from everyday purchases to build your portfolio. It’s a low-effort, high-impact way to grow your wealth over time. Real estate has long been considered a reliable hedge against inflation, thanks to its intrinsic value and income-generating potential. When inflation rises, property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. At the same time, rental income tends to go up, providing landlords with a revenue stream that adjusts for inflation. This combination makes real estate an attractive option for preserving and growing wealth during periods of escalating price levels. In 2022, Buffett stated that if you offered him “1% of all the apartment houses in the country” for $25 billion, he would “write you a check.” Whether the economy is booming or in a recession, people need a place to live. And with real estate prices rising to unaffordable levels in many parts of the country, renting has become the only option for many people. These days, you don’t need to purchase a property outright to invest in real estate. REITs are a popular choice for those looking to gain exposure to this essential market. Companies like American Homes 4 Rent (AMH) focus on single-family rental homes, while Equity Residential (EQR) targets multifamily housing in high-demand urban areas. These companies can serve as a starting point for further research. Meanwhile, crowdfunding platforms allow everyday investors to own shares in rental properties without the large down payments or management headaches traditionally associated with real estate ownership. Before you invest, make sure you understand all the risks of real estate crowdfunding. Keep in mind, there’s no guarantee of receiving rental income deposits from your investment and your money will be locked up until the property is sold, so there’s no liquidity. Gold is another popular hedge against inflation. The reason is straightforward: the yellow metal can’t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks like fiat money. And because its value isn’t tied to any one currency or economy, gold could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty. This unique characteristic has earned it the reputation of being a “safe haven” asset. When inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, gold's appeal as a stable store of value often grows, driving up demand. Investors have already taken note of its resilience. So far in 2024, gold prices have surged by 27%, surpassing $2,600 per ounce. Economist Peter Schiff sees substantial further upside for gold. “If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or even to $100,000. There’s no limit because, again, gold isn’t changing — it’s the value of the dollar that’s decreasing,” he recently stated. There are multiple ways to invest in gold. Car insurance in America now costs a stunning $2,329/year on average — but here’s how 2 minutes can save you more than $600 in 2025 I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 3 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

Title: Trying new social media tactics to stand out in ‘brutal’ job market

From cash rewards to “desperate” banners, more job seekers are getting creative to land their next employment. SAN FRANCISCO — Job hunting for Nadeera Waduwara Kankanamalage has been nothing short of frustrating over the past two years. So a week before Thanksgiving, the 32-year-old Austin resident took an unlikely approach to landing a new tech gig: He went on LinkedIn offering a $3,000 reward to anyone who connects him to his next job. Kankanamalage’s written plea in his post sums up what many job seekers are experiencing right now: The market is “brutal” and the number of rejections are “a gut punch.” “It’s a whatever-it-takes mentality,” he said in an interview with the Washington Post. “Hopefully it’s a good signal for a potential employer that I’m proactive, and I’m trying to solve this problem in a creative way.” Exasperated by too much competition, no return communications, and automated rejection letters, job seekers are getting creative on social media to get a foot in the door. Many of them have spent months looking for roles, applying to hundreds of openings and turning to social media with seemingly nothing to lose. Some are offering rewards for job leads, tagging employers in their posts in the hopes of getting a comment, and getting vulnerable with videos and banners that say they are “desperate” for work. Their approaches represent a marked shift from how people used to handle layoffs and employment. That shift “might be a by-product of people’s greater willingness to be open,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School. “Not too long ago, people would’ve been mortified to say they were open to work.” Kankanamalage said he is trying different things to see “what sticks.” “I need to be creative in getting myself into the workforce again,” he said. While more people are using social media networks to amplify their job hunt, unemployment remains relatively low in the United States at 4.1 percent, just above the 54-year record low last year of 3.4%, according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong labor market is expected to continue into next year under the new presidential administration, House predicts. Despite the strong labor market, some industries are experiencing substantial churn as they reconfigure their workforce to address evolving business needs like artificial intelligence, he added. The share of people who have been unemployed for six months or more is increasing, while many workers may be less likely to relocate due to low mortgage rates that they scored during the pandemic, he said. Some job seekers have taken to TikTok, shedding tears as they explain their layoffs and ask for help. Others are making creative videos to show their skills, or producing video resumés. Then there’s the multitude of people who are making their case on the professional networking platform LinkedIn. Laura Martyna, a recruiting and human resources professional, created a mini marketing campaign for herself on LinkedIn after being laid off in September. Even though the 43-year-old in Concord, N.C., has more than 15 years of experience, including at Amazon, she said she’s only landed two interviews out of hundreds of job applications. When her dream job at Eli Lilly opened, she listed the reasons the company should hire her. She tagged the company, as well as former colleagues and bosses, whom she asked to add comments to support her effort. She also tagged the hiring manager, who responded with appreciation for the enthusiasm. “I don’t know how else to get flashing lights to get attention,” Martyna said the day after she posted. “It’s worth a shot. Nothing else is working.” Days later, Martyna got an automated rejection letter. But shortly after, the hiring manager asked to set up a meeting to learn more about her. For Martyna, the post paid off. Other job seekers have tried to cast wide nets by using banners that border their LinkedIn profile pictures with the phrase Open to Work. It’s one of the most common banners used, but some who’ve added it complain that it lures scams and bots. As an alternative, some LinkedIn members created their own banners using words like motivated or excited instead. One banner, made by a designer out of Britain, briefly went viral a couple of months ago. It pulled no punches with one blunt word: desperate. Jordan Dye, a 27-year-old, who’s been trying to break into the cybersecurity industry, added it to his profile immediately after seeing it. “I saw an opportunity, took it and then it blew up way bigger than I thought,” said the Dallas resident, who previously had relatively few LinkedIn connections. “I have over 1,600 followers now.” Dye said his post explaining the banner got about a half-million views, connections, and a lot of discussion. But he didn’t hear from hiring managers. He later changed his banner to Dying, playing off his name and the widespread desperation in the market. Dye, who for now isn’t using either banner, estimated he’s applied to 4,500 jobs since June 2023. Another job seeker, Rita Williams, initially used the banner in solidarity with the “desperate” movement. But the 38-year-old, who’s seeking a job as a technical analyst for a social justice reform organization, still displays it after two months, eight interviews, and 500 applications. “It seems like it became an indicator of, ‘Wow this person has been through it,’” she said about the banner. “It generates interest, and people are kinder.” She said she’s also in the process of creating a nonprofit. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” she said. LinkedIn said people who use the Open to Work banner on average are 40% more likely to receive messages from recruiters and 20% more likely to receive messages from other members. To avoid scams, LinkedIn said job seekers should look for verification badges on job postings and profiles. Given LinkedIn’s easy-apply button, and generative AI, which can quickly tailor a resumé for a specific job, employers and recruiters are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of candidates. But two recruiters were mixed on whether social media posts are a reliable way to stand out in the candidate pool. “Some of them are entertaining, but I don’t know if I’d hire based off that,” said Mindy Totaro, a senior creative recruiter at staffing agency Aquent. “Do you understand the skills or is it about just trying to get someone to respond?” Instead, Totaro says job seekers should focus on building relationships with recruiters and hiring managers, even if they don’t pay off right away, and ensure that their resumé skills match the job. It’s also best to be among the first applicants because recruiters sometimes have just 24 hours to present top candidates. To see job postings faster, follow recruiters and employers on social media, she said. But Thomas Vick, a technology employment trends expert and regional president with recruiting firm Robert Half, said creative posts — when done right — may give job seekers a leg up. “Anything that differentiates you in a positive, productive manner, especially if you can highlight how it can be beneficial to the business … it certainly can help,” he said, adding that candidates should try to stand out. Some job seekers exhausted by the void of silence and repeated rejections are becoming brutally honest. Feeling invisible after hundreds of applications, Chuck Williams let his LinkedIn network know that he’s on the verge of losing his house. Williams, a 36-year-old husband and father of two in Richland, Wash., said he was laid off just two months after purchasing the house. Six months later, he made his vulnerable LinkedIn plea for leads. “I genuinely needed to be honest about where I’m at and what I feel,” he said. Since the post, he’s received at least 3,000 comments and messages, mostly from people facing similar struggles. The post hasn’t led to a job, but it did land him two interviews with hiring managers. The outpouring of support that came from that post taught Williams a lesson: “There isn’t a silver bullet here. But what I think resonates with people is honesty.”

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits.

Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Ether ‘Impulse Breakout’ Sets The Stage For $15,000 Price By May 2025, According To Pundit

After months of lackluster action, the price of Ethereum (ETH) rocketed above the $4,000 price point on Friday, a level not seen since March. The upward move came as an analyst pointed out a bullish pattern recently formed on the Ether chart. According to their analysis, the second-largest crypto is gearing up for a big breakout. According to data from CoinGecko, Ether’s price has since settled at $4,002 as of press time, still up 2.8% on the day after giving up some gains above $4K. A popular analyst going by the online moniker venturefounder on X believes that Ethereum is about to register an astronomical rally that will send its price to a new all-time high. Venturefounder noted that ETH is on the verge of breaking out of a three-year consolidation phase. Moreover, the trader thinks Ether could soon break out of the range where it has hovered for the last seven years. Venturefounder postulated: “Ethereum likely to repeat this impulsive breakout it did after between 2016-2017 to shoot to new ATH. Price Target: $15,937 by May 2025.” Ethereum’s market cap would soar above $1 trillion for the first time ever if its price nears $16,000. Nevertheless, the pundit indicates that ETH must first close its weekly candle with $3,800 support to be able to first retest its current lifetime high of $4,878 en route to new ATHs. Ether’s latest surge above $4K follows the nine ETH ETFs’ biggest single-day of inflows in history, according to data from Farside Investors. The $431 million in inflows registered on Thursday surpassed the previous record of $333 million on Nov. 29. Despite a tepid launch, the Ether ETFs have been at a daily net positive since Nov. 21 and have accumulated over $1.1 billion in net inflows in the past two weeks. The BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust contributed the lion’s share of the day’s inflows, with a record $292.7 million. This wave of increased investment has pushed Ethereum’s market value to over $486 billion as of publication time. The bullish price movement reflects traders’ optimism following President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment this week of Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission chair and David Sacks as the crypto czar — both prominent pro-crypto advocates. Some analysts are now convinced that a new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly SEC will likely approve spot ETH ETF staking yields.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) stands against the other dividend stocks that beat the market in the last 3 years. The broader market has been performing strongly this year, rising by nearly 30% since the beginning of 2024. According to Morningstar Direct, the S&P 500's return has exceeded this level in only 17 of the past 74 years. For instance, in 1954, the index saw a gain of over 52%, and in 1989, it increased by about 31%. However, analysts caution investors to manage their expectations, as years with such exceptional returns are uncommon. Cathy Curtis, a certified financial planner and the founder and CEO of Curtis Financial Planning made the following comment about the market’s performance this year in one of her recent interviews with CNBC: “Investors should know that the stock market has an average annualized return of over 10% for decades. The past year has seen growth way over this amount and it would be highly unusual for that to continue for a multi-year timeframe.” Regardless of where the market ends up, dividend stocks have strong potential, as demonstrated over the years. During past periods of inflation, dividend stocks performed better compared to other asset classes. Since the 1940s, dividends have accounted for 40% of the market, with this share increasing during times of higher inflation, according to Hartford Funds. The report also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they made up 73% of the market’s returns. Additional studies, including one from Fidelity International, showed that dividends typically grow faster than inflation. Fidelity's research indicated that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth of dividends in the market has outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time. In addition to their considerable impact on overall market returns, dividend stocks provide investors with a way to mitigate risks linked to market volatility. According to DWS Group, over the past 20 years, the monthly volatility of dividend returns was just 0.10%, compared to 3.75% for price returns. The report also noted that despite market fluctuations, investors have seen positive overall returns during this period. While riskier factors played a significant role in these returns, it was the dividend stream that proved to be a more stable and safer option amid the uncertainties of the stock market.

The Dividend Aristocrats Index has grown by just nearly 11% this year, but the outlook for dividend growth among US companies is promising. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, large-cap stocks outperformed many others in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by record earnings and an anticipated record dividend payout for the year. He further added that the market’s large caps are expected to see a 6% increase in dividend payments for 2024, compared with 5.1% in 2023 and 10.8% in 2022. When it comes to dividend investing, investors often prefer companies with a strong track record of dividend growth and solid returns as they help prepare for challenging market conditions. Additionally, investors focus on a company's ability to generate cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet, as these factors support the sustainability of future dividend payouts. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend knights that have outperformed the market in the last three years. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a stock screener and selected dividend companies that have outperformed the market in the past three years. These companies also have strong dividend growth track records under their belt. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey's data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their three-year returns. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Additionally, the guidance for diluted EPS has been increased from $4.06–$4.19 to $4.17–$4.25. On October 30, Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.70%, as of December 5.

Overall CTAS ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend knights that beat the market in the last 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential for CTAS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why is Solid Power, Inc. (SLDP) Among the Best Lithium and Battery Stocks to Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) stands against the other lithium and battery stocks. According to a Reuters report from November 6, automakers are preparing for potential changes under President-elect Donald Trump, including new tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico and the reversal of pro-electric vehicle policies. Trump has indicated plans to rescind EPA and Transportation Department regulations and may reduce or eliminate EV tax incentives. Moreover, the Zero Emission Transportation Association expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump on future EV development. Trump has also warned of tariffs of up to 200% on Mexican vehicles and is considering similar measures for imports from other regions while encouraging foreign automakers to build plants in the US. Additionally, in October, Reuters reported that the European Union approved additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, ranging from 7.8% to 35.3%, on top of the existing 10% duty, in response to what it calls unfair subsidies by China. These tariffs, effective October 30, aim to address concerns over subsidized raw materials, batteries, and financing, with China opposing the decision and calling for negotiations to prevent further trade tensions. China has launched its own probes into EU imports, including pork, dairy, and brandy, potentially retaliating against the EU measures. Chinese EVs currently account for 8% of the EU market, a figure expected to grow to 15% by 2025, with their prices typically 20% lower than European counterparts. The investigation has caused division within the EU, with Germany opposing tariffs while France supports them. GlobalData lowered its 2030 U.S. EV market share forecast from 33% to 28%, citing weakened emissions standards and a focus on lower oil prices after the 2024 elections. Bloomberg reported on November 7 that Mark Wakefield of AlixPartners highlighted that $129 billion in EV investments through 2027 and the $7,500 EV tax credit may be at risk. Automakers are expected to cut EV spending, delay new models, and shift production toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles, like Volkswagen’s adaptation at its South Carolina plant. While reversing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could prove challenging, changes to fuel economy standards are likely, though their impact may not be felt until later in the decade. The lithium market has experienced a huge decline over the past several quarters due to oversupply and lower demand. However, Ana Cabral, Co-Chair & CEO at Sigma Lithium is positive about the future demand for lithium as discussed in a September interview with CNBC. She noted that lithium prices hit a low point in August but have been recovering steadily. The Chinese recovery package, the largest since COVID, has especially boosted the market, as China accounts for more than half of global EV sales. While the U.S. has seen slower EV adoption compared to China and Europe, with growth in China outpacing the U.S. and Europe, the fundamentals remain strong. As China continues to dominate the EV market, it plays a crucial role in driving demand and lithium prices. Regarding other uses of lithium, Cabral emphasized that EV batteries remain the primary driver, especially as automakers shift away from combustion vehicles, which is expected to create further demand in the coming years. Our Methodology For this article, we used stock screeners to identify around 20 lithium and/or battery stocks and chose the 11 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A battery powered electric vehicle charging in a city storefront. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) specializes in solid-state battery technology, focusing on applications in electric vehicles and other sectors. The company is known for its sulfide-based solid electrolytes and licenses its innovative cell designs and manufacturing methods. Its technology improves battery safety and boosts energy density by 50-75% compared to traditional batteries. This positions the company as a key player in industries like EVs, electronics, and aerospace. Solid Power continues to work closely with partners like BMW and SK On, focusing on developing competitive solid-state battery technology for automotive applications. Additionally, the company signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a major battery manufacturer to explore potential collaboration on electrolyte development. It is also strengthening relationships with research institutes in Korea. Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) management highlighted significant milestones in Q3, including the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selecting the company to negotiate a $50 million grant for a project aimed at producing sulfide-based solid electrolyte materials for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). This selection is seen as a validation of Solid Power’s technology and business model. The company is focused on advancing both the performance and manufacturing of its electrolyte products, moving from batch production to a continuous manufacturing process, with the first pilot line planned for installation within the next 12-18 months. By 2026, Solid Power expects to produce 75 metric tons of electrolytes per year, increasing to 140 metric tons by 2028. On the cell side, the company made improvements to its A-2 cell design, aiming for higher performance in safety and energy density, with testing expected in early 2025. Overall SLDP ranks 9th on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SLDP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLDP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Operating in over 100 countries, SQM held an 18% share of the global lithium market in 2023, supplying products to 207 customers across 39 nations, with a strong focus on Asia. Its partnership with Kidman Resources in Australia has further expanded its lithium operations. Moreover, a partnership with Chilean state-owned Codelco, lasting until 2060, aims to improve production and adopt advanced extraction technologies. In Q3, SQM reported solid performance across its business lines in Q3 2024. Specialty Plant Nutrition volumes grew by more than 20%, boosting revenues by 12% year-over-year despite lower prices. Iodine prices showed steady growth due to strong demand and limited supply. In lithium, sales volumes exceeded 51,000 metric tons, an 18% increase from the previous year, though prices declined 24% from the previous quarter due to temporary oversupply. Analysts are also quite optimistic about the long-term prospects for SQM. On November 25, The Fly reported that Scotiabank lowered its price target for SQM shares from $60 to $50 but still rated it as Outperform. The bank sees SQM as the best long-term option among the lithium companies it covers. However, the price target was reduced due to expectations that lithium prices will stay low for a longer period. Overall SQM ranks 10th on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SQM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SQM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:MRVL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. With Trump taking in the reigns soon, steps toward overhauling the US policy have begun. President-elect Trump said on Thursday that he is appointing former Pay Pal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his "White House A.I. & Crypto Czar”. “David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” READ NOW: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Officials such as the crypto czar, a title that is not known to be official, along with other officials in Trump's incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are anticipated to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. lad Gil, an entrepreneur, stated that the choice of Sacks is a "strong move" in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him. In other news, OpenAI has debuted a “research grade” version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company’s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice. “As AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities”. ChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity. Artificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:MRVL) engages in the development and production of semiconductors and is focusing heavily on data centers. On December 4, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised the price target on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) to $130.00, from $90.00, and maintained an “Overweight” rating. The rating follows Marvell’s impressive October quarter results which exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. The company reported sales of $1.52 billion, surpassing the $1.46 billion consensus forecast for its fiscal third quarter. Chief Executive Matt Murphy revealed that the quarter’s growth was largely driven by sales of new custom AI accelerator chips for Amazon and other builders of the so-called hyperscale data centers running today’s huge AI software models. Harlan Sur’s rating is based on this very impressive performance and promising outlook, driven by strong growth in the company’s data center business, particularly in AI ASICs and AI optical DSPs. Not only has the company achieved better-than-expected results, but has also achieved partnerships with major clients like Amazon and Google which strengthens its market position. Moreover, the company’s positive trajectory in its cyclical businesses, along with its anticipated revenue growth from AI, places it for continued earnings growth heading into 2025. Overall MRVL ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. While we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

On December 6, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) was revisited by a Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein who maintained a “Hold” rating along with a $21.00 price target. Sacconaghi has given a hold rating due to mixed signals in its financial outlook. Even though Q4 results slightly exceeded expectations, there remains a cautious outlook due to the pending Juniper acquisition and the modest projection for IT spending in 2025, also leading to a lack of full-year guidance. Moreover, AI server revenues did meet expectations, but there were weak net bookings and a declining AI backlog suggesting challenges ahead. Moreover, HPE had “debooked” a significant portion of server orders, implying potential risks in its order book concentration and customer creditworthiness. Lower R&D spending and weak cash flow compared to income are some more factors for the firm’s cautious approach. Overall HPE ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. While we acknowledge the potential of HPE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other tech stocks. In a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7. The discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer. Looking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors. Her insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment. Methodology We first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant that is well-known for its impactful technologies and has recently made significant strides in the AI landscape. In November, it launched new and improved AI models designed to cater to various industries, enhancing its offerings through the Azure AI model catalog. Recent reports indicate that the company's investments in AI are beginning to yield positive results. In FQ1 2025, which ended on September 30, the company reported $65.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. This was driven by a record quarterly revenue of $38.9 billion from its cloud services, a 22% increase year-over-year. The Azure segment alone achieved a remarkable 33% growth in revenue, due to high demand for AI-driven solutions within its cloud offerings. These developments highlight the effectiveness of its strategy in harnessing AI to boost business outcomes. The company revealed plans to build 3 trusted platforms focused on maximizing the benefits of AI for the business, demonstrating its approach to integrating AI into core business functions. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is at the forefront of AI innovation, with a clear focus on expanding its capabilities through partnerships and product enhancements. It is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions across various sectors, reinforcing its status as a leader in the technology industry. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trump’s favourite index is tipped to rally further in 2025. But will he get in the way?

Donald Trump’s vetting of cabinet picks second time round may have thrown up some blunders, with his nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) this week following the fate of Matt Gaetz’s short-lived candidacy for attorney general. Chad Chronister, currently a Florida sheriff, withdrew his name to run the DEA from consideration – though Trump says he pulled the plug – on Wednesday as a result of uproar among Republicans over his arrest of a pastor in 2020 for holding large services during a Covid lockdown. It follows Gaetz withdrawing his name for lawyer-in-chief last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the band Trump is putting together elsewhere – including hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent being picked as treasury secretary, oil industry veteran Chris Wright as energy secretary, stockbroking firm Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, and Paul Atkins, a free marketeer and crypto-friendly lawyer, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission – has been warmly received at a constituency close to his heart: Wall Street. The stock market, as we learned during Trump’s first term in office, is Trump’s favoured barometer of success – having regularly peppered speeches back then with the question, “How’s your 401(K) doing?” That referred to the stock-laden retirement savings vehicles used by more than 100 million Americans. New York’s S&P 500 index of blue-chip US companies, the world’s most widely followed equities index, has advanced almost 5.5 per cent since Trump outflanked Kamala Harris just over a month ago – bringing its advance so far this year to 28 per cent, and to an all-time high. Investors have committed almost $140 billion (€132.3 billion) of fresh money to US equity funds since the election, with November being the busiest month for inflows on records stretching back to 2000, on hopes the incoming administration will unleash sweeping tax cuts and reforms to help corporate America, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing figures from market data provider EPFR. The S&P 500, which has a major influence on stock markets globally, is on track to reach 6,500 points by the end of next year, according to median forecast of 48 equity strategists recently polled by Reuters. That points to about a 7 per cent advance from current levels. Former Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment have quit the Irish market in the past 15 months and moved their main listings to the US with an aim of ultimately joining the S&P 500. Smurfit Kappa secured direct entry to the index in July when it merged with a US cardboard box-making rival to form Smurfit Westrock. But never has the US market been dominated by so few. The so-called magnificent seven group of high-performing stocks – including Nvidia, the maker of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computer chips, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon – have driven the broader market higher in 2024. Nvidia’s 200 per cent surge alone has fuelled a fifth of the S&P 500’s gain this year. And the seven are seen leading the way again in 2025, according to strategists. There’s a lot of hope priced into equities right now. But investors don’t have to look too far to see red flags. Following this year’s rally, companies on the S&P 500 are trading at an average of 23 times expected earnings, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates. That’s well over the 10-year average of about 18. Tech valuations are even more stretched. Joe Davis, chief economist of Vanguard, the world’s second-largest manager, warned this week that the market had overestimated the short-term potential of AI technology, increasing the risk of a price “correction”. He said some tech valuations were approaching those of 1997 – referring to the tech bubble era. While JP Morgan strategists were upbeat on equities in their 2025 market outlook, published this week, as central banks continue to ease interest rates and the new US administration embarks on a programme of deregulation, they warned of a risk of “disruptive Trump policies triggering a crash landing”. Historically high prices for US housing, crypto currencies (Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Thursday) and gold, as well as low corporate bond market interest rates, relative to risk, broaden the potential fallout. The Central Bank of Ireland highlighted in a report this week that there is a “widening disconnect” between economic uncertainty – also stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and fears about a possible US-China clash over Taiwan – and current low volatility in global equity and debt markets. This increases the chances of a “sharp repricing of assets”, it warned. Trump 2.0, with a return of “America first”, has already seen the president-elect suggest universal tariffs on all goods imported to the US and sharply higher levies on Chinese goods. He has also threatened neighbouring Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent taxes on goods from both unless they stem immigration to the US and flows of drugs. Economists have said tariffs will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to reverse course on its current cycle of easing interest rates. “The effects would be inflationary in the short term – with companies facing higher input costs and consumers paying more for finished goods; [and be] a drag on US GDP in the medium term, while underpinning still-high benchmark interest rates,” said S&P Global Ratings. GDP stands for gross domestic product. Inflation could also be stoked if mass deportations of illegal immigrants kick in – or people start self-deporting in droves – under Trump. Fewer workers in some industries could put upward pressure on wages. Stock market bulls argue Trump will be quick to change course on any economically disruptive policies if they lead to a stock market sell-off. But that won’t prevent volatility in the meantime. And incoming cabinet members should know from the experience of the walking wounded from Trump’s first administration, he’ll always find someone else to blame.

Title: Much-changed Leinster eye Champions Cup winning start against free-flowing Bristol

This Sunday evening opener could be as tough, albeit in a very different way, than the January renewal of hostilities with La Rochelle and it lands on Leinster when they have had the most disruptive preparation of any team in the competition. The net effect of Ireland’s additional autumn match against Australia last week is palpable. In addition to having only a week together again, Leinster are without Hugo Keenan for four weeks due to a wrist injury and James Lowe with a calf strain for an indeterminate amount of time, while Cian Healy and Ryan Baird miss out. Jamie Osborne has also joined their casualty list and after starting all four Irish games and playing 256 and 320 minutes respectively, both Andrew Porter and Caelan Doris are restricted to bench duties. By contrast, two other Irish ever-presents, Joe McCarthy and Josh van der Flier, start their fifth game in five weeks, yet despite the former’s workload and the absence of Keenan and Osborne, RG Snyman and prospective Leinster debutant Jordie Barrett are named on the bench. Both can certainly have a serious impact but even so, the selection of these two stellar names on the bench strongly supports the belief that Leinster are not permitted to start either of them in the Champions Cup. Jack Conan again captains a side showing nine changes in personnel from last weekend’s win in Ulster, with Rónan Kelleher, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park, Sam Prendergast, Robbie Henshaw and Garry Ringrose all return, as does Ciarán Frawley at fullback. The squad trained in Energia Park in Donnybrook on Friday in memory of Dave Fagan, who died this week after a short illness after working with the province as a strength and conditioning coach since 1995 with the senior team, academy and sub-academy. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” admitted Leo Cullen, who first worked under Fagan when he left school. “When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here. We try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” For his part, Pat Lam makes only three changes from last week’s 48-24 win away to Harlequins — virtually the norm for Bristol — in recalling the English pair of Ellis Genge and Harry Randall, and promoting Harry Thacker. Bristol sit second in the Premiership, with five wins and a maximum nine bonus points in seven games. Collectively they have scored the most tries, 36. Individually, left wing Gabriel Ibitoye, with his pace, strength, elusiveness and extravagant offloading, leads the way with six, as does ex-Blackrock pupil and Connacht’s Pro12 winning outhalf AJ MacGinty in the points charts with 75. “Bristol like to keep the ball on the field, they play quick, they play from anywhere, they have an unbelievably strong running game and for us defensively it’s going to be a serious challenge for the 23,” admitted Cullen. “It looks like a very unstructured free-flowing game, but it is very structured in the roles the players would have within that.” Now in his eighth season there, not surprisingly Lam has Bristol singing a tune familiar to Connacht and to his credo that all his players, backs and forwards, must touch the ball over 1,000 times in training every week. Bristol always look to push the pass, keep the ball off the deck and vary the point of attack. They don’t mind conceding 30 so long as they score 40. “They are completely unique,” admits Jacques Nienaber, relishing the challenge. “You won’t find a lot of international teams that will play like that because if you lose [at Test level] it’s written in history. “At club level you can have a little bit of a crack because if you lose a game, you score 30 and they score 31, it’s not as detrimental. It’s not knock-out yet. “But that is why I’m so excited, to try and work out plans for Pat and all the things that he has lined up for us. Listen, they’ve got a bag full of tricks and you can be 21-0 down in 15 minutes if all their stuff sticks and you’re a little bit off your game.” This could be a wild and fluctuating ride, and Leinster will most likely have to roll with a few punches, but they may just have enough forward power and ballast off the bench to come through. BRISTOL BEARS: Rich Lane; Jack Bates, Benhard Janse van Rensburg, Kalaveti Ravouvou, Gabriel Ibitoye; AJ MacGinty, Harry Randall; Ellis Genge, Harry Thacker, Max Lahiff; James Dun, Joe Owen; Santiago Grondona, Fitz Harding (capt), Viliame Mata. Replacements: Gabriel Oghre, Jake Woolmore, Lovejoy Chawatama, Steven Luatua, Benjamin Grondona, Kieran Marmion, Joe Jenkins, Benjamin Elizalde. LEINSTER: Ciarán Frawley; Jordan Larmour, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw, Jimmy O’Brien; Sam Prendergast, Jamison Gibson-Park; Jack Boyle, Rónan Kelleher, Rabah Slimani; Joe McCarthy, James Ryan; Max Deegan, Josh van der Flier, Jack Conan (capt). Replacements: Gus McCarthy, Andrew Porter, Thomas Clarkson, RG Snyman, Caelan Doris, Luke McGrath, Ross Byrne, Jordie Barrett. Referee: Pierre Brousset (France). Forecast: Leinster to win.

Title: Storm Darragh welcomes All-Ireland League back after break with Clontarf heading to Ballynahinch

The effects of Storm Darragh welcome back the Energia All-Ireland League (AIL) after a two-week break, with the first of two significant rounds to be played over the next two weekends before the festive break at the halfway point. Ballynahinch, the somewhat surprising leaders after five successive bonus-point wins, host third-placed Clontarf at Ballymacarn Park where they have not been beaten since April. Just over year ago the sides played out a 24-all draw here, with the recently capped Cormac Izuchukwu among the home try-scorers and Hinch look stronger this season, with hooker Clayton Milligan’s six tries even outnumbering his prolific counterpart Dylan Donnellan on four. They are without Ben Moxham as well as fellow winger Aaron Sexton, who is heading to the USA to pursue a career in the AFL, while Jake Humphreys returns at outhalf. Clontarf are also much changed, with Alex Soroka at number eight, winger Aitzol King and fullback Andrew Smith among those returning and it looks like being another close arm wrestle. UCD are stacked for their match against Terenure at the Belfield Bowl, so much so that Leinster’s match-winner in Ulster, James Culhane, is on the bench, while fellow academy players Ben Brownlee, Diarmuid Mangan, Rory McGuire, Ruben Moloney, Conor O’Tighearnaigh and Alan Spicer all come into the starting XV. Jordan Coghlan’s brace was crucial in Terenure’s 19-12 win last time they met but he is ruled out, albeit ex-Ospreys backrower Will Hickey switches to number eight. Harrison Brewer has overcome his ankle injury and with Chris Cosgrave returning from his trial in Bath to start at fullback, Aran Egan reverts to outhalf. A settled St Mary’s have enjoyed renewing old acquaintances back in 1A this season and, sitting second, they host Young Munster for the first time since February 2018 in a renewal of the famous 1993 shoot-out at Lansdowne Road. Ever since that day, there has always been an edge to this rivalry. To add some extra spice, Conor Hayes (47 points this season) and Dan Goggin (who also has three tries), come up against their former club for the first time. Julian Leszczynski, Young Munster’s leading scorer with 58 points, switches to fullback, with Munster’s Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan combining at halfback and recently contracted Conor Bartley at tight head. Garryowen, bottom of the table, are reinforced by the return of Liam Coombes alongside fellow Munster players Dylan Hicks, Jack Daly, Brian Gleeson, George Hadden and Ronan Foxe, for the visit of Cork Con. The champions recall last season’s leading try-scorer Matthew Bowen, with Sean French moving to 13, and captain David Hyland returns at number eight. Evidently content with Lansdowne’s win over Clontarf last time out, Declan Fassbender has done that rarity in the AIL and named an unchanged side for their tricky trek to City of Armagh who, curiously, have won their last three away but lost their last three at home. Old Belvedere who lead 1B after taking 19 points out of their last 20, meet Shannon at Ollie Campbell Park for the first time since their 46-8 promotion/relegation playoff win last April. The 2A pacesetters Corinthians head to Banbridge without Seán Naughton, in line for his Connacht debut, while close challengers Cashel and Instonians clash at Spafield.

Listen on Sorcha says she knows me. She knows me inside-out. But I tell her that the Rossmeister General still has one or two surprises in his locker. Yeah, no, we’re staying with Sorcha’s old pair in Stoneybosher while the fire damage to our gaff is being fixed and they’ve told us we can decorate their gaff for Christmas. So we’re off to buy a tree and then we’re going to swing into Killiney to collect our baubles and various other bits? Which is actually what we’re orguing about. Sorcha says I’m going to be spending the entire weekend disentangling the lights, but I’m making the point that I didn’t just fock them all into the same box after Christmas last year. Yeah, no, I separated them, then I stretched them out and wrapped each set individually around pieces of, like, cordboard. Sorcha laughs. I’m there, “What’s funny?” She goes, “I remember you saying that you were going to do that? As a matter of fact, you say it every year. But then when it comes to it, you can never be bothered and you end up just throwing them all into the same box for Future Ross to sort out.” “But last Christmas,” I go, “I remember Past Ross thinking, ‘You need to stort being nicer to Future Ross. He’s a genuinely good bloke. Do the dude a solid for once in your life.’ I remember saying that out loud, Sorcha – very clearly.” There’s a “Christmas Trees for Sale” sign on a lamp-post as we’re approaching the junction with Ailesbury Road. Sorcha’s like, “Will we stop here?” But I’m there, “What, Michael’s? I wouldn’t have a Michael’s tree in the house, Sorcha. Even though I’d consider James Ryan a very good friend and obviously Dan Leavy and the Byrne brothers.” She goes, “You see? This is why I’m so dubious about you wrapping the lights. Because you always, always insist on making things hord for yourself.” “That’s not true.” “It’s one hundred per cent true.” “Sorcha, I actually remember very pacifically thinking – and it was the mention of Ross and Harry Byrne there that reminded me – when you’re a ten and you score a try, you have the option of either putting the ball down in the corner, so you can show off your kicking skills with the conversion, or putting it down underneath the posts, just to make it easier on yourself. And I remember thinking, as I was wrapping the lights, ‘You’re basically putting the ball down beneath the posts here, Rossmeister.’” “You’ve suddenly remembered that?” It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby “Yeah, no, I’m like Celine Dion here – it’s all coming back to me now. And then I actually texted Ross Byrne – or I might have sent him a voice note – to tell him what I was doing. Because I’m always saying to him that once you’re a kicker, you never, ever stop thinking like a kicker – and that’s for life. And he came back to me with either a thumbs-up or a smiley face emoji.” “Will we stop at Blackrock College for a tree?” “Not a focking chance. Wouldn’t give them the pleasure.” She’s like, “So where did the cordboard come from?” I’m there, “Excuse me?” “The cordboard. That you supposedly wrapped the lights in.” “I think you’ll find the word is supposably?” “It’s not, Ross.” “Isn’t it? Well, whatever. It would have been cordboard that we had just lying around.” “So you don’t remember where it came from?” “I think it might have been a Corn Flakes box, or – yeah, no, I’m remembering now – it was a Rice Krispies box. Because you know the way I always love a bowl of Rice Krispies on Christmas morning.” “Ross, I really think this is all wishful thinking on your port.” “Excuse me?” “You constantly do this. You tell yourself that you’re going to do something, and you manage to persuade yourself that you’ve done it – even though you haven’t?” “Don’t suppose you’ve any examples of this, Sorcha?” “Yeah, I do. It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby.” “Jesus.” “What?” “You had that one in the chamber, ready to fire, didn’t you?” “And then in January, February, Morch, I would hear you tell people that you were off the booze and absolutely crushing it in the gym. Even though you weren’t.” “So you’re calling me a liar?” “I never thought you were lying. I always thought you’d convinced yourself that it was actually true. I think your enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of your sense of reality.” “Well, brace yourself, Sorcha, because you’re about to be shocked.” We drive the rest of the way in silence. Eventually, we pull into Honalee. There’s, like, five or six workmen out the front of the gaff, having their tea break. Sorcha goes, “My husband is just going to pop up to the attic to get the Christmas lights if that’s okay?” “Don’t mention Christmas lights,” one of the dudes goes. “I spent the whole of last weekend try to untangle the things.” Sorcha’s there, “Well, Ross is convinced that he wrapped them all individually after last Christmas.” The dude actually laughs. He goes, “I always tell myself I’m going to do that. That’s me. Every year.” I decide to block out the voices of the doubters and the naysayers. I tip upstairs, open the attic, clamber up the ladder, switch on the light and find the box. I stare at the lid of it for a good, like, thirty seconds, listening to my own breathing as I prepare to open it. Then I grab the two flaps, tear it open and look inside. Sixty seconds later, I’m carrying the box down the stairs and out to the cor. All of the workmen are standing around waiting to find out whether I actually did wrap the lights or not. “Well?” one of them even goes. I’m there, “Get on with the work, will you? We want to be back in the house before Christmas 2025.” I throw the box on the back seat and Sorcha storts the cor. She doesn’t say anything for a good, like, five minutes, then she goes, “I’ll tell you what, let’s treat ourselves to new Christmas lights this year.” I’m like, “Yeah, no, good idea,” and then I go, “Past Ross is a total dick, by the way.” Ross O’Carroll-Kelly was captain of the Castlerock College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1999.

Title: Christmas dinner wines to get the table talking

Bored drinking the same wine every Christmas? We tend to revert to the same few staples every year: Chablis, Mâcon, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux and one or two other tried-and-trusted favourites. However, there are plenty of other options, wines that might provoke a little conversation around the table. Smooth-textured white wines go nicely with turkey as well as seafood starters. Instead of a chardonnay, this week I suggest a delicious Spanish white made from the godello grape. I tried the Château Thieuley with some smoked salmon I had in the fridge and the two went very well. It might be a bit light for turkey or red meats, though. But you could also try a viognier or an albariño from Spain. I tend to go for lighter red wines with my turkey, usually a Burgundy, a syrah from the Northern Rhône, or a gamay, but I think the Dāo would also do very nicely. If you prefer fuller-bodied wines I would suggest a southern Rhône, Languedoc or Australian grenache-based red that will be low in tannins and therefore great with turkey. If you are catering for a large gang of people, the featured Lidl Grenache would be ideal.

Title: ‘Dave played such a big role’ – Leo Cullen pays tribute to late Leinster S&C stalwart Dave Fagan

Jordie Barrett and head coach Leo Cullen during a Leinster training session at UCD this week. Photo by David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile Sam Prendergast Dave Fagan had a profound influence on the Leinster match-day 23 that arrived in Bristol this morning, and Leo Cullen admitted the death of the club stalwart after an illness had hit the organisation for six. The strength and conditioning coach’s name regularly cropped up in discussions with young Leinster players whose journey as professionals began working with him at the club’s centre of excellence in Donnybrook, where he’d help turn the boys into men. He was as much part of the Leinster furniture as head coach Cullen who yesterday recalled working with the former shot put coach when he was transitioning from Blackrock College into senior rugby in the late 1990s. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” Cullen said yesterday. “We just trained in Energia Park in memory of Dave. When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. “Dave is there since I came out of school. I was explaining to Rabah Slimani on the pitch today about how in the olden days when Mike Ruddock was the head coach and I went in as a 19-year-old, it was a prefab building where the Old Wesley gym is now . . . that’s where we all would have done our training. “Everyone was learning about professionalism and Dave has been involved in Leinster since those days. He was around my whole career and it seems like a long time ago since I played rugby. “He was a great character to have around, a great sounding board for me about young players coming through. He had so much knowledge, he’d seen so much and he could spot them a mile away – the good and bad ones – and it’s such a great skill. “You go into the gym down there and there’s this picture on the wall, Dave takes great pride in the players that step into the senior team. That’s where they all came through, in terms of our home-based players, he was such a big role in that. “It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here, we try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” There are no plans to formally mark Fagan’s passing at Ashton Gate tomorrow, but you sense the squad will feel the need to deliver a performance for the coach. The big news at yesterday’s team announcement was Cullen’s decision to select Sam Prendergast at out-half. There had been plenty of speculation about whether the Kildare youngster would be put in cold storage after starting back-to-back Tests for Ireland, but the head coach conceded his performances in November had moved the dial on selection. “It’s never straightforward. Sam is a young player, he’s very talented. Not just him, you have to make sure the transition is smooth,” he said. “You have to be open-minded . . . listen, we’ve four 10s that can do a really good job for us. They’re all internationals now. Sam wasn’t an international four weeks ago, now he is. “That’s a different conversation in terms of his level of experience and exposure he’s been through, which is fantastic because . . . we could talk about him, but Gus [McCarthy] and Thomas Clarkson as well, we’ve three young players and now they are internationals and that’s great for them to go through because they grow in terms of their confidence. “Hopefully, that’s a positive thing for us as a group. I thought Ross [Byrne] did a great job for the team on Friday night [against Ulster], but we’ve got to be respectful that we’ve a guy who started the last two Tests for Ireland. “We have, when we’re talking about selection, it’s this week. It’s not a call that was made six weeks ago. We can have conversations, but it’s ifs, buts and maybes until we’re sitting down together as a group of coaches saying this is how it’s played out. The three lads coming back, it’s fantastic to have and obviously Sam is one of them.” McCarthy and Clarkson are on a stacked bench that includes Andrew Porter, RG Snyman and Jordie Barrett, who will make his club debut against an in-form Bristol side. Cullen confirmed Hugo Keenan (wrist) and James Lowe (calf) are facing spells on the sidelines, while he said Tadhg Furlong was also a number of weeks away from returning. Pat Lam and his Bristol Bears represent a formidable opening test but Leinster have a cause and they should be too strong. Verdict: Leinster Bristol Bears: R Lane; J Bates, BJ van Rensburg, K Ravouvu, G Ibitoye; AJ MacGinty, H Randall; E Genge, H Thacker, M Lahiff; J Dun, J Owen; S Grondona, F Harding (capt), B Mata.

Title: How Much ‘Magnificent 7’ Companies Spend on Protecting Their CEOs

Time Published: 2024-12-06T22:53:29Z

The shocking killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson this week has shined a light on the security concerns facing corporate leaders and the myriad expenses their companies pay to protect them. Meta (META), for example, shells out a staggering $24.4 million every year on personal security and travel for its CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives. Such costs are appropriate and necessary “in light of the threat landscape,” said the company in its most recent proxy statement. Tesla (TSLA), too, spends millions on security for its CEO Elon Musk, who in recent years has become increasingly concerned about attacks on his wellbeing. The EV maker spent $2.4 million last year to hire a security company for its billionaire leader. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Thompson, who was murdered earlier this week in New York City, headed an insurance subsidiary of UnitedHealth. The parent company didn’t break out any details regarding executive security perks in its 2023 proxy statement, although it noted that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty is required to use corporate aircraft during business travel for security reasons. Security costs across S&P 500 companies have risen substantially in recent years, according to data from Equilar, an executive data compensation research firm. The median value of security expense perks doubled from $47,643 in 2021 to $98,069 by 2023, with the share of companies providing such arrangements for named executive officers increasing by 23.5 percent to 27.5 percent. Here’s a look at what some of the world’s largest tech companies spend on security expenses for their top executives: Meta, the highest S&P 500 spender on executive security perquisites, spent most of its security-related $24.4 million expenses in 2023 on CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He received $9.4 million in costs related to personal security at his residences and during personal travel, in addition to a pre-tax allowance of $14 million to cover additional personal security costs for Zuckerberg and his family. Meta also paid for security for a handful of other of other executives, including $903,139 for chief operating officer Javier Olivan. In 2023, Google (GOOGL)’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) spent almost $6.8 million on personal security services for Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. This makes the tech company the second biggest S&P 500 spender for the year on security perk expenditures, according to Equilar. Amazon (AMZN) spent a grand total of nearly $2.7 million in 2023 on security arrangements for executives including Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Douglas Herrington and Adam Selipsky. Security costs totaled at $1.6 million for Bezos, the company’s founder and executive chair, and $986,164 for CEO Jassy. The company also spent $22,631 on security for Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, and $51,636 on Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nvidia (NVDA) shelled out nearly $2.5 million in fiscal 2024 for its CEO Jensen Huang. These costs included $2.2 million residential security and consultation fees for Huang, in addition to security monitoring services and car and driver services. Apple (AAPL) spent around $820,000 last year on personal security services for its CEO Tim Cook. The company also spent more than $1.6 million on air travel expenses for Cook, a fee that included hourly flight charges, fuel charges, departure fees and landing fees. Due to Apple’s “global profile” and “the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO,” Cook is required to use private aircrafts for all business and personal travel. In December 2023, Tesla paid a security company owned by its CEO Elon Musk to provide services to Musk himself. These expenses totaled $2.4 million in 2023 and around $500,000 through February of this year, according to Tesla’s filings. Musk in July said in a post on his social platform X that two separate people had tried to kill him in the past eight months before they were arrested. In fiscal year 2024, Microsoft (MSFT) put $58,291 towards security-related costs and personal travel expenses for its CEO Satya Nadella. Providing such security services enables top executives “to focus on their duties to Microsoft while reducing security threats, and therefore, mitigate risks to our business,” said the company in a recent filing.

The crypto industry is excited about a second Trump presidency. by Ellen Ioanes and Nicole Narea The price of bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, continuing a post-election run buoyed by the pro-crypto promise of the incoming Trump administration. On Election Day, bitcoin — one of the most popular decentralized digital assets available — was worth $69,374, according to the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase. Within a month, it had spiked more than 44 percent. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and XRP also shot up during that period. Cryptocurrencies’ sudden increase in value is a sign of investor optimism about President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and those of his picks to head several key regulatory agencies, some of whom have explicitly promised deregulation of the crypto industry. “That bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark reflects the expectation of both political support and regulatory latitude under the incoming administration,” said Ramaa Vasudevan, an economics professor at Colorado State University who has been critical of crypto. “The nomination of crypto-enthusiasts for administrative posts is a clear signal of the embrace of bitcoin and crypto triggering the flood of money into these markets.” Bitcoin’s rally is also a product of its increased legitimacy. Trump’s election may have sparked its rally, but the financial establishment’s embrace of the asset in recent months provided the tinder. While bitcoin was once a niche curiosity, it is now a mainstream digital currency that everyday Americans can now buy through reputable retail investment accounts. Even if bitcoin ultimately turns out to be a bubble, as many economists have argued it may, these investment vehicles have assured it some staying power. Trump has been an ardent cryptocurrency supporter throughout his most recent presidential campaign, and his choices to lead key government agencies related to its regulation reflect that enthusiasm. Bitcoin hit its highest valuation ever following the nomination of Paul Atkins on Wednesday to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is in charge of regulating tradable securities like stocks. Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner for six years during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Atkins is “not necessarily the sort of burn-it-all-down type of nominee that Trump has decided upon for other positions,” Molly White, a cryptocurrency researcher and critic, told Vox. “He’s fairly establishment; he has the SEC background, but he also was a very strong advocate for deregulation when he was in the SEC and certainly since then.” Atkins is also a co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance, an industry lobbying group that advocates for lax regulation of cryptocurrencies. Perianne Boring, the CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, is rumored to be one of Trump’s top picks for another key position: head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which makes rules around the trading of futures and commodities. Currently, cryptocurrency is under the purview of the SEC, but the Trump administration is reportedly weighing regulating it as a commodity instead. If that change is made, cryptocurrency would come under the purview of the CFTC, which is often seen to be more hands-off in its approach to regulation. Billionaire crypto enthusiast David Sacks, whom Trump named Thursday as his crypto and AI czar, will be tasked with helping formulate crypto and AI policy from the White House. In that role, Trump said in a post on Truth Social, Sacks will work closely with both the SEC and CTFC to develop a legal framework to regulate crypto. Trump himself is also connected to cryptocurrency via his family’s cryptocurrency and trading venture World Liberty Financial. Pro-cryptocurrency groups spent $245 million in this year’s elections, more than any other industry, to support candidates across the country seen as friendlier to crypto. All of that likely means that the regulatory landscape under a Trump administration will be much friendlier for crypto following heavier regulations and a slew of lawsuits against crypto companies during current SEC chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. “The recent wave of investment in the crypto space is largely driven by the growing belief that years of regulatory uncertainty and lawfare may finally be giving way to clarity,” said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab. Gensler’s SEC cracked down on trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, arguing that the buying and selling of cryptocurrency should have the same oversight as something like a stock or bond, and that investors should have access to the same kinds of information about crypto companies as they would have about a company that they are buying stock in. Crypto trading platforms and associated companies, however, argue that crypto tokens aren’t the same as stocks and therefore shouldn’t have the same regulations applied. The SEC has brought lawsuits against several major crypto platforms, including Coinbase, which are ongoing. But they could be dropped under the Trump administration, and regulation around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to change significantly under Trump. Under a Trump regulatory regime, cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could operate with less threat of litigation, making it easier for people to trade on their platforms. Enthusiasts say this will spur innovation in the industry, but it could also mean that individual traders using such platforms are more exposed to fraud, theft, and the volatile nature of the currency. Over the past five years, and particularly following the downfall of crypto trading platform FTX in 2022, the narrative around cryptocurrency’s utility has changed. Now, it’s being touted more as an investment instrument rather than a form of currency that can be used like cash, White said. And that pivot is also helping its valuation. In January, the SEC gave the green light to the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) in the US. ETFs are baskets of financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum) that are bought and sold on a regulated stock exchange. ETFs offer anyone indirect access to cryptocurrency, if they choose to invest. Put simply, if the value of bitcoin increases, so does the value of these ETFs — but because of the bundled nature of ETFs and their presence on a regulated exchange, investors are more insulated from loss if bitcoin’s value declines. Firms including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest have rolled out bitcoin funds, which offer new investors, especially those who might be more risk-averse, easy ways to purchase or gain exposure to cryptocurrency. Previously, investors had limited options for trading bitcoin. They could go on a cryptocurrency exchange to directly buy bitcoin, but then would have to figure out how to safely and conveniently store it long-term. (Cryptocurrency held on an exchange can be vulnerable to theft, while crypto stored offline is safer but difficult to trade.) They could also invest in risky bitcoin futures, agreeing to buy or sell the currency at a later date at a certain price. Now, ETFs offer an establishment-backed option. “While no one can predict the exact inflection point or when the price will stabilize, the long-term driver of bitcoin’s rise is its evolution — not just as digital gold, but as a foundational layer of global financial infrastructure,” Catalini said. However, Vasudevan said that there is still reason to believe that crypto’s climb won’t last forever. Bitcoin has surged before, only to crash precipitously. In November 2022, bitcoin’s value dropped 20 percent, to below $16,000, in a matter of days after the spectacular downfall of the crypto exchange FTX. The concern remains that the price of crypto is based purely on speculation, rather than any inherent value. “This has all the makings of another bubble, one that is being stoked by the prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment and the possibilities it is opening for new products and funds that can draw in more and more people into these markets,” Vasudevan said.

Title: What Arm’s CEO makes of the Intel debacle
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315123/arm-ceo-rene-haas-intel-ai-chips-samsung-changes
Time Published: 2024-12-06T21:45:26Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Arm CEO Rene Haas has a unique, bird’s eye view of the tech industry. His company’s chip designs are in the majority of devices you use on a daily basis, from your smartphone to your car. The SoftBank-backed company he leads is worth almost $150 billion, which is now considerably more than Intel. With the news earlier this week that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger “retired” and Intel is evaluating its options for a possible spinoff or outright sale, I wanted to hear what Haas thought should happen to his longtime frenemy. There were reports that he approached Intel about buying a big chunk of the company before Gelsinger was ousted. At the same time, Arm is also rumored to be eyeing an expansion into building its own chips and not just licensing its designs. Haas and I touched on all that and more in an exclusive interview earlier today, which will air in full on a future episode of Decoder. (You can listen to my episode about AI spending in the enterprise that just came out as well.) In the meantime, I wanted to give subscribers the first peek at the highlights from my conversation with Haas. The following interview has been edited and condensed: On what he makes of the Intel situation: As someone who has been in the industry my whole career, it is a little sad to see what’s happening… Intel is an innovation powerhouse. At the same time, you have to innovate in our industry. There are lots of tombstones of great tech companies that don’t reinvent themselves. I think Intel’s biggest dilemma is how to disassociate being either a vertical company or a fabless company, to oversimplify it. That is the fork in the road that they’ve faced for the last decade. Pat [Gelsinger] had a strategy that was very clear that vertical was the way to win. In my opinion, when he took that strategy on in 2021, that was not a three-year strategy. That was a five-to-10-year strategy. He’s gone and there’s a new CEO to be brought in and the decision has to be made. My personal bias says that vertical integration is a pretty powerful thing. If they could get that right, I think they would be in an amazing position. But the cost associated with it is so high that it may be too big of a hill to climb. I’m not going to comment on the rumors that we wanted to buy them. But I think, again, if you’re a vertically integrated company and the power of your strategy is in the fact that you have a product and you have fabs, inherently, you have a potential huge advantage in terms of cost versus the competition. When Pat was the CEO, I did tell him more than once, “You ought to license Arm because if you’ve got your own fabs, fabs are all about volume and we can provide volume.” I wasn’t successful in convincing him to do that. On the rumors that Arm will build its own AI chips: If you’re defining a computer architecture and you’re building the future of computing, one of the things you need to be very mindful of is that link between hardware and software in terms of really understanding where the tradeoffs are being made, where the observations are being made, what are the ultimate benefits to consumers from a chip that has that type of integration. That is easier to do if you’re building something than if you’re licensing IP… If you’re building something, you’re much closer to that interlock, and you have a much better perspective in terms of the design tradeoffs to make. So, if we were to do something, that would be one of the reasons. On Arm’s ongoing lawsuit with Qualcomm: The current update is that it plans to go to trial on December 16th, which isn’t very far away. I can appreciate — because we talk to investors and partners — that what they hate the most is uncertainty. But on the flip side, I would say the principles as to why we filed the claim are unchanged. On Sam Altman’s prediction that AGI will arrive in 2025: I know he has his own definitions for AGI and his reasons for those definitions. I don’t subscribe so much to what is AGI versus ASI [artificial superintelligence]. I think more around when these AI agents start to think and reason and invent. To me, that is a bit of a “cross the Rubicon” moment… If you would have asked me this question a year ago, I would have said it’s quite a ways away. You ask that question now, [and] I say it is much closer. On David Sacks being named President-elect Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar: Kudos to him. I think that’s a pretty good thing. It’s quite fascinating that if you go back eight years to Trump 1.0, in terms of where we were in December as he was starting to fill out his Cabinet choices and appointees, it was a bit chaotic. At the same time, there wasn’t a lot of representation from the tech world. This time around, whether it’s Elon [Musk], whether it’s David [Sacks], whether it’s Vivek [Ramaswamy] — I know Larry Ellison has been very, very involved in terms of discussions with the administration — I think it’s a good thing. Having a seat at the table and having access to policy, I think, is really good. Big leadership changes hit Samsung Electronics this week, per an internal memo I’ve obtained. North America CEO KS Choi is out and has been replaced by Yoonie Joung, a 33-year company veteran. Dave Das now solely oversees the mobile business while former co-head Brent Yoo is heading to Brazil to run sales there. And Shane Higby now runs the following divisions: Home Entertainment, Display, and Digital Appliance. There were a bunch of other shuffles at the C-level, but those are the highlights. Samsung has been restructuring across the board for months now and did layoffs in Choi’s division at the end of September, so this week’s news isn’t really a surprise. Perhaps the company hasn’t announced this news externally yet because its Korean investors will be meeting in the US next week (a company rep didn’t have a comment by press time). “Our sales have been down, especially in consumer electronics,” one company insider tells me. “My guess is that we’re just not hitting our targets quarter-over-quarter and so he [Choi] had to go.” It was fascinating to be in the audience at the DealBook Summit for the first public interview Jeff Bezos has done in years. While I maybe should have been expecting it, I was still shocked at how much he gushed about Donald Trump and his archnemesis for Blue Origin, Elon Musk. Another part of the interview that stood out was when Bezos said he is spending a lot of time at Amazon, “95-percent” of which is focused on AI. This week, Amazon announced its Nova family of foundational AI models at AWS re:Invent — a project I first scooped in this newsletter earlier this year. Amazon is obviously still playing catch-up in the AI race, but it seems to have closed meaningful ground with Nova. If anything, this week shows how quickly the AI race is still shifting. It feels like any of the big players could leap ahead at any moment. Even if you’re an AI skeptic, that’s pretty exciting.

Title: Why Is The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG) Among The Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) stands against the other advertising stocks. Ad spending in 2024 received a significant boost from recurring events such as the US election and the Olympics, and experts believe that these spending patterns are likely to add billions to the market. Media agency Magna increased its US ad spending forecast for the year, expecting revenue growth of 11.4% to $377 billion, per the news shared with Marketing Dive. The company expects non-cyclical ad spending to grow by 8.9%, reflecting a rise from 8.2% in previous forecasts. This marks one of the best performances for the category in 20 years. This revision stemmed from improved macroeconomic conditions, healthy appetites in digital and streaming, and cyclical events, such as the elections and the Summer Olympics. As per PwC, fueling revenue growth by selling E&M products directly to users is challenging. Of the 3 major categories i.e., consumer spending, connectivity, and advertising, consumer spending is the smallest and slowest growing. The connectivity category i.e., fixed and mobile services, topped US$1.1 trillion in 2023. Advertising outpaced consumer spending in 2023 and should top US$1 trillion in 2026. PwC believes that it is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR through 2028. With advertising expected to make up ~55% of total E&M industry growth over the upcoming 5 years, PwC believes that it will become a more important part of companies’ business models. For strategic reasons, all participants in the E&M industry are required to be more skillful at selling ads. According to PwC, the changes to the way businesses approach the ad business are expected to be seen in 3 key areas. Firstly, the monetization of data is expected to fuel more sophisticated advertising models. Next, the connection will be closer between the discovery of products and services and their purchase and consumption. Finally, it will be important for companies to understand how global privacy regulations impact growth. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per Mediatool, key advertising trends to look out for include an emphasis on authenticity, visual content domination, integration of AI, mobile-centric campaigns, and growth of social commerce. AI/ML has become important in the world of digital advertising. As of now, 32% of marketers leverage AI for creating, managing, and optimizing their ads. According to Market.us, the global AI in advertising market is expected to reach $28.4 billion in the year 2033 with a CAGR of 28.4%. This was valued at $6.7 billion in the year 2023. Based on the application, targeted advertising dominated the broader market with a share of 31.1% in 2023. Our Methodology To list the 15 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 25-28 stocks, we selected the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A modern advertising billboard promoting a company's services in the cityscape. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) offers advertising and marketing services. The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG)’s stock has been on analysts’ radar as they believe that the impact of significant account losses might weigh on the company’s future performance. The account losses, which include the loss of Amazon’s media account, might create a headwind on revenue and margins. Furthermore, losses of creative revenues from Pfizer and GM are likely to impact the company’s 2025 performance. However, industry experts opine that The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) is now well-placed to turn tides and might now witness a revival. This is because of its focus on several strategic initiatives targeting to improve its competitive position and fuel future growth. The company continues to emphasize key areas like Retail Media, Data, Generative AI (GenAI), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and production improvements. The retail media sector continues to rapidly expand, with retailers developing their own advertising platforms, providing The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) a chance to capture a growing market. By developing expertise in this area, the company will be well-placed in a high-growth segment of the advertising industry. Likewise, the integration of GenAI technologies into service offerings will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its creative output and provide more sophisticated data-driven insights to clients. Overall IPG ranks 2nd on our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of IPG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than IPG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 6 Top Undervalued Stocks To Buy In December 2024

getty With one interest rate cut in September and more likely on the way, 2025 could be a standout year for consumer spending. World Data Lab has projected next year's global consumer spending will reach $3.2 trillion. That translates to growth of almost 6%, fueled by 131 million new consumers. If the growth materializes, consumer discretionary stocks—and their shareholders—will benefit. That means it may be time to increase your exposure to the consumer discretionary sector. Even better, you can make the move with one of the potentially undervalued stocks introduced below. I picked the six top undervalued stocks for December by screening on these criteria: Note that these best stock picks are concentrated in one sector, so they are not intended to represent a diversified portfolio. They are presented as options for investors who want to capitalize on falling interest rates in 2025 and the positive effect that trend may have on consumer confidence.

For smaller companies, see our small-cap value stock picks. You may also want to reference our list of value stocks for 2024. Amazon generates revenue from several sources. They include online and store-based retail sales in the U.S. and globally, online advertising, Amazon Prime memberships, logistics and support services for retailers and cloud computing. Since Amazon's third-quarter earnings release, at least 15 analysts have raised their AMZN price targets. The headlining takeaway from the release was 19% quarter-over-quarter growth in the AWS cloud computing business, attributed to strong AI infrastructure demand. AWS is faster-growing and higher-margin than retail sales for Amazon. However, e-commerce, including Prime memberships, still provides most of the company's revenue. Amazon is also the market share leader in U.S. e-commerce sales. Globally, the company accounts for 12% of gross merchandise volume sold online. With that positioning, Amazon should benefit from any measurable uptick in consumer spending. Like Amazon, Alibaba operates a diversified business model that includes e-commerce sales, display advertising, logistics and delivery services and cloud computing. The company is based in China and generates more than half of its revenue from retail e-commerce in its home country. At least five analysts have raised their price targets on Alibaba since the company's last earnings release. Others reiterated their targets and two lowered them. Alibaba also grew its cloud computing revenues, but growth in the company's international digital commerce group was much stronger. Revenues there were up 32% quarter over quarter. The division includes retailers AliExpress and Trendyol plus wholesale site Alibaba.com. One risk to note for Alibaba is the uncertain state of the Chinese economy. Recent stimulus efforts by the Chinese government have helped China's financial markets but consumer confidence remains low. Lululemon produces athletic apparel, footwear and accessories, with an emphasis on technical fabrics and functional designs. The company has deep roots in the yoga community. Products are sold through third-party retailers and directly to consumers via lululemon.com and company-owned stores. Analysts' reactions to Lululemon's last earnings report were mixed, with more target price reductions than increases. While the company beat earnings expectations, it missed on revenue. In 2024, LULU is down 37%. Investors have been worried about rising competition in the luxury athleisure space and the departure of the company's Chief Product Officer Sun Choe. Despite those issues, analysts largely still see upside for the apparel maker, particularly at the lower trading price. If the company can keep its line-up relevant and compelling, it should benefit from increasing consumer confidence next year.

The brand portfolio includes UGG, Hoka, Teva, Koolaburra and ANHU. The products are sold to customers around the world, online and through company-owned retail stores and third-party retailers. Deckers Outdoor has been handily beating analysts' revenue and earnings expectations for several quarters running. The latest earnings release outpaced EPS expectations by more than 28%, prompting several analysts to raise their price targets. DECK stock is up nearly 50% for the year on double-digit revenue gains plus a rising gross margin. Given the five-year EPS growth outlook of 64%, many believe DECK's impressive results will continue in the intermediate term. SharkNinja makes a range of lifestyle products under the Shark and Ninja brand names. Shark products include vacuums and hair styling tools. The Ninja line-up features cookware and small kitchen appliances, such as air fryers and beverage makers. Products are sold online and through third-party retailers. Like Deckers Outdoor, SharkNinja has made a habit of beating expectations recently. Highlights of the company's last earnings release included 33% net sales growth versus the prior-year quarter and a 160-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin. SharkNinja's success is related in part to its ability to innovate solutions and launch products faster than competitors, according to JPMorgan analysts. The company routinely announces new products and line expansions as it works to optimize the supply chain. Investors like the balance of topline growth with expense control. SN stock is up nearly 80% on the year. Skechers designs, makes and sells footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. The company sells to retailers, marketplaces and directly to consumers (DTC). The DTC channels are skechers.com and a chain of retail stores. In its latest earnings release, Skechers reported 15.9% sales growth and 35.5% diluted EPS growth. The company also raised its full-year revenue and EPS outlook. One negative in the quarter was an 80-basis-point gross margin decline due to lower average selling prices. Despite the raised guidance and several analyst price target increases, SKX stock has not moved much since the late-October release. Given the upside and the generally bullish outlook on the company's five-year earnings outlook, now may be the time to buy. A 2025 uptick in consumer spending could deliver a nice lift to consumer discretionary stocks that already have business momentum. If you are ready to claim your piece of the potential profits, retailers like Amazon and Alibaba plus brand portfolios such as Decker Outdoors and SharkNinja, bought at the right price, could be perfect choices.

Ooredoo is urgently seeking to acquire additional data centers to house Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) latest artificial intelligence chips, as highlighted by its chief executive, Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Supported by the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, the telecom company is aggressively increasing the capacity of its data centers and using strategic alliances to meet the rising demand for artificial intelligence-driven products. In June Ooredoo signed a major alliance with Nvidia to help this objective, therefore gaining access to the latest-generation graphics processing units. These GPUs will be housed across Ooredoo's 26 data centers spread throughout Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Tunisia, and the Maldives. By means of this alliance, Nvidia marks its first significant artificial intelligence deployment in the MENA area, therefore gaining access to markets from North Africa to South Asia. According to The Wall Street Journal, Ooredoo wants to employ these powerful Nvidia processors to meet the fast growing need for enhanced computing infrastructure, especially for generative artificial intelligence technology. Ooredoo has struggled to create new data centers fast enough to satisfy the growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure notwithstanding the strategic cooperation. The Wall Street Journal claims that right now the corporation is concentrating on acquisitions as a more practical way to handle these problems. Complementing its present 40-megawatt capacity, Ooredoo has pledged $1 billion to increase the capacity of its data center by another 2025 megawatts. With an eye toward giving governments, businesses, and startups throughout the region access to innovative AI resources, Ooredoo intends to almost treble its data center capacity by the end of the decade. Apart from its alliance with Nvidia, Ooredoo's Indonesian division, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, worked with GoTo Gojek Tokopedia in November to introduce Sahabat-AI, an AI language model ecosystem meant to support Indonesian languages. Designed in association with AI Singapore and Tech Mahindra, this project trains and improves AI skills using Nvidia's AI Enterprise platform. Along with its alliances, Ooredoo's strategic emphasis on data center acquisitions shows its dedication to propel digital transformation and innovation all throughout the MENA area. Using Nvidia's cutting-edge technologies and growing data center footprint will help Ooredoo position itself as a major participant in the AI and digital transformation scene and satisfy the fast growing needs for AI infrastructure.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. The US labor market rebounded from an October swoon, adding more jobs than expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2%.

If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%.

Title: Bitcoin is the ultimate new luxury? ￼

Time Published: 2024-12-06T13:51:50Z

Best way to convince someone or people to do something is not to praise its virtues, but to promote the idea that in fact it is a luxury? For example, living a spartan and aesthetic lifestyle, it is not self abnegation in you’re not positively doing self harm, but instead, it is the new luxury to be Spartan, disconnected, off the grid etc. In fact, what is the best way to Schwab or brag? Not to brag or show off how much stuff you owe or whatever… But instead, bragging and showing off the fact that in fact, you don’t check or use email for a living? Or use email at all? Invisible wealth. Very interesting things; if you are in fact a really really really truly rich person the question is: do you in fact want people to know in real life that in fact, you are really rich? Of course not! Then everyone is going to try to sneakily get at you and your wealth, and also, rob or hijack or jack you. For Example, what is the best way to get dropped? Going to the club with the Rolex on your left wrist; you could identify a Rolex watch from a mile away based on the chain-link pattern, the way it shines and glistens. As a consequence, the funny thing with wealth is a little bit ironic and bizarre; First, what do you want to signal? Do you want to signify your wealth of prestige and power? Or would you prefer to stay low-key? For example, once again when it comes to cars and automobiles; it is generally not a good idea to be known. For example, all the real Hollywood producers and people who run and own the media, all of them desire to be unknown. Why? They want to be able to go out in public, enjoy their lives, go on a walk without getting mobbed, without the paparazzi following them everywhere. I have a funny theories; actors and directors are essentially sacrificial lamb; or scapegoats; they are promised all this wealth power and prestige but in fact, they end up just becoming targets for the Hollywood producers who have the real wealth and power and prestige. The true Hollywood producers then, can enjoy the upside of their anonymity, proceeded in life as usual, without getting their lives ruined by TMZ. So, the general idea; so how can you store your wealth, hide your wealth, without anybody knowing it? And without inciting the envy of your neighbors, other people, etc.? First, not driving a flashy car. If you know somebody who is a real millionaire or a bitcoin billionaire or whatever, and they still drive a Toyota Prius, know that they’re onto something good. Second, ultimate self clothing. If you are a real connoisseur, you are going to be wearing only cashmere, wool, Merino wool, the finest of materials, all without letters or stitching or monograms or logos. Why? Because once again certainly there is a grand upside to having better materials, superior materials to keep you warm and cozy, and protected from the elements. For example, in the winter time, when it is really really cold and miserable outside, your best bet is wool and cashmere. Not some loser Louis Vuitton something. And also, leather. Leather is very very simple and also a grand and great luxury. As much as these loser animal rights activist may say otherwise; leather is superior and supreme. Even a random Prada iPad case which I was gifted at this one Prada pop-up show, Which was used on the original iPad, which hilariously still fits my new iPad Pro M4 chip, it feels so luxurious so inside, once again, pure leather is the way. So the big issue here is that eco-friendly stuff doesn’t last, the quality is poor, the durability is poor. It sucks in almost every single regard. I have a theory; the only reason you have a lot of these companies trying to promote ￼ eco-friendly stuff in eco-friendly materials because they are all essentially derivatives of plastic, recycled plastic and polyester, which is hard cheaper to produce, create, market and sell, and also it has much higher profit margins. Therefore we are being suckered into using really really bad materials, all for the sake of fattening their wallets, not for the planet. In fact, if you think about it, a lot of these materials are made out of petroleum and oil, and I don’t even think they disintegrate that well, whereas if you have a leather or something, not only will that last for generations, in theory it should decompose better in the Earth than some sort of junky plastic. Even funny enough when you see these sci-fi movies of the future, they are not wearing these recycled polyester suits, most of the people in Blade Runner or whatever are wearing leather jackets, just like a Ryan Gosling from Blade Runner 2049. Once again, leather jacket, Cow and or sheep fur lining. Even in the early days of aviation, a lot of these aviation pilots were very very thick sheep fleet interior jackets, and thick leather high jackets gloves hats etc. to keep them warm. Back in the days before all of this nonsense call eco-friendly fashion, which is once again, consumerism with a good conscience. I think what a lot of fools don’t understand is that in fact, bitcoin may be the best thing for the planet in the human race. Why? It lasts forever. Not 100 years not 1000 years, try 100,000 years. As long as a human race exist, on earth space from Mars or even on a spaceship with intergalactic Internet, Bitcoin shall last. In fact, if I was jumping on a spaceship and getting ready to settle to Mars, or thinking about Seneca’s kids kids kids kids kids, certainly it seems plausible that rather than taking US dollars, Fiat currency, gold bars, or Lamborghinis with them to space, certainly they will take bitcoin which is real, yet weightless. Of course you have seen the campuses, you have seen the playgrounds, you have seen the mediocre Google pixel devices;; yet, have you ever seen a search engine in real life? People that might talk about the Google data centers, but you fools don’t you know that the bitcoin monetary network is like taking all the data centers but Amazon Google Facebook meadow whatever and combined it times 10? Or like having 20 full on nuclear reactors powering it? So bitcoin just broke $103,000 a bitcoin the other day, December 5, 2024… A day not to forget, also my mom’s birthday. So the first thought is why did it pop so hard? I think it is because at a world economic Russia forum, Vladimir Putin himself commented and said that bitcoin is unstoppable, you cannot stop two human beings from sending electronic payments or stuff between one another with their phones, and that it was wise to adopt new technologies as they came. And also, Russia is in a bit of a squeeze; they kind of know they are dependent on America, and now with the war with Ukraine, they are slowly getting squeezed out of the picture. And as a consequence, how can the Russian store their wealth? Maybe in gold bars, but gold bars are not very practical for transferring billions of dollars of value instantly across the planet. For example if you are Russia with $100 billion of gold bars, trying to do commerce with mainland China… How many military vehicles do you employed to securitize the gold, to prevent pirates from stealing it? And very very interesting on a recent interview that Michael Saylor had with yahoo news, is that actually, in terms of American technological supremacy, and monetary supremacy, America should just immediately sell all of her gold reserves, and just buy bitcoin instead, ideally buying up at least 20% of the world‘s bitcoin monetary network. Why? This would immediately demonetize gold, which is once again, the reserve asset which our enemies use. So then there would be a double win-win situation; first, America is still able to assert her US dollar dominance on the planet, against all of the BRICS nations, and also, become the central superpower, ideally forever in the context of money power and capital? ￼ kind of a funny observation; I’ve actually discovered there are a bunch of Eric’s in the bitcoin world, ERIC Semmler of semler scientific, the company which is also on the bitcoin standard, also ERIC Trump who I guess is one of the sons of Donald Trump, who is also apparently really into bitcoin, also, another ERIC in Bloomberg who writes about ETFs, there’s a lot of us. Anyways, as of late I’ve had a stronger conviction, telling all my close friends and family that actually care for to get themselves and their family and their portfolios onto the bitcoin standard. This means like putting all your wealth into bitcoin, and for stocks and retirement IRA Roth IRA whatever, putting it all into microstrategy MSTR stock. I’ve been giving a lot of young family members unsolicited advice about microstrategy, and they were all grateful because it went up a lot! Everyone is always feeling like they missed the boat, but as long as you buy it for less than $1 million, you’re still going to get a 90% discount. And also, a funny and simple thought is that similarly speaking, I can also imagine that I’ll be buying bitcoin even when it is $1 million of bitcoin and beyond. I’m also certain I will be buying bitcoin when it is $10million a bitcoin, and maybe even when it is $100 million a bitcoin. So bitcoin is really interesting to me because it is the world’s first hard money and capital. Typically capital has been parked in real estate for so long because for the most part it was scarce, desirable, and also resistant to traditional fiat currency. For example, in the past, if you parked all of your capital into US dollars, or the Dutch guilder, you would have effectively senior wealth go down to zero. I saw an advertisement that in 1920 you could purchase a home in Culver City for $250, and now it is worth what, $2.1 million dollars? So this is also $1 million question or maybe $1 trillion question or 100 trillion or a $350 trillion question: How can you monetize bitcoin? It’s kind of like the same of saying that if I bought Manhattan in the year 1624, how can I collect to rent from it? Or, like imagine in the early days the Internet, nobody had any idea how to make money off of it. Even the early days of Google, I still remember finding Google and finding about Google in a search engine engines for dummies book when I was around like 11 or 12 years old, And it was a simple search engine, just the Google search icon, and I’m feeling lucky button. It seems that maybe like 15 years later they found out ways to make money through search advertisements. Same with Facebook, it’s pretty impressive, that Mark Zuckerberg was able to take some sort of college prank, and transform it into billions of dollars of value. Once again same thing with advertising. So I think with bitcoin it will be the same. They will be very very easy ways for people to monetize bitcoin, but just give it some time! Why in such a hurry or rush? So you should certainly not touch your bitcoin for at least four years, 10 years, ideally never. Why? Do not trade your gold for copper, no matter how good the trade may seem. So for example, people still have this foolish idea that when bitcoin is up you should sell it and buy something “real“, like real estate or a single-family home or property or US dollars whatever. These fools are still stuck in the days of AOL 3.0, 38.8 K tile up Internet, blockbuster and the like. Michael Saylor also had an interesting history of science analogy; imagine that only bicycles existed and boom, somebody comes out with a motorcycle Ducati. Certainly there is no turning wings of time back. Or let us say that you were in the 1920s, and everyone is driving this horse and carriage buggy whips, or Ford model T’s. If this is the case, imagine then somebody pulls up with a cyber truck, all Matte black, certainly people would think that you’re some sort of alien or god. ￼ So imagine that God came from heaven, he came down to earth, and told us: I shall give you the most supreme and sublime money in capital. It shall be immortal, infinitely divisible, portable, it will last and live forever on the Internet in the cloud, both online and off-line, it will be censorship resistant, it will be politically neutral; and, you could just memorize the password in your head, and hand down the password to your descendants to own forever as long as they just remember the words. Wouldn’t this be like the best invention of all time? I watch a funny film called God bless bitcoin, and the similar idea was that there are some religious folks who believe that from even a religious perspective, it is ethical. Jewish people, Islamic people, and Christian people all like it. A good sign. I think the only people who don’t like bitcoin are essentially the people who are still stuck in the old ways. For example, your uncle who still refuses to use an iPhone, and prefers his Motorola razor flip-phone instead. Or, your grandma who is still used to going to blockbuster to borrow VHS cassettes to watch at home, on her CRT television, with the VCR player, and also with a little Ferrari rewinding VHS cassette thing. So for example, it took me a very very long time for me to explain to my mom what cloud services were, what the cloud was, etc. She still does not understand 100% of how it works, but she gets it. She shoots pictures on her iPhone, and they remain accessible Kind of forever. Also, FaceTime. Certainly it works, but how it works, like the science of how it actually works, is befuddling. Yet nobody second-guesses it.￼Or, modern day electricity, and heat and water and plumbing and sewage and sanitation. Most people have zero idea how it is made, yet we are all grateful for it. So if you have ever tried sleeping in a hot stuffy humid apartment at 120° in Southeast Asia during the summertime, you know that air conditioning might be one of the best blessings of all time to humanity. Or try to imagine walking around in Dubai in the summertime without air-conditioning in your house your car or the mall. Do you have a lot of these full saying that bitcoin is bad for the pineapple blah blah blah, but don’t you fools know that bitcoin only takes like .1% of the world’s energy, whereas air conditioning I think counts for about 33.3% of the world electricity usage? Yet nobody is trying to ban Air-conditioning! This is also another thing, I don’t really like gasoline cars, tailpipe emissions whatever, but, if suddenly overnight you band petroleum gas and the like, 95% of humidity would immediately starve or freeze to death. So I think from a basic perspective, things and economics should be optimized to think about first, the well-being of humans. Once again love these people who are too much into the environment, environmentalist, I think it is kind of a new weird cult religion; a lot of these people don’t believe in God anymore or go to church, yet have found some sort of salvation in this metaphorical mother Gaia? I get it everyone needs something to believe in, but, I think the issue here is tyrant vs choice. First, it is a free country. The land of the free. You should have the freedom to choose. This is the number one ethos of America and being American.P and this is where everyone on the political spectrum don’t understand things; if a woman wanted an abortion let her do it, if somebody wants to chop off their penis and balls and sterilize themselves, go ahead and let them do it. And maybe on the other side if somebody wants to own a gun, just let them do it. Or if they want to masturbate to an American flag let them do it. I think what then becomes the important imperative of year is once again, giving people an option and choice! And also, having the freedom and protection from idiots, on all sides of the political spectrum? For example guns, yeah yeah yeah everyone should have the right to own it, but please, don’t bring a gun to a wedding and leave it unattended in your backpack, only to have a drunk crazy lady at the wedding trying to steal everyone’s stuff in the bag coat room, finding the gun, getting surprise, and leaving it on top of your child’s car seat. (True story happened to me, I found a gun on Seneca’s car seat). I only think God that I did not accidentally pull the trigger or he did not pull the trigger or some other kid did not accidentally pull the trigger, either killing Seneca, myself Cindy or anyone else at the party. Once again, there are lots of crazy people out there and everyone is going to do crazy things to themselves, they own families whatever. But let them do all the crazy shit they want to do, just stay away from them. So similarly maybe we should have the freedom to be protected from these weirdos? So the joy and glory bitcoin is fascinating some one bitcoin hit 100 K and beyond, it was like the best party on the Internet of all time. Twitter was going absolutely insane; everyone is having a great time. I could feel the joy and enthusiasm on the Internet, all these people bursting into tears and crying, barely holding their emotions. I’m starting to get the sense of religious forever for bitcoin, which is always a good sign. Even the early days of Apple, Steve Jobs was the priest, and Apple and Apple Store was the temple. People used to camp outside the Apple Store for the new iPhone, not anymore. Apple can barely give away their products now. ￼ All the tech companies are languishing. Facebook and Meta and Instagram is getting destroyed by TikTok, the evil mainland Chinese corporation I think run by Tencent. As much bad as Google Amazon Facebook YouTube gets, no no no you fools, TikTok and China is the real enemy. And also video games, anything run by riot games or has major investment from mainland China are all bad and evil for yourself your kids or family. I would say, if I had one piece of advice to Donald Trump is that it would be just banning TikTok from America. Think about the asymmetry here; mainland China blocks all major American tech stuff in China, yet, we allow TikTok to run shores chores? I think me and them in Chinese corporations and people, especially post Malong communist upheaval, and destruction of confusion values, they no longer have any values besides more power, influence, money and capital. Just think about it, what is the apple of China’s eye? China wants to obviously become stronger and more powerful than America, yet knows that she cannot do it unless she does trade with America. If overnight we introduced 1000% tariff to all mainland Chinese things in corporations, with death and famine for mainland China. Just imagine if Donald Trump overnight declared a martial law saying that it was in fact, 100% illegal for Apple to produce any products at Foxconn in mainland China, what would that spell for me and China, and also Apple? The good news is I think we could still produce things here in America, we might not have an affordable iPhone anymore, but still… It would get done. If you had an iPhone that was 100% made only in America, it might be like 10 X the price, either that or maybe it will just be switched to some sort of expensive subscription model, but still, America would function. I don’t think China would. There is no censorship on TikTok, no content is ever flagged or taken down. Because once again, China does not care for any sort of ethics or copyright or whatever here; even during the para Olympics, and the only copyrighted videos I could watch of the Olympics were like Screen shares on TikTok? If you ever talk to any shoes liberal American, the one that is phd educated, apparently very very liberal in whatever, yet anti capitalism, just asked them, what is the origin of money, and how can they afford to pay their mortgage, or rent, or Tesla, or the gasoline for their Prius car? Or for their Whole Foods farmers markets? One might say that real money is gold, but the reason why gold is unethical is that it takes slave labor for them to produce it, ￼ and all the petroleum and gas influence created to just extract it from the Earth. And also, gold is relatively scarce but not a real scarcity ; nobody really knows how much gold lies beneath the earths crust,￼ and I could guarantee you, if suddenly overnight it is declared that gold is now $1 million an ounce, there would be a lot of capital being poured in that would mine for and discover more gold. Even at current rates, I think they extract 3% more gold every single year. So then, let us say that real wealth is not cold, then what is it? Fiat currency? Obviously not! So an observation I’ve made a few years ago is that even though I am anti-war in anti-military for the most part, unfortunately it is critical for America to have the biggest stick in order to continue the US dollar supremacy. For example, America owes what like $35 or $350 trillion of debt or some insane number, two China and Russia and whatever, what prevents America from repaying it? Our military power! And it is kind of pernicious; just go to the defense.gov website, and see how much money is being poured into Lockheed Martin, Boeing in these other defense contractors. It is really kind of bad because it is almost like a snake eating its own tail; America continues to raise her military and defense budget, and these defense contractors are getting rewarded and awarded even ever higher dollar amounts for stuff, even apparently Boeing tried to sell two jets for the president for $4.5 billion, once again taxpayer money. As a consequence, the ordinary working person in America is being squeezed; if government defense spending is that high, just imagine how much this hurts the American taxpayer who works hard and saves diligently, only to have her hard earned money being poured into some sort of stupid luxury jet and government overspending? ￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin!

Title: Pick ZS Stock Over F5?

UKRAINE - 2021/02/23: In this photo illustration, Zscaler logo of US cloud-based information ... [+] security company is seen displayed on a smartphone and pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) After a solid Q1, we think Zscaler stock (NASDAQ: ZS), a cloud-based security platform, is currently a better pick over its peer – F5 stock (NASDAQ: FFIV). ZS stock trades at 14x trailing revenues, versus 5x for FFIV stock, thanks to Zscaler’s superior revenue growth. Zscaler recently announced its Q1 fiscal 2025 results, with revenue of $628 million and adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $606 million and $0.63, respectively. The company’s outlook of $2.6 billion in sales and $2.97 (mid-point) in adjusted earnings was also slightly better than the street estimates. Still, the stock dropped 8% following the Q1 announcement. Also see Here’s Why American Eagle Outfitters’ Stock Slumped. There could be a few factors at play for this decline in ZS, including the fact that the stock had run-up 14% from $182 in early November to $208 on December 2, and investors booked some profits. Also, with the sales growth rate slowing lately, investors may not be willing to assign a higher valuation multiple for the stock. That said, the stock has seen some recovery from levels of $191 on December 2 to $206 now. Below we discuss why we think ZS is a better pick over FFIV, by comparing a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, stock returns, and valuation. FFIV stock has seen a 44% rise from levels of $175 in early January 2021 to around $255 now, while ZS stock has seen little change from $200 to $205 over the same period. This compares with an increase of about 60% for the S&P 500 over this roughly four-year period. Overall, the performance of FFIV and ZS stocks with respect to the index has been far from consistent. Returns for FFIV stock were 39% in 2021, -41% in 2022, and 25% in 2023, while ZS stock returns were 61%, -65%, and 98%, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 — indicating that both FFIV and ZS underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including, CSCO and META, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. F5’s revenue has risen at a 2.7% average annual rate from $2.6 billion in 2021 to $2.8 billion now. In comparison, Zscaler’s average revenue growth rate of 48.1% from $673 million to $2.3 billion over the same period, has been much better. F5’s revenues growth is being driven by both – services and product – amid the company’s entry into new markets. Zscaler’s revenue growth is led by an increase in customer base as well as rise in subscriptions. The company’s customer base has increased from 5,600 in 2021 to 8,650 now. The company is benefiting from increased subscription revenue toward additional users and add-on services. This trend is expected to continue in the near term. However, the company’s sales growth rate has slowed from 48% average over the last three years to 21% expected in the next few years. This still fares much better than F5, which is expected to see its top-line expand at a mid-single-digit average annual rate over the next few years. F5’s adjusted net income margin improved from 25.8% in 2021 to 28.2% in 2024, while that for Zscaler jumped from 11.2% to 23.4% over the same period. Looking at the last twelve months period, F5’s 28.2% net income margin fares better than 22.9% for Zscaler. Looking at financial risk, Zscaler seems to have an edge over F5. Both companies have low debt levels. F5’s 2% debt as a percentage of equity is slightly better than 4% for Zscaler. However, the latter’s 58% cash as a percentage of assets is much better than 19% for F5. This implies that Zscaler has more cash cushion. We see that Zscaler has seen better revenue growth and has more cash cushion. On the other hand, F5 is more profitable and has a slightly better debt position. Now, looking at prospects, we believe ZS stock will offer higher returns in the next three years. FFIV stock trades at 5x trailing revenues, aligning with the stock’s average P/S ratio over the last four years. In comparison, ZS stock trades at 14x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 30x over the last four years. Now, some decline in valuation multiple for ZS seems justified, given the fall in revenue growth rate. It may likely fall further to more reasonable levels over the coming years. However, a decline in P/S ratio will be more than offset by growth in sales, given the expected surge in revenues, and thereby resulting in higher levels for ZS stock. While ZS stock may outperform FFIV, it is helpful to see how F5’s peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SSR Mining Inc. (Nasdaq/TSX: SSRM; ASX: SSR) (SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM) or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine (CC&V) in Colorado from Newmont Corporation (Newmont) in an all-cash deal for $100 million in upfront consideration and up to $175 million in additional milestone-based payments (the Transaction (JO:TCPJ)). This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241205981031/en/ Figure 1. Overview of SSR Mining's global platform, inclusive of the Cripple Creek & Victor gold mine. 3 (Graphic: Business Wire) Strategic Rationale for the Transaction Rod Antal, Executive Chairman of SSR Mining, said, The acquisition of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine represents a rare opportunity to add a high-quality producing asset in a Tier-1 jurisdiction at an accretive valuation. CC&V is a proven operation with excellent potential for upside, and expands our U.S. based platform to an expected 300,000 “ 400,000 ounces of average annual gold production, positioning SSR Mining as the third largest gold producer in the United States. This acquisition ensures our portfolio of both producing and development assets is well balanced and provides our company with a diversified and long-lived free cash flow focused platform comprised of six key assets. The Transaction structure helps ensure our balance sheet remains a strength of our business, with CC&V expected to immediately contribute meaningful cash flow that facilitates an attractive payback. In addition to its strategic merits, CC&V employs many highly regarded mining professionals that will complement our current team, and we look forward to welcoming them all into SSR Mining. We would also like to thank Newmont for their responsible stewardship of CC&V over the last nine years. Looking ahead, we have a clear path forward, with a focus on delivering growth initiatives at each of our six key assets as we look to build our position as a leading mid-tier gold producer. Transaction Overview Consideration for the acquisition of CC&V is comprised of: Upon completion of an updated regulator-approved closure plan and in the event aggregate closure costs at CC&V exceed $500 million, SSR Mining will be responsible for funding 10% of the incremental closure costs while Newmont will be responsible for funding 90% of the incremental closure costs, either on an as-incurred basis or pursuant to a lump sum payment option. The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, upon satisfaction of preclosing conditions and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. SSR Mining expects to provide 2025 guidance for CC&V in due course following the closing of the Transaction. Overview of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine CC&V is located approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Denver, Colorado. Mining in the district dates back to the 1890's, with large-scale surface mining commencing in 1994. Currently, CC&V operations span three developed open pit areas: Globe Hill, Schist Island, and South Cresson with a total land package of more than 5,000 hectares (see Figure 2). CC&V is an epithermal gold deposit associated with alkalic intrusive rocks mined via conventional open pit mining methods. All of the current Mineral Reserves are oxides, which are stacked on valley leach facilities as either run of mine (ROM) material or after a two-stage crush. Average annual ore placement on the valley leach facilities is approximately 20 to 24 million short tons per annum, and current permitted and available leach pad capacity is more than 125 million short tons. Newmont applied for Amendment 14 to extend the mine life by adding 189 million short tons of leach pad capacity through construction of Phase 4 of the Valley Leach Facility 2 (˜VLF2') and Phase 6 of Valley Leach Facility 1 (˜VLF1'), amongst other operational considerations including pit laybacks and road adjustments. A mill facility for sulfide and transitional ore is currently on care and maintenance and does not factor into CC&V's current mine plan. Newmont has disclosed that, since acquiring the asset in 2015 for $820 million in cash, CC&V has produced over 2.5 million ounces of gold. Geology The Cripple Creek deposit occurs at the southern end of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, hosted in Oligocene age alkaline volcanic and intrusive rocks within a basement package of Proterozoic intrusives and metamorphosed sediments. The volcanic diatreme complex hosting the deposit is predominantly comprised of the Cripple Creek breccia, a heterolithic and poorly sorted unit consisting of airfall tuff, massive breccia and bedded volcaniclastics. These volcanics are crosscut by numerous intrusions, including phonolitic stocks, lamprophyres and aphanitic dykes, which corresponded in timing with, or preceded, the bulk of the gold mineralization in the epithermal Cripple Creek deposit. Mineralization occurs primarily as broad zones of low-grade, gold-pyrite, and telluride mineralization that is microfracture-controlled and disseminated, and as fracture zones containing high-grade gold-silver. Both types of mineralization are associated with potassium-feldspar + pyrite +/- carbonate alteration. Subsequent weathering and oxidation of the mineralization averaging approximately 120 meters depth, and extending deeper along major structures, is important in making the deposit amenable to heap leaching.

Information Regarding CC&V All information related to CC&V's 2024 operating guidance, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources and 2024 production and cost guidance is derived solely from Newmont press releases (Newmont Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results; Provides 2024 Outlook for Integrated Company and Newmont Announces 2023 Mineral Reserves for Integrated Company of 136 Million Gold Ounces with Robust Copper Optionality of 30 Billion Pounds) both dated February 22, 2024 (the Newmont Disclosures). You should closely review the Newmont Disclosures in their entirety to learn about the risk, considerations and qualifications to which this information is subject. We have not independently verified the information derived from the Newmont Disclosures. These historical estimates (as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101 “ Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Properties (NI 43-101)) are provided solely for information purposes and have not been independently verified by SSR Mining. These historical estimates should not be treated as SSR Mining's current estimates of Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources at CC&V. Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information are based on a gold price assumption of $1,400 per ounce for Mineral Reserves and $1,600 per ounce for Mineral Resources. Newmont has not prepared a technical report summary in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 1300 under Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a technical report in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101, and Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have not been calculated in accordance with NI 43-101. As a result, the production estimates made by SSR Mining are based on the Newmont Disclosure and have not been prepared, reviewed or verified by an independent, third-party qualified person as set forth in Subpart 1300 or NI 43-101 and SSR is not treating the historical estimate as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves for purposes of Subpart 1300 or NI 43-101. The Carlton Tunnel is a historical dewatering tunnel that was constructed from 1939 to 1941 and is one of a series of dewatering tunnels used to dewater CC&V. The tunnel is approximately 10 kilometers long and sits at an elevation of approximately 7,000 feet above sea level. The Carlton Tunnel and mine workings have not been entered or maintained since the late 1980s, when underground mining activities in the district were ceased. The outflow from the Carlton Tunnel portal runs through a series of settling ponds before it flows into Fourmile Creek.

AISC per payable ounce of gold is a non-GAAP financial measure to assist in understanding the acquisition of CC&V. Non-GAAP financial measures are referenced by the Company to assist in the measurement of operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-making, as well as to provide key performance information to senior management. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate our operating and financial performance; however, non-GAAP financial measures “ such as AISC per payable ounce of gold “ do not have any standardized meaning. These financial measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP Measure “ All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) per payable ounce of gold is a non-GAAP financial measure developed by the World Gold Council to provide transparency into the costs associated with producing gold and provide a standard for comparison across the industry. The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is cost of sales. The Company believes that AISC provides additional information regarding CC&V to better define the total costs associated with production and better understanding of the economics of CC&V's operations and performance as compared to its other mines and other producers. The Company uses cash costs per ounce of precious metals sold and AISC per ounce of precious metals to monitor its operating performance internally. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is cost of sales. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on its cost structure. The Company also believes it is a relevant metric used to understand its operating profitability. When deriving the cost of sales associated with an ounce of precious metal, the Company includes by-product credits, which allows management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold and silver production. The Company's definition and use of AISC per payable ounce of gold may not be comparable to AISC per payable ounce of gold used by Newmont, as described in the Newmont Disclosures. You are encouraged to review the discussion of AISC per payable ounce of gold included in the Newmont Disclosures, including a reconciliation to cash costs, the most comparable GAAP measure. The disclosures related to AISC per payable ounce of gold in the Newmont Disclosures provide important information, including how Newmont calculates AISC per payable ounce of gold for CC&V. Following the Acquisition, the Company may not calculate AISC per payable ounce of gold for CC&V in a manner that is consistent with the methodology described in the Newmont Disclosures. This press release also includes references to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to evaluate the ability of the Company to generate cash flow after capital investments and build the Company's cash resources. The Company calculates free cash flow by deducting cash capital spending from cash generated by operating activities. The Company does not deduct payments made for business acquisitions. Realized Cash Calculation The following table provides a calculation of realized cash for Marigold since acquisition on April 4, 2014, through September 30, 2024: (in thousands of US dollars) Marigold Revenue $3,450 Cost of Sales ($1,930) Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures ($100) Capital Expenditures ($590) $830 Taxes (i) ($110) Realized Cash After Taxes $720 (i) Represents federal and state taxes paid since acquisition View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241205981031/en/ E-Mail: invest@ssrmining.comPhone: +1 (888) 338-0046 Source: SSR Mining Inc.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 06 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 06 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR.

Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

NYSE American: UEC CASPER, Wyo., Dec. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE American: UEC) (the "Company" or "UEC") is pleased to announce the completion of the previously announced (September 23, 2024) agreement with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) America Inc. ("Rio Tinto") to acquire 100% of Rio Tinto's Wyoming assets, comprised of the wholly-owned and fully-licensed Sweetwater Plant and a portfolio of uranium mining properties, including the Red Desert Project and the Green Mountain Project, with approximately 175 million pounds of historic resources(1) (the " Transaction (JO:TCPJ)"). The purchase price paid was approximately $175.4 million in cash and was funded with UEC's available liquidity. Amir Adnani, President and CEO, stated: "The Transaction presents a rare opportunity to acquire U.S. licensed facilities and uranium mining properties from a leading global miner. These assets will significantly enhance and accelerate UEC's production capabilities in Wyoming's Great Divide Basin. The Sweetwater Plant, a 3,000-ton-per-day processing mill with a licensed capacity of 4.1 million pounds U3O8 annually, can also be adapted to recover uranium from loaded resins produced by In-Situ-Recovery ("ISR") operations, offering UEC the flexibility to support both ISR and conventional mining. With the addition of the Sweetwater Plant, UEC has the largest licensed production capacity in the U.S. The recent investments in nuclear power by Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), demonstrates unprecedented interest from several of the world's largest and most sophisticated companies in expanding America's nuclear energy baseload capacity. These companies fully realize nuclear power is a key source of highly reliable, clean and safe energy to power the increased energy demands required by AI computing. As the largest U.S.-based uranium company, UEC will play a critical role in supplying the fuel required for today and the future “ a point further underscored by Russia's recently announced uranium export restrictions." Transaction Highlights:Creates UEC's Third U.S. Hub-and-Spoke Production Platform;Acquisition of a Highly Invested Asset Base with Operating Synergies; Combined U.S. licensed production capacity of 12.1 million pounds of U3O8 per year;Drives Sizeable and Accretive Resource Growth; Unlocks Significant Scarcity Value and Production Optionality; andAdds Extensive Land Package, Geological Data and Exploration Opportunities. The Company's next steps for the acquired asset portfolio include (1) completing a SEC Regulation S-K 1300 ("S-K 1300") technical resource summary report to upgrade and confirm historic estimates, (2) building out a dedicated team to focus on advancing the Sweetwater hub-and-spoke production platform, and (3) refurbishing parts of the Sweetwater Plant and completing equipment modifications for In-Situ Recovery processing. About the Red Desert Uranium Project The Red Desert Project is a development-stage uranium project, encompassing approximately 20,005 acres of exploration and mining rights in the Great Divide Basin, including 17,750 acres of unpatented mining claims, 1,975 acres of patented lands and 1,280 acres of state uranium leases. Between three deposits, historic uranium resources are estimated at approximately 42 million pounds of U3O8 .(1) There is potential for further discoveries, particularly in the shallow mineralization adjacent to the Sweetwater Plant. The deposits are favorable for ISR mining, with uranium hosted below the water table at depths suitable for oxygen dissolution, and in fluvial sands confined by low permeability silts or clays. About the Green Mountain Uranium Project The Green Mountain Project is a development-stage uranium project located 22 miles north of the Sweetwater Plant. The project spans approximately 32,040 acres of exploration and mining rights, including 29,400 acres of unpatented mining claims, 640 acres of patented lands and 2,000 acres of state uranium leases. Between five deposits, historic uranium resources are estimated at approximately133 million pounds of U3O8 .(1) Desert View and Whiskey Peak have large areas that have been identified as having good potential for ISR mining, whereas the other deposits are considered appropriate for conventional mining. About the Sweetwater Plant The Sweetwater Plant is a 3,000 ton per day conventional processing mill with a licensed capacity of 4.1 million pounds of U3O8. It is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Rawlins and 75 miles northeast of Rock Springs, Wyoming. Access to the mill is via 30 miles of paved road from US Highway 287 to the east of the site. The fully licensed mill operated from 1981 to 1983 and has been kept under diligent care and maintenance since then. It is the only conventional processing mill in Wyoming. The plant has considerable infrastructure in place, including well-maintained buildings and equipment, a wash bay, warehouse, workshop, offices, access road and utilities. There is potential for the plant to be adapted for the recovery of uranium from loaded resins produced by ISR operations, subject to obtaining any necessary modifications to permits and licenses.Note:1.Based upon internal studies and other historic data prepared by prior owners in regards to the projects and dated between 1984 and 2019. Such estimates are being treated by the Company as historical in nature and a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources. The Company is not treating them as current resource estimates and is disclosing these historic estimates for illustrative purposes and to provide readers with relevant information regarding the projects. In addition, such estimates were not prepared under S-K 1300 standards and the results of future estimates by the Company may vary from these historic estimates.Advisors and CounselGoldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS). LLC and Rothschild & Co acted as financial advisors to UEC in connection with the Transaction. Holland & Hart LLP and McMillan LLP acted as its legal advisors. About Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE:UEC) Uranium Energy Corp is America's largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium needed to produce safe, clean, reliable nuclear energy. UEC is advancing the next generation of low-cost, environmentally friendly ISR mining uranium projects in the United States and high-grade conventional projects in Canada. The Company has two production-ready ISR hub and spoke platforms in South Texas and Wyoming. These two production platforms are anchored by fully operational Central Processing Plants ("CPPs") and served by seven U.S. ISR uranium projects with all their major permits in place. In August 2024, production began at the Christensen Ranch project in Wyoming, sending uranium loaded resin to the CPP at Irigaray (Wyoming hub). Additionally, the Company has diversified uranium holdings including: (1) one of the largest physical uranium portfolios of U.S. warehoused U3O8; (2) a major equity stake in Uranium Royalty Corp . (TSX:URC), the only royalty company in the sector; and (3) a Western Hemisphere pipeline of resource stage uranium projects. The Company's operations are managed by professionals with decades of hands-on experience in the key facets of uranium exploration, development and mining.

With the addition of the Sweetwater Plant, UEC has the largest licensed production capacity in the U.S. The recent investments in nuclear power by Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), demonstrates unprecedented interest from several of the world's largest and most sophisticated companies in expanding America's nuclear energy baseload capacity. These companies fully realize nuclear power is a key source of highly reliable, clean and safe energy to power the increased energy demands required by AI computing. As the largest U.S.-based uranium company, UEC will play a critical role in supplying the fuel required for today and the future “ a point further underscored by Russia's recently announced uranium export restrictions." Transaction Highlights:Creates UEC's Third U.S. Hub-and-Spoke Production Platform;Acquisition of a Highly Invested Asset Base with Operating Synergies; Combined U.S. licensed production capacity of 12.1 million pounds of U3O8 per year;Drives Sizeable and Accretive Resource Growth; Unlocks Significant Scarcity Value and Production Optionality; andAdds Extensive Land Package, Geological Data and Exploration Opportunities. The Company's next steps for the acquired asset portfolio include (1) completing a SEC Regulation S-K 1300 ("S-K 1300") technical resource summary report to upgrade and confirm historic estimates, (2) building out a dedicated team to focus on advancing the Sweetwater hub-and-spoke production platform, and (3) refurbishing parts of the Sweetwater Plant and completing equipment modifications for In-Situ Recovery processing. About the Red Desert Uranium Project The Red Desert Project is a development-stage uranium project, encompassing approximately 20,005 acres of exploration and mining rights in the Great Divide Basin, including 17,750 acres of unpatented mining claims, 1,975 acres of patented lands and 1,280 acres of state uranium leases. Between three deposits, historic uranium resources are estimated at approximately 42 million pounds of U3O8 .(1) There is potential for further discoveries, particularly in the shallow mineralization adjacent to the Sweetwater Plant. The deposits are favorable for ISR mining, with uranium hosted below the water table at depths suitable for oxygen dissolution, and in fluvial sands confined by low permeability silts or clays. About the Green Mountain Uranium Project The Green Mountain Project is a development-stage uranium project located 22 miles north of the Sweetwater Plant. The project spans approximately 32,040 acres of exploration and mining rights, including 29,400 acres of unpatented mining claims, 640 acres of patented lands and 2,000 acres of state uranium leases. Between five deposits, historic uranium resources are estimated at approximately133 million pounds of U3O8 .(1) Desert View and Whiskey Peak have large areas that have been identified as having good potential for ISR mining, whereas the other deposits are considered appropriate for conventional mining. About the Sweetwater Plant The Sweetwater Plant is a 3,000 ton per day conventional processing mill with a licensed capacity of 4.1 million pounds of U3O8. It is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Rawlins and 75 miles northeast of Rock Springs, Wyoming. Access to the mill is via 30 miles of paved road from US Highway 287 to the east of the site. The fully licensed mill operated from 1981 to 1983 and has been kept under diligent care and maintenance since then. It is the only conventional processing mill in Wyoming. The plant has considerable infrastructure in place, including well-maintained buildings and equipment, a wash bay, warehouse, workshop, offices, access road and utilities. There is potential for the plant to be adapted for the recovery of uranium from loaded resins produced by ISR operations, subject to obtaining any necessary modifications to permits and licenses.Note:1.Based upon internal studies and other historic data prepared by prior owners in regards to the projects and dated between 1984 and 2019.

Title: Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?

Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of Nvidia, which makes chips used to train artificial intelligence ... [+] technology, takes part in a press conference at the Government Office in Hanoi on December 5, 2024. (Photo by Nam NGUYEN / AFP) (Photo by NAM NGUYEN/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI boom, with its stock surging by over 180% this year, pushing its valuation to close to $3.4 trillion. Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this fiscal year led by surging demand for its GPUs which have become the de facto chips for AI applications. In contrast, Intel stock has had a tough year. The stock remains down by about 50% year-to-date and has a market cap of a mere $100 billion. Intel’s revenues are expected to contract this year. But here’s the twist: This might be the right time to rethink the AI bellwether. Why is that? Also see a crypto mover that is Up 300% In A Month, XRP Is Just Getting Warmed Up. The markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, they believe that demand for AI accelerators will hold up and Nvidia’s margins and growth rates will remain strong. On the other hand, Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and its foundry business struggles have made investors pessimistic about its future. However, almost everything in life is cyclical and this couldn’t be more true with the semiconductor markets. Reducing positions in Nvidia and considering Intel stock could be a wise move at this juncture. We explain below - the ‘why’. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. This is evident from Nvidia’s recent revenue growth. Sales are on track to expand from a mere $27 billion in FY’23 to almost $130 billion in FY’25. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. As models grow larger in terms of several parameters, incremental performance gains are expected to diminish. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck. With much of the Internet’s high-quality data already run through by large language models, there could be a shift from large-scale, general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized models - reducing demand for Nvidia’s high-powered GPUs. The explosive demand Nvidia has witnessed over the last few years may very well have been front-loaded, with future growth very likely slowing. Now, AI-related chip demand could shift from training to inference, which is the phase where trained models generate outputs. Inference is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors. To be sure, Nvidia will likely remain the leader by far in the inferencing space as well (it says that inferencing accounts for about 40% of its data center chip demand) but there’s certainly an opening from rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain a bit of market share. During the initial wave of generative AI, enterprises and big tech companies scrambled to invest in GPUs due to the “fear of missing out,” without worrying about costs and returns on investments. This led to a surge in pricing power for Nvidia, with its net margins coming in at over 50% in recent quarters. However, companies and their investors will eventually look for returns on their investments meaning that they could become more judicious about AI costs going forward and this is likely to hurt margins. Moreover, besides rivals such as AMD and Intel, Nvidia’s biggest customers such as Google and Amazon are doubling down on building their own AI chips. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business. While the narrative around Nvidia has been the AI boom, the pessimism around Intel has been due to its foundry business. The business has posted sizable losses ($7 billion operating loss in 2023) and has also faced a tech handicap versus industry leader TSMC. However, the division is poised for a potential comeback with its newest 18A process node. This technology, featuring RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, promises significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency. Intel has already secured contracts with major players like Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense for custom chip designs using the 18A process. Intel has achieved some key technical milestones with this process and the company expects external customers to move their first 18A designs into production in 2025. If Intel successfully executes this transition, it could shift the narrative around its foundry business. See why 2025 Could Be Intel Stock’s Comeback Year for an in depth look at how Intel stock could be re-rated higher. Moreover, with Donald Trump set to return to the White House in 2025, Intel’s extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint is also likely to emerge as a much more valuable asset. Trump’s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains could translate into favorable policies for Intel. Potential tariffs on foreign-made chips or incentives for domestic production could give Intel a competitive edge, particularly in its foundry division. Moreover, Intel’s status as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips positions it well to win more Federal government contracts. Intel stock trades at a reasonable valuation at just 23x consensus 2025 earnings. The 2025 earnings estimate is in fact depressed versus historical levels, at just about $1 per share on account of Intel’s current struggles. For perspective, Intel has reported earnings of close to $2 per share in 2022 and earnings of over $5 per share over 2021 and 2020. This means that if Intel sees earnings recover to historical levels in the coming years, the stock could similarly follow suit. The company is expected to return to revenue growth in 2024, with consensus estimates pointing to a 6% revenue increase and there are multiple tailwinds in both the chip and foundry business. Intel’s improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. Intel could also see incremental upside in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. While Nvidia has returned outsized gains, in contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia, on the other hand, trades at a lofty 48x projected FY’25 earnings. While Nvidia has seen impressive growth recently, it remains to be seen if the good times will last. And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia’s future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company’s earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that’s probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.

And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia’s future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company’s earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that’s probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.

Among them are AppLovin Corp., (APP, Financials), NVIDIA Corp., (NVDA, Financials), Constellation Energy Corp., (CEG, Financials), The Trade Desk (TTD, Financials), and Arm Holdings (ARM, Financials). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. AppLovin Corp., with a market capitalization of $100 billion and a rise from $11 to $320, has seen an incredible surge in stock price, 754.68%. Particularly in terms of user acquisition and in-game advertising revenue enhancement, the company's AI-powered platform, Axon, has proved indispensable in helping app developersespecially in the gaming sector. AppLovin's Q3 2024 numbers also amply demonstrate its financial success: adjusted EBITDA surged by 72% while income grew by 39%. This year the company is especially exceptional as it can optimize ads using artificial intelligence. NVIDIA Corp. has also exhibited rather remarkable success with its shares rising 179.95% YTD. Rising demand for the company's artificial intelligence chipsbig consumers like Elon Musk's xAI anticipating to employ up to a million NVIDIA GPUs, maybe totalizing $32 billion in expenditurehas fuelled its expansion. Alliances like Amazon's AWS, estimated to spend over $20 billion on NVIDIA chips in 2024, help to further support NVIDIA's market leadership. In June 2024, NVIDIA's market valuation topped $3 trillion, thus attesting to its dominance in the AI hardware sector and so raising investor confidence. Constellation Energy Corp. has focused on growing its portfolio of renewable energy sources by greatly funding solar and wind projects, with a YTD growth of 113.52%. These expenses have been made to meet increased demand for eco-friendly energy solutions in accordance with more broad industry trends toward sustainability. Constellation has also acquired many renewable energy businesses, therefore boosting its capacity and market share in the sector of clean energy. The Trade Desk has also been really outstanding with an 87.83% YTD increase. The company has added innovative artificial intelligence technology into its platform, therefore improving the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital advertising, which has attracted more business. Strategic partnerships with large media companies have enhanced The Trade Desk's access to premium ad inventory even further, therefore enhancing its market stance. Arm Holdings recorded an 86.76% YTD increase after its successful September 2023 IPO, therefore valuing the company at $54.5 billion and raising $4.87 billion. Arm maintains leading in the area of chip design by developing innovative semiconductor technologies, therefore preserving its competitive advantage. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: The Concord episode of Secret Level is like a message from a ghost whose unfinished business is creating a global multimedia franchise

The defunct multiplayer shooter speaks from the afterlife in Amazon's upcoming videogame-themed anthology series. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Sometime before Sony hero shooter Concord released, before it was even fully revealed to the public, the producers of Amazon TV series Secret Level—a collection of animated videogame shorts premiering on Prime Video on December 10—started working on an episode based on the game. They didn't know that the short sci-fi tale they were animating would become a message from beyond the grave. The episode, which I've seen in advance of the show's premiere, was supposed to come out in a world where Concord was, if not a Helldivers 2-level hit, a popular and well-liked game. In reality, Concord barely lasted a week. Sony quickly shut the competitive multiplayer game down due to lack of interest, and then shuttered developer Firewalk Studios, which it had acquired partway through Concord's development. I played Concord and I thought it was fun enough, and it was technically sound, but its Bungie-influenced arena shooter stylings just didn't draw a crowd, and neither did its all-in commitment to building a Guardians of the Galaxy-like sci-fi universe with weekly cutscenes. They were going to follow the exploits of a crew of Freegunners—Concord's name for its roguish space mercenaries—whose realistically-rendered faces were a little uncanny. The Secret Level episode portrays the most important moment in the history of the Freegunners, when a heroic crew of outlaws stole a map of navigation routes that allow free travel through the galaxy for enemies of The Guild, a powerful policing body. At the end of the short adventure, we jump to a space pub in the present of Concord's timeline, where the legendary story has just been retold. There, we glimpse the arm of one of Concord's mascots—Lennox, the green guy—and of course we're supposed to think, 'Hey, I know that guy!' But no one does know much about the character, outside of his creators. What we got of Concord's story from the first trailers and cutscenes tell us that he's a daredevil who really loves hot sauce, but there were supposed to have been over a dozen more in-game cinematics by now. The episode comes across like a transmission from a spirit that doesn't know it's dead yet, one that still believes everything went right for Concord and the new game studio. It's the 13th episode of the series—unlucky, eh?—and it'll drop on December 17, although I found its eerie context more notable than the short story itself. Concord is far from the only multiplayer game—or game in general—to struggle or crater this year, although it was the most dramatic impact event. We just learned that Ubisoft isn't going to keep trying to build an audience for free-to-play shooter XDefiant, and it's been an unprecedented year for studio closures and layoffs. More than 300 developers lost their jobs just this week, and thousands more jobs were cut this year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As for the rest of Secret Level, we watched and rated each episode and liked some of them, but on the whole, the animated shorts didn't charm us much. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League.

Title: Shopify Stock Is A Black Friday Beneficiary That Faces Key Test In Q4

Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce sales broke records again this year, with Adobe pointing out that US sales increased 10.2% YoY to $10.8 billion on Black Friday while Cyber Monday sales rose 7.3% YoY to ~$13.3 billion. Peak sales hit $15.8 million per minute on Monday evening. Shopify is a major beneficiary of Black Friday sales, and coming off a strong Q3, saw another record-breaking holiday. Shopify’s growth was quite strong at two times higher than overall Black Friday sales, with GMV increasing 22% YoY to a record $5 billion. For Black Friday/Cyber Monday, GMV rose 24% YoY to $11.5 billion with peak sales hitting $4.6 million per minute. POLAND - 2023/03/07: In this photo illustration a Shopify logo seen displayed on a smartphone. ... [+] (Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Q3 was strong with revenue growth accelerating to 26% YoY, operating income more than doubling YoY and FCF margin approaching 20%, the true test will be Q4. Shopify will need to prove to the Street that it can continue to re-accelerate revenue into 2025 given the strong Black Friday trends and international expansion efforts. Shopify reported a strong third quarter earlier in November, with revenue growth reaccelerating more than 500 bp sequentially. Q3 revenue increased 26.1% YoY to $2.16 billion, with growth accelerating from 20.7% in Q2. Excluding logistics (comps from Q2 23 to Q2 24), Q3 was the sixth consecutive quarter with revenue growth of >25%. For Q4, management guided revenue growth in the mid- to high-20% range, benefiting from the holiday season and building upon Q3’s growth. Given the recent data on Black Friday sales, Shopify is well on its way to deliver on this guide. Shopify's revenue growth reaccelerated in Q3 after decelerating for five consecutive quarters. Shopify pointed out three key drivers of revenue growth and strength in Q3: · Strong GMV growth · Subscription Solutions revenue growth · Increased Payments penetration I break these key points down for you below. International helped to drive the beat this quarter, with GMV “outside North America growing 33% in Q3. European GMV grew greater than 35% as our largest markets of the UK, Germany, France, and the Netherlands continue to gain traction.” Global GMV increased 24% to $69.7 billion in the third quarter, the fifth quarter in a row where growth exceeded 20%. This was driven by same-store sales growth by Shopify and Shopify Plus merchants (organic growth from existing stores), as well as that international strength. Shopify Plus is tailored to large and enterprise businesses, offering exclusive conversion and automation features and lower fees to help drive growth for those merchants. Additionally, Q3 offline GMV was up 27% YoY, and has more than doubled in just the past three years. Q3 B2B GMV grew over 145% YoY, and has now had five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth. This shows Shopify’s diversity ability to grow beyond digital stores for small-to-medium sized retail customers, which had driven the bulk of the business during the stock’s Covid surge. The expansion into Europe also shows promising signs of Shopify’s ability to scale globally in a more meaningful way. The company stated they “made enhancements to localization, shipping, and compliance, and are pairing that with intensified marketing efforts” for Europe. Black Friday was also strong and an early indicator for Q4, with Shopify recording $5 billion in GMV for the holiday, a 22% YoY increase, in-line with last year’s growth. Deutsche Bank analysts noted that this GMV puts Shopify on track to hit Q4 GMV expectations of $92.8 billion, correlating to a 23.6% YoY increase, about in line with Q3’s growth rate. To note, GMV growth of 24% lags revenue growth of 26%. This is not necessarily a negative; however, it does hint that customer spending could be slowing slightly, and a further decoupling of the two rates could suggest a revenue re-acceleration may be short-lived if this decoupling continues. Shopify’s Subscription Solutions revenue, the second stated driver of revenue growth, increased 26% YoY to $610 million, and represents 28% of revenue. Growth has decelerated from 34% YoY in Q1 and 27% YoY in Q2, but MRR trends point to growth stabilizing around 26% or reaccelerating slightly come Q4 and into 2025 with some pricing and merchant growth tailwinds. In Q3, MRR growth accelerated 3 points to 28% YoY, up from 25% in Q2, reaching $175 million. Plus contributed 31% of MRR, flat with last quarter, while Plus, Standard and Point of Sale all saw “continued growth” in Q3. In Q3, MRR growth accelerated 3 points to 28% YoY, up from 25% in Q2, reaching $175 million. Shopify Payments facilitated $43 billion in GPV in Q3, up 31% YoY, with penetration rising to 62% of GMV (compared to 58% last year). Shop Pay similarly increased 42% YoY to $17B in GMV. Management attributed the strength in payments to a few factors: strong performance of merchants utilizing Payments, more of which are Plus subscribers, higher global adoption of payments; and increasing penetration of Shop Pay. For Q4, Payments are likely to provide a headwind down the line, due to holiday season dynamics. In Q3, the lower margins on Payments came from a higher mix of Shopify Plus merchants, which are larger enterprises at a fixed rate, and due to a higher mix of credit card usage compared to debit card usage. Shopify explained that Q4 “sees a higher percentage of revenue from Payments given the high-volume holiday selling season,” and as a result, management expects “higher dollar losses on Payments” due to that volume growth. Analysts are forecasting that Shopify regresses back towards revenue growth in the 20% range by FY25. Currently, Shopify is estimated to report 27.2% YoY growth in Q4, supported in part by 24% YoY growth in Cyber Week GMV. This would mark a sequential acceleration of 110 bp, and 360 bp faster growth than the 23.6% recorded last Q4. Analysts are forecasting that Shopify regresses back towards revenue growth in the 20% range by ... [+] FY25. Shopify’s revenue growth is more correlated to GMV growth now as opposed to 2022 and early 2023. For example, Shopify was reporting revenue growth rates >10 percentage points higher than GMV growth due to GPV growth, pricing and merchant revenue growth. By Q4 2023, revenue growth became much more closely tied to GMV – Shopify reported 23.2% GMV growth in that quarter and 23.6% revenue growth, and in Q1 2024, GMV growth was 22.8% versus revenue growth of 23.4%. However, Q3 showed a larger decoupling of the two, with GMV growth of 24.0% lagging revenue growth by more than 2 percentage points. Q3 showed a larger decoupling of GMV and revenue growth, with GMV growth of 24.0% lagging revenue ... [+] growth by more than 2 percentage points. This suggests that if GMV growth begins to peak in Q4 and decelerate, revenue growth may soon follow if Shopify cannot push GPV growth to >30% or pull additional levers such as pricing to maintain a high-20% revenue growth rate. To point out, analysts currently expect GMV growth of ~23.6% in Q4, again much slower than the 27.2% estimated revenue growth rate, though increased Payments volume will play a role in that. Moving into 2025, if GMV trends towards 20%, there’s risk that revenue growth will follow. These are a few things that I’m watching for as I continue to evaluate Shopify. I provide weekly deep dives, real-time trade alerts and weekly webinars to evaluate positions and discuss potential entries and exits. Learn more here. Shopify is executing very well despite margin headwinds, driving operating income growth well in the triple digits despite contracting gross margins in Q3. Corporate gross margin contracted 90 bp, dropping from 52.6% last year to 51.7%, weighed down by Merchant Solutions (accounting for 55% of gross profit dollars), where gross margin contracted 130 bp to 39.7%. Management added that Payments had an adverse impact to Merchant Solutions’ gross margin for two reasons: it accounted for a larger portion of revenue, while it also had lower margins due to higher Plus merchant mix on a fixed rate and a higher credit card mix compared to debit cards. Despite the headwinds to gross margin, Shopify’s cost optimization efforts are bearing fruit. Gross profit increased 24% YoY, or $217 million in dollar terms, while operating expenses increased just 7% YoY, or $56 million in dollar terms. This drove a 132% YoY increase in adjusted operating income from $122 million in $283 million, or 13.1% of revenue. This led to a 99% increase in adjusted net income, excluding equity investment impacts. Q4 is expected to see this dynamic continue, despite more margin headwinds. Based on management’s guidance, gross margin is expected to contract 3.2% QoQ and 1.1% YoY while operating income is projected to increase 2.8% QoQ and increase 2.5% YoY. Shopify has a couple catalysts ahead, one in moving upstream to capturing more enterprises on the platform, and the other within AI and automation features facilitating daily workflows for merchants. In Q3, management highlighted that the quarter was “an exceptional quarter in terms of new enterprise-level brands” from all verticals coming to Shopify. Management said that enterprise “is a massive opportunity to build for the long term,” with the opportunity only beginning to bud, with just 16 enterprise launches in Q3. Shopify believes it offers a value proposition for enterprises to switch to its platform due to flexibility and speed. To demonstrate this, management explained that “one merchant recently brought over 44,000 SKUs to Shopify in less than three minutes, a task that used to take hours if not days. This significant reduction in data migration hassle is a big deal as it removes major friction point for merchants looking to move to Shopify.” Migrating over more enterprise brands in the coming quarters can provide tailwinds to both GMV and GPV, bringing more sales and more payment transactions to the platform. The data migration point ties hand in hand with another catalyst for Shopify, arising from AI and automation features. Shopify is working on improving merchant automation, from data migration to inventory management and more. Shopify Flow, which is Shopify’s low-code workflow automation app that empowers merchants to build custom automations has been improved with 304 new actions in the API. Shopify Inbox is now utilizing AI to assist merchants in quickly responding to customer inquiries, while new automations for tax filings and VAT were added to Shopify Tax. Shopify is also implementing artificial intelligence to drive higher levels of personalization for customers, and in turn, drive higher value for merchants. President Harley Finkelstein explained Shopify thinks “search and AI together makes the Shop search way more relevant, way more personalized,” and that “the change that we've made, in some cases, have led to an 18% increase in sessions where a buyer engages in a recommendation with our new home feed.” To that extent, Shopify announced that Mikhail Parakhin recently joined as CTO, after spending more than a decade at Microsoft helping to launch Copilot and spearheading search and AI innovations at Yandex. Shopify said that Parakhin “brings a wealth of experience in AI and search technologies” and “in just over two months since he joined us, he has already made a significant impact enhancing our products.” As long as any weakness can hold $89.95, I expect the uptrend to push into the $132 region and then the $150 - $190 region. If any further weakness cannot hold $89.95, then the odds SHOP will push higher go down significantly. It is well above this level, so we should continue to look higher. As long as any weakness can hold $89.95, I expect the uptrend to push into the$132 region and then ... [+] the $150 - $190 region Once it gets to the $132 - $190 region, what next? This is where SHOP gets a little tricky. The larger uptrend off the 2022 low has unfortunately been quite messy. This opens the door to several potential larger patterns in play. What my firm can say with a higher degree of confidence is that if SHOP can break above the $190 region and do so on elevated volume and in a direct manner, it will favor the more bullish interpretation of what is potentially playing out. However, if it fails to breakout over the $190 region, and instead see a larger pullback from the $150 - $190 region, then we will likely see a notable correction before pushing higher. We really will not know what is in play from a technical analysis perspective until we get into the above target range and see what SHOP’s price does next. Shopify has performed well despite gross margin headwinds, as prudent cost optimization efforts are leading to significant operating leverage. Q3 demonstrated this with triple digit operating income growth despite gross margin contracting nearly 1 percentage point. Although this dynamic along with strong growth is expected to continue into next quarter, ideally I’d want to see GMV keep pace with revenue growth into 2025. Analysts seem to agree with next year consensus showing growth exiting next year at 21.2%. Although the near-term catalyst is strong Black Friday performance, likely leading to strong holiday performance (we will see), the medium-term catalysts are found in global expansion, increased enterprise mix, and placing more focus on AI and automation features to help merchants increase productivity and drive more sales.

Title: UnitedHealthcare CEO: Brian Thompson’s death showed something grim about America
URL: https://slate.com/technology/2024/12/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-shooting-stock-market-economy.html
Time Published: 2024-12-05T22:43:40Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday morning, a still-unknown assailant shot and killed the CEO of controversial health insurance company UnitedHealthcare outside the New York Hilton Midtown, where parent company UnitedHealth Group was about to hold an investor meeting. Even though that meeting was naturally canceled, UnitedHealth’s investors didn’t seem too perturbed. In fact, outside of a brief dip in the immediate aftermath of the murder, UnitedHealth’s share value made a hefty rebound and closed Wednesday evening at $610.79—its highest level in a month, and not too far below the year-to-date peak UNH saw just after the election ($625.25). Does that make any sense? Sure, yes, there was a healthy financial outlook projected for the company in 2025. And the stock did begin to correct a little on Thursday, sinking below the $600 threshold, but getting nowhere near the year-to-date nadir the stock reached in April ($439.20). Keep in mind, this was a year when UnitedHealth traders kept selling off their shares, the company was sued by the federal government to block a planned acquisition, the personal information of nearly 100 million customers was stolen in a Russian cyberattack, and UnitedHealth was found to have both exploited veterans and deployed an algorithm to deny millions of Americans coverage for mental health treatment. Yet the CEO’s assassination, a shocking event to cap off an ignominious year, took an immediate back seat to internal buzz of promising financial tidings. Put it this way: Do you think shareholders for one of the 10 largest companies in the world were looking to the reactions across social media—which were overwhelmingly poking fun at the deceased and reminding readers that UnitedHealth has generated its revenue largely through deceptive means, to the point that the American Economic Liberties Project once published a “UnitedHealth Group Abuse Tracker”—and concluding that the sentiment will have no severe impact on their bottom line, and the firm’s? Perhaps that’s a naïve question, considering that over the past few years, Americans experienced an ever-widening divergence between how the stock market is doing and how they’re doing individually. No, the stock market alone is not The Economy, but it continues to be cited as a “traditional indicator” of economic well-being that is supposed to be registered thus by the public. As the Brookings Institution explained in an October report, stock market performance was generally considered one of four main metrics that, before the pandemic, served as a reliable predictor of Americans’ economic satisfaction. The other three metrics: unemployment, inflation, and consumption habits. Obviously, this formula got skewed in post-pandemic economic recovery, with prices burning in voters’ minds more deeply than anything else. As my colleague Shirin Ali and I have noted, there are myriad pain points for Americans not at all covered by these variables: Modern inflation gauges don’t incorporate swelling costs of mortgages, debt, and insurance; the high “aggregate consumption” of the 2020s is mostly made up of consumers spending on those very necessities; low unemployment and a strong job market covered for the fact that college graduates often faced high rates of underemployment; and stock market performance writ large operated at heights far away from harsher realities on the ground. UnitedHealth may have been a “good” stock this year, but the number of Americans without health insurance grew this year. That’s not a coincidence. The CEO of the American Hospital Association pointed out in a July 2021 article that UnitedHealth Group earned $9.2 billion in a single quarter in 2020 due to “broad-based deferral of care.” That means they profited off “missed childhood vaccinations, reduced access to opioid misuse treatment and avoided emergency care for cardiac arrest.” “But even this isn’t the full story,” he added. “Throughout the course of the pandemic, United pursued a number of changes to its policies to further restrict patients’ coverage. United didn’t just profit from avoided care, it actively sought to scale back what care it would pay for at the same time.” In other words: The health of UnitedHealth’s stock price clearly does not correlate with Americans’ financial (or physical) health. If anything, one of the most valuable companies in the world, and one of the biggest stock market players on the charts, benefits from an upswing in American precarity. For experienced analysts, this disparity may seem obvious. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic depression, plenty of observers noted how jarring it was to see the stock market continue to roar above it all. “The stock market is not the economy” would thus become a favored phrase among the commentariat, with esteemed writers like Paul Krugman stressing how the ticker charts mainly reflect corporate profits and long-term projections over anything else. Far more twisted, however, is the fact that the COVID markets boom actually did make a perverse sense for a few telling reasons: The federal government acted quickly to pour money into the pocketbooks of unemployed Americans, small businesses, and (yes) giant corporations, via flawed but effective programs; the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for the sake of investment rejuvenation; the sectors that were hardest hit by the pandemic tended to revolve around smaller brick-and-mortar establishments, while tech-based sectors that could adapt easier to virtual and remote work did just fine—and acted as far bigger drivers of overall stock market performance. The pandemic was one thing, but what happened after its peak was much weirder and less discussed when it came to the “stock market = economy?” discourse. (One exception: some renewed chatter when stocks soared, again, in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection.) After all, Wall Street has very recently failed another historical predictor. Per a preelection CNN Business analysis: “In all but two elections since 1944, the incumbent party has won the race for the White House when the S&P 500 advanced between the end of July and Halloween.” As we all know, Democrats did not win, despite the S&P’s rigorous health this fall. To understand why Americans weren’t in tune with the S&P, you can just look back at their investment habits throughout the Biden years. There was the meme-stock craze of early 2021, which spurred some premature adulation of a group of Reddit-addled proles taking back the financial system for their own—even though their potency did not last long at all. There was the crypto mania that exploded that year, only to come crashing down hard in 2022 when interest rates went up and fraudsters like Sam Bankman-Fried were exposed. There was the surge in legalized sports betting, whose addictive nature has fueled a devastating financial crush among willing gamblers. There were the people who began buying actual gold bricks again, in turn ditching market-oriented investment instruments like exchange-traded funds. Those are the places where most retail traders turned during a decade that saw their pockets fattened thanks to government stimulus and, frankly, virtual scams abetted by the increased digitization of money and by A.I. advances. That’s where we turn to another weird market development: what artificial intelligence hype hath wrought. In the two years since ChatGPT’s debut, there’s been one truly consistent market story: already highly capitalized Big Tech firms retaining their investors’ bullishness (and driving stock market performance as a whole) simply through promises of A.I. wonders to come. The chipmaker Nvidia, never the most valuable stock, has surged greatly upon the broader realization that its tech will be useful for powering A.I. training. Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have far outperformed other companies on the S&P and Nasdaq indices almost solely off repeated promises for new A.I. goodies—no matter how expensive, resource-intensive, unprofitable, deceptive, buggy, and straight-up undeliverable these pledges really are. But ordinary Americans are not stowing their cash here; the most moneyed oligarchs are doing so. (In fact, many Americans are pushing back against the buildout of A.I. data centers in their neighborhoods, a bit of infrastructure that Big Tech considers essential for its valuations.) About 62 percent of the country’s population participates in the stock market at some level, but that number is not as impressive as it may seem: In 2023, per the Federal Reserve, the richest 10 percent owned 93 percent of available equities on the market, while the bottom 50 percent owned just 1 percent—a record in the charted gap between the richest and poorest investors. Even then, the Federal Reserve has found that just 21 percent of American households directly own specific shares; most have investments “exposed” to the market through retirement portfolios, and few people actually make use of instruments like mutual funds. The stock market has always been a rich person’s game, but it’s never been clearer than now. Americans are saddled with a lot of debt, and willing to look for get-rich-quick schemes that operate outside of Wall Street—especially as fewer new companies go public these days, thanks to swollen interest rates, and as private equity takes more assets off the wider market. Thus, a memecoin launched by Haliey “Hawk Tuah” Welch can earn greater immediate traction than an excitable IPO. Legal gambling on elections and sports can command billions of dollars in volume. Holding on to real gold can seem a lot more stable than zigzagging lines on a chart. The broader American indifference toward stocks isn’t likely to resolve anytime soon. As Bloomberg pointed out back in June, tech stocks’ record goodwill has sat in stark contrast with a different sector that normally helps to prop up the financial markets: consumer discretionary goods, aka the unneeded products that Americans buy when they have some disposable income. That sector was the second-worst performer in the S&P 500, even though it usually is strong enough to guide the direction of the index. That seems a much more reliable indicator of how Americans are feeling, overshadowed though it may be by tech hype. But the A.I. hype can’t last forever without delivering some real profit and returns. And when that sector drops and drags Wall Street down with it, Americans invested elsewhere will probably perceive the plunge as old news. Thanks for signing up!

Title: Costco (COST) Pre-Earnings: Why This Retail Giant Is Poised to Keep Climbing
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-cost-pre-earnings-why-224251830.html
Time Published: 2024-12-05T22:42:51Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its Fiscal Q1 results on December 12th, after the closing bell. The wholesale giant has been one of the most successful retail stocks of 2024 and has maintained strong performance for several years. As earnings day approaches, I see no reason for this trend to be interrupted. To be clear, my bullish outlook on COST is rooted in fundamental factors such as its steady, profitable membership-based model—a rare advantage for a non-tech company—and its ability to weather periods of economic softness better than most retailers. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter In this article, I’ll provide a recap of Costco’s recent performance, highlight what might stand out in Fiscal Q1, and explain why, despite its relatively high valuation, I believe Costco is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. In early September, Costco released its Fiscal Q4 results. While the company’s top-line performance fell short of market expectations, its strong profitability results helped justify the bullish outlook. Costco’s net sales for the quarter totaled $78.2 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year, but came in below the $79.91 billion expected by analysts. This miss was primarily due to membership fees, which reached $1.51 billion, reflecting a 6.5% year-over-year increase. Although there was a slight decline in renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada—falling to 92.5% from 93% in Q4—this was attributed to an online promotion that brought in about 2,000 new users, leading to the small drop in membership renewals. Despite this, Costco’s bullish momentum remained intact. While the top line missed expectations, the bottom line exceeded them significantly. Costco reported non-GAAP EPS of $5.29 per share, outperforming analyst estimates of $5.07, marking an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Given that Costco has managed to grow its bottom line faster than its revenue and has increased membership fees for the first time since 2017, this should contribute to higher profitability in Q1. As a result, the positive trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters. Looking ahead to Costco’s upcoming Fiscal Q1 results, I believe that the favorable outlook should hold if the company continues to report membership increases, which is arguably the main driving force behind the company’s investment thesis. To begin with, Costco registered 76.2 million paid memberships in Fiscal Q4, growing at 7.3% year-over-year. This was a very similar growth rate to Q3 when it registered an increase of 7.8%. It is worth noting that over half of Costco’s profitability depends on membership fees. Indeed, the firm generated $4.82 billion in memberships that were essentially pure profit. Given that Costco’s total operating income is $9.29 billion, I believe that profitability will continue to rise if memberships keep growing. And speaking of profitability, the numbers that Costco has to beat in Q1 are earnings of $3.78 per share on revenue of $62.38 billion, which equate to year-over-year growth rates of 5.6% and 7.83%, respectively. Interestingly, Costco reported a 6.9% growth in adjusted comparable sales during the last quarter, which was probably the best market share gain in the consumer staples industry. I believe this proves that Costco’s value offering does very well in all environments where value-seeking increases. And I see no reason not to believe that the trend of strong sales comps shouldn’t also prove strong in Fiscal Q1, thus sustaining organic growth and maintaining operational efficiency. As is often the case, the primary risk to Costco’s bullish thesis remains well-known to investors: the stock tends to trade at a significant premium compared to most of its peers. Currently, Costco trades at a 54.6x forward P/E ratio, a valuation that can largely be attributed to qualitative factors such as strong management, high customer loyalty, and the company’s business model. Given that much of Costco’s profitability stems from a hyper-loyal network of members who pay a fee, there is a general consensus that the company’s financial performance will remain robust regardless of the consumer environment, which reduces the perceived risk for investors. However, the high valuation raises concerns for many investors. Paying 54 times earnings for a company may seem excessive, even if Costco can manage to grow its earnings by 10% annually. At that growth rate, it would still take roughly 20 years to recoup the investment at this valuation—a lengthy period for a consumer staples and discretionary business. As Costco heads into Fiscal Q1, this is clearly not an opportunity to capitalize on any weakness, given that the stock is trading at all-time highs. This, understandably, raises concerns for investors about whether they’re overpaying for the stock. While COST may be vulnerable to short-term pressure if minor setbacks occur, such as a dip in membership growth or slower sales, any corrections would likely be a response to stretched valuations. That said, in the long-term, as long as Costco maintains its current business model—particularly with membership fees contributing more than half of its profits and with renewal rates consistently above 90%—I believe that the stock will continue to trend upward. At TipRanks, the consensus among Wall Street analysts for COST is a Moderate Buy, with 18 out of 26 analysts being bullish on the stock, while eight remain neutral. The average price target is $957, which implies a downside risk of -3.42% based on the latest share price. See more COST analyst ratings I rate Costco stock as a Buy heading into its Fiscal Q1 earnings, although I acknowledge that any potential hiccups in comparable sales, revenue growth, or membership renewal rates could put pressure on the stock, given its stretched valuation. However, I don’t believe such pressure would have a lasting effect beyond the short term. While Costco’s stock may appear to have limited upside at its current valuation, even with favorable results, it remains a solid defensive pick for long-term investors. The company’s business model—built on high volume, low margins, and strong membership retention—drives steady profit growth across various consumer environments. This should support the stock’s upward trajectory and push it to new highs over time. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.—Julie A. Cullivan, a director at Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON), recently sold 1,261 shares of the company's common stock. The sale comes as Axon, now valued at over $52 billion, trades near its 52-week high with a remarkable 196% return over the past year. According to InvestingPro analysis, the company maintains a "GREAT" financial health score of 3.12 out of 5. The transaction, which took place on December 4, 2024, was executed at a weighted average price of $682.06 per share, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $860,077. Following this sale, Cullivan retains ownership of 2,392 shares in the company. The transaction was carried out in multiple trades at prices ranging from $681.88 to $682.54, according to the filing. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise has been making headlines due to its impressive financial performance and favorable analyst outlook. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently upgraded Axon from Equalweight to Overweight, indicating a growing confidence in the company's growth rate, which has been reported between 25-30%. This upgrade follows Axon's robust third-quarter performance, with record bookings and a 32% year-over-year growth in revenue. The company's focus on artificial intelligence and TASER products has played a significant role in this success. Axon also raised its Q4 revenue guidance to between $560-570 million and expects full-year revenue to exceed $2.07 billion. Furthermore, Axon's financial health is underpinned by its strong gross profit margins of 59.75% and more cash than debt on its balance sheet. However, shares of Axon and other defense sector companies, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), experienced a decline in response to potential ceasefire reports between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah. These are recent developments and reflect the dynamic nature of the market. As always, investors are advised to conduct their own research and consult with a financial advisor.

Title: HBO’s Casey Bloys Talks Competition From Netflix, International “Reset” & Sky Lawsuit As Audience Given ‘The White Lotus’ & ‘The Last Of Us’ Sneak Peeks At Max Showcase

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Casey Bloys was questioned by press this evening at a rare Max showcase in London as a small number of attendees were treated to sneak peeks of The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Game of Thrones prequel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. A trio of the streamer’s most anticipated shows were unveiled by the senior U.S. exec including the third season of The White Lotus, which moves to Thailand. The Last of Us video-game adaptation was one of its biggest shows last year and has amassed huge viewing in the UK via Sky. That second series was shown to attendees. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, meanwhile, was displayed in all its humor and irreverence. The prequel takes a somewhat different tone to House of the Dragon and the original Game of Thrones. Also on show were Mark Ruffalo-starring crime drama Task and Stephen King adaptation IT: Welcome to Derry.

Rowling Says & More Bloys was also in London touting Max’s local programing, as the U.S. streamer attempts to shift the narrative on local originals. Local original commissioning was halted in a number of European territories two years ago and layoffs followed, but Bloys, who spoke alongside Salma Hayek Pinault, Diane Kruger and Harry Potter showrunner Francesca Gardiner, said the streamer is in a different place. Watch on Deadline “This is an answer to the reset from a couple of years ago,” he said. “The great Netflix correction was happening [back then] and we were reassessing spending and profitability. We were not alone in that but part of the reason for doing this today was so you could see [local originals are] very much a part of what we are doing going forwards in many territories.” On competition from Netflix, he said Max will remain in its lane rather than taking on the streamer across all genres. “We are knowing that the people who will use Max will probably have both Netflix and Amazon,” he said. “Netflix is big and established and is doing everything. We are leaning into what we do well as a company.” Bloys was also placed under pressure over the lawsuit filed three months ago from long-running partner Sky that is alleging several breaches of a multi-year agreement between the two companies that was signed in 2019 relating to the upcoming Harry Potter series. Sky has long carried HBO content and the pair’s well-known output deal expires soon, with many possibilities for what happens next to Sky content in the UK, Germany and Italy. Bloys said he couldn’t comment on the Sky lawsuit but noted that the pair “have a lot of history and hopefully it gets resolved.” “We have said Max will launch in the UK in 2026,” he added of the relationship with Sky. “What that looks like is ongoing.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: Costco's Combo Of Strong Loyalty, Unmatched Value Is Rare In Retail: Analyst

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Thursday, JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $1,090 (from $945 prior) while maintaining an Overweight rating following November sales results. The company reported net sales of $21.87 billion for the retail month of November (four weeks ending December 1, 2024), reflecting a 5.6% increase from $20.71 billion last year. For the twelve-week first quarter ending November 24, 2024, net sales reached $60.99 billion, up 7.5% from $56.72 billion last year. Net sales for the first thirteen weeks totaled $66.52 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $62.04 billion in the prior year. E-commerce sales in November were down by an estimated 15 percentage points due to the later timing of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday this year compared to last year. This shift resulted in a roughly 1.5% decrease in total and comparable sales. The analyst writes that they continue to believe that COST remains a core holding due to its unmatched value proposition, characterized by 11% gross margins, a loyal customer base with a ~90% renewal rate, and a global growth opportunity of 2%-3% annually. The analyst adds that this combination is rare in retail and consumer staples, with the potential to double its current store base. The latter is its GICS classification. The analyst adds that Costco continues to outperform most of retail in terms of share gains and traffic trends, particularly due to its 70% consumable assortment. For December, the analyst expects core U.S. comps to be +6.7%, Canada to +8.2%, and Other International to +9.0%, resulting in a total company core comp of +7.2%. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:VDC) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA). Price Action: COST shares are down 0.49% at $986.06 at the last check Thursday.

Title: 2:00PM Water Cooler 12/5/2024

Full Content:
By Lambert Strether of Corrente. Bird Song of the Day Northern Mockingbird, Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary, Westchester, New York, United States. “Amazing repertoire of other species’ songs woven into this song. This mockingbird was imitating several species including cardinal, robin, killdeer, Carolina Wren, and Tufted Titmouse. It is unclear whether it was also imitating a Song Sparrow, because one was very nearby and its voice can also be heard on the audio.” * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Assassination Attempts (Plural) “Secret Service director vows reorganization as members of Congress press him over major lapses” [Associated Press]. “During the hearing, Rowe was repeatedly asked by flabbergasted lawmakers how problems so obvious in hindsight were allowed to happen, including communications difficulties between the Secret Service and local law enforcement that help secure events [in Butler, PA] and the building overlooking the rally being left unprotected.” And: “Trump has not yet named his pick to lead the agency.” Democrats en déshabillé “Jeffries stays out of the way as Dems mutiny against senior panel leaders” [Politico]. The deck: “Democrats are increasingly anxious about the incoming Trump administration and are no longer bowing to seniority rules to pick their committee leaders.” About time. More: “Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, 76, announced this week that he would step down from the top Democratic spot on the Natural Resources Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, 77, dropped his bid to continue leading Democrats on Judiciary in the face of a tough challenge from 61-year-old Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland. And Rep. David Scott of Georgia, 79, is facing multiple challenges for the top Democratic spot on the Agriculture Committee. It’s akin to a mutiny, especially given Democrats’ typical deference to seniority in who leads panels. But party lawmakers are increasingly anxious about the incoming Trump administration and full GOP control of Congress. Many feel it’s crucial to have leaders who are proven fighters and can effectively push back on Republican priorities like harsh limits on legal immigration. It echoes the argument many used when they called on President Joe Biden to step off the ticket over the summer. At the center of it all is Jeffries, the minority leader, and his leadership team, who also skipped the seniority line in many ways when they rose to the top ranks two years ago. They have publicly stayed out of it, loath to stand in the way of lawmakers who, like them, chafed at the party’s strict adherence to seniority.” And: “”The caucus will guide these kinds of discussions,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the No. 3 House Democrat. “We’re confident that at this time it’s going to take a Democratic Caucus that’s firing on all cylinders to push back against extremism and to make sure we can carry forward the bipartisan principles that we’ve talked about.'” • Ick. Mush. “Scoop: Pelosi backing “some” House Dem committee ousters” [Axios]. • Maybe, for example– “Scoop: AOC expected to run for top Oversight Committee role” [Axios]. “Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday she is ‘interested’ in the role and has had ‘a lot of outreach from colleagues’ about a run. She told reporters on Wednesday morning that she has ‘spoken with many members of our caucus, including several members of leadership’ about the race. Ocasio-Cortez also laid out her vision for the panel, saying she wants to use it as a ‘communicative platform for public education’ and a vehicle for ‘real legislative work and investigatory work.'” • And speaking of AOC: With Governor Delgado having finally enacted the special master's court-ordered redrawn map, we can now map the 2028 Presidential election by New York's new districts Districts eliminated:NY-10 (Hoylman)NY-14 (Ocasio-Cortez)NY-22 (Tenney) Posting info on key races below pic.twitter.com/fm30EOypjF — Lily in the City (@LilyArtemisTO) December 5, 2024 * * * “Democrats are checked out after their drubbing — here’s how they can reengage” [The Hill]. “Democrats are tuning away from news networks and social media platforms in numbers that are impossible to ignore. MSNBC and CNN saw their ratings slashed in half as exhausted Democrats tuned out post-election. On Twitter (now X, after its acquisition by Elon Musk), lefty users have deserted the platform in droves in favor of competitor Bluesky.” At some point, the exodus of “lefty [sic] users” from X (611 million users) to Bluesky (20 million) will stop. When it does, we’ll have a good reading on how many Blue MAGA there really are. More: “Print outlets are faring even worse, with furious Democrats still canceling their Washington Post subscriptions nearly a month after owner Jeff Bezos spiked the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. One in 10 Washington Post subscribers have quit the paper since October, blowing a sizable hole in the paper’s already threadbare earnings. That raises an existential question for media outlets and for Democrats: Where will all those disillusioned eyes go?” And: “Democrats were once masters of the populist message. If they want to rebuild after last month’s electoral disaster, they’ll need to reconnect with that part of their political psyche — fast. ” • They can’t and won’t. As Thomas Frank shows in Listen, Liberal!, liberal Democrats hate the working class. Since improved messaging, if it is to last, implies actually delivering on policy, they’ll fight improved messaging tooth and nail (as will their wealthy donors, as we saw in the Kamala campaign’s refusal to campaign on Lina Khan). Alternatively, of course, the Democrat leadership could believe there’s no problem at all; a few thousand votes here and there and 2028 is practically in the bag. And of course, the Democrat leadership has gradually eviscerated the primary process, so all the leadership will really need to do is go into a smoke-filled room, pick a slightly better candidate than Kamala, and give them more runway than a hundred days. How hard could that be? “Democrats need to take the working class seriously and literally” [Salon]. “And then there was the following phrase (or some version of it) that I heard many times on the bus, the train and in my conversations with Uber and Lyft drivers. “Donald Trump may act crazy or be a jerk, but he is right about that!….” Donald Trump’s raw honesty and lack of a filter or self-censoring are central to his appeal. Many Americans may disagree with the specifics of what Donald Trump says about immigration, women, racial and ethnic minorities, or how he will rule when he is back in power. But as shown by polls and focus groups, many of them do like the fact that Trump, unlike Kamala Harris and the mainstream news media and other elites, is at least talking in a clear and direct way about the things that are causing them anxiety and upset in their daily lives….. To win back their own base voters — and more importantly to expand their support among independents, undecided voters and those who have dropped out of politics and the country’s civic life — Democrats need to do a much better job of listening to everyday people, meeting them where they are and taking their concerns and agency seriously. Whatever one may think about Donald Trump, his propagandists and other agents, at this moment, they and the MAGAverse are doing a much better job of listening to and shaping public opinion and the national narrative and mood than are the Democrats and the legacy news media.” • At first reading, this is another messaging take. But the listening part is not (and I don’t mean a “listening tour.” If there were such a thing as a 21st century precinct captain — online? — they should be doing the listening). “I Watched the Democratic Collapse in Florida. I Fear It’s Happening Nationally” [The Bulwark]. “The truth is we got here because our brand sucks. We tend to put voters in different buckets—black, Hispanic, young, gay, etc.—and treat these groups like they are more progressive than they really are, and somehow unique from each other. At the same time, we’ve made decisions to stop talking to large chunks of the electorate. Some of these decisions can’t be fixed. For example, I wish we would have been more intentional about molding the Obama operation into something more permanent for the party to utilize. Coming out of 2008, rather than investing in partisan infrastructure, many in my party—in some cases led by the Obama White House—encouraged the development of “long-term progressive infrastructure,” with the idea that not-for-profit organizations could better address political needs, instead of state parties. Not only has this experiment failed at the core organizing level in states like Florida, but it has encouraged the idea that Democrats are beholden to progressive groups and values. We should have continued something akin to the old Howard Dean plan to invest in all fifty states.” Thanks, Obama! And the conclusion: “[B]asically, we must get back to listening to the median voter.” Listening, but also leading. The author has this good metaphor: “Has anyone had to buy refrigerator recently? After having previous had one for twelve years, I’m now on my third in seven—not because the actual refrigerator is breaking but because all the ‘smart’ technology on my fridge is. Last time I went in, I said, I just want a dumb fridge that works. Just the basics—works for appliances and for elections.” • Universal concrete material benefitsMR SUBLIMINAL Socialism is that “dumb fridge that works” (see FDR. And the CARES Act). Lead the voters there. Don’t commission another boatload of polling in quest of the mythical “median voter,” recognizable only in retropect by campaign professionals who, if you were sharing a post-prandial libation, would be the first to admit that nobody knows anything. “Will Democrats “Get in Touch” with Working-Class America?” [John Halpin, The Liberal Patriot]. By Betteridge’s Law… “[I]n a comprehensive post-election survey of 4800 working-class voters conducted by PPI and YouGov (including oversamples in the battleground states of AZ, GA, MI, WI, and PA), Republicans outperformed Democrats across every indicator of party leadership and values.” Handy chart: Wowsers. “The Left-Flank Albatross” [Michael Baharaeen, The Liberal Patriot]. “Of course, liberals deserve representation too, and it’s completely fair to be concerned about issues like abortion, climate change, and minority rights. But winning in politics requires meeting voters where they are and catering to the issues they care most about. Harris and her team may protest that they tried to make the economy a central focus of her campaign, downplay hot-button topics, and employ tough rhetoric about the southern border, but none of it resonated with the voters they needed most. As the party moves forward, it must grapple with this reality and learn from it if they are to repair their image and chart a new path.” • It’s weird for an organization that calls itself “Third Way” (cited approvingly in the piece) to keep pushing a binary (left-right) paradigm (as opposed to, say, right-liberal-left tripolar model). I suppose, for them, the “third way” is rightwards (they would say they’re chasing the median voter, but it’s the chasing, and not leading, that’s the problem). Realignment and Legitimacy “The Fight Has Only Just Begun” [The Progressive]. “Once upon a time, a majority of U.S. voters rejected a capable, competent, and intelligent daughter of Black and Indian immigrants in favor of a diminished, ignorant, racist son of a multimillionaire, proving that the United States remained a great country for old, white men.” • This is what passes for “left” analysis at The Progressive. Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

Stay safe out there! Transmission: Covid “Are flu and COVID high now? Here’s how the season has started” [Alexander Tin, CBS]. Tin is a good guy, but Covid is not seasonal. That said: “COVID-19 emergency room visits are ‘low’ or ‘minimal’ in nearly all states, after this year’s late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are “minimal” in all regions, compared to “high” levels around this time last year. ‘Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we’re going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,’ said [University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler]. Both [Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University’s public health school] and Lessler said one major ‘data gap’ making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge. A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections. Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1. ‘We don’t know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID’s evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,’ Lessler said. Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings. ‘I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We’ll see what I think after the season’s done. But right now, I’m a little less sure,’ he said.” • Oh good. Seems like the best indicator would be reports of coughing on the Mommy blogs, at this point… * * * TABLE 1: Daily Covid Charts LEGEND 1) ★ for charts new today; all others are not updated. 2) For a full-size/full-resolution image, Command-click (MacOS) or right-click (Windows) on the chart thumbnail and “open image in new tab.” NOTES [1] (CDC) Good news!

Stats Watch Employment Situation: “United States Initial Jobless Claims” [Trading Economics]. “US initial jobless claims rose to 224,000 for the week ending November 30, from 213,000 in the previous week, above market expectations of 215,000 and marking the highest reading in six weeks. Despite this rise, the results still support the view that the US labor market remains at historically strong levels despite the aggressive tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve in the last quarters, adding leeway for the central bank to slow the pace of monetary loosening should inflation remain stubbornly high.” Employment Situation: “United States Challenger Job Cuts” [Trading Economics]. “US employers announced 57,727 job cuts in November 2024, slightly higher than 55,597 in October and 45,510 a year earlier. The Automotive sector announced the most job cuts (11,506, the highest monthly total since April).” * * * Manufacturing: “Boeing whistleblower sounds alarm over safety at satellite factory: “They’re not gonna listen to me until somebody dies” [CBS]. “Now, Garriott, 53, says, it’s the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management. ‘They’ve taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they’ve put it completely on profit and going fast,’ Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. ‘I’m afraid with Boeing in the hands that it’s in now down here, they’re not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.’ He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company’s Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a ‘toxic culture’ that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn’t properly secured — an incident so catastrophic he compared it to ‘a plane falling out of the sky.’ ‘One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,’ said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. ‘It’s the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.'” • Boeing dropped a satellite???? Manufacturing: “Boeing Plea Deal Over Fatal 737 Max Crashes Rejected by Judge” [Bloomberg]. “Boeing Co.’s plea deal with US prosecutors over two 737 Max jet crashes was rejected by a federal judge, who said plans for choosing an independent monitor minimized the court’s role and required the parties to consider the race of the person appointed. US District Judge Reed O’Connor on Thursday sided with family members of people killed during the crashes, who urged him to reject the agreement on the grounds that it failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the 346 fatalities.” • Oopsie. Manufacturing: “Boeing Defense Fighter Jet Unit Head Retires Amid Leadership Shake-Up” [Simple Flying]. “The head of Boeing Defense’s fighter jet division will step down after two years in the role. Steve Nordlund will be replaced by Dan Gillian, vice president and general manager of Mobility, Surveillance & Bombers, amid a challenging time for the company…. [Boeing Defense Systems] continues to lose money, posting losses of $2.3 billion in the third quarter. Much of this was due to fixed-cost contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker and T-7 Red Hawk programs.” • I bet there aren’t a whole lot of companies that lose money on defense work. Manufacturing: “Boeing Isn’t the Only Plane Maker With Problems. Airbus Just Laid Off 2,000 Workers” [Barron’s]. “Wednesday, Airbus announced it was laying off 2,043 workers in its Defense and Space business. The layoffs amount to about 5% of that business and should be completed by mid-2026. The reductions ‘aim to reduce the company’s fixed cost base, with almost all of the positions affected being so-called overhead positions,’ said Airbus in an emailed statement.” And: “Profits in Airbus’ defense segment have struggled, too, and the company is expected to post a loss for the unit in 2024. Operating profit margins in 2023 came in at 2%, down from 6% in 2020. Airbus’ defense sales in 2024 should amount to about $13 billion; Boeing’s defense business will approach $25 billion. What hasn’t been a problem for either company is commercial aerospace demand. Both companies have backlogs that stretch out years. Building the planes has been tougher.” The Bezzle: NEW: Amazon charges 48,000 DC residents in Wards 7 & 8 for full Prime membership while excluding them from Prime delivery benefits.

Tech: Yo, Elon: "I don't want to have to pay for Brain Premium to avoid getting Coca-Cola ads in my sleep." — 12 yo on why he won't get a Neuralink implant — Paul Graham (@paulg) December 4, 2024 Tech: “Federal Court Says Dismantling A Phone To Install Firmware Isn’t A ‘Search,’ Even If Was Done To Facilitate A Search” [TechDirt]. “[T]he narrative says the iPhone was ‘inoperable’ (to use HSI’s own words). But the DHS sent it out to a ‘partner forensic laboratory’ (I’m going to assume this was the FBI), which was able to finally obtain access to the phone by: …replacing its circuit board and re-flashing the device’s firmware. Now, that looks like the sort of thing not covered or considered by previous case law or the original warrant request. This is something else. This is another government party extensively modifying seized property to make it more receptive to phone-cracking efforts. One would think a court would need to be apprised of this opportunity before it became a reality, if for no other reason than the original warrant only authorized a search, not the literal cracking of a cell phone (or its casing, at least) to replace a circuit board and install new firmware. I think the defendant raises a good point. But I also think, given the lack of precedent, the court is not completely wrong to rule that reviving a device so it can be searched isn’t actually a search under the Fourth Amendment. To put it in other physical terms, no court would believe pulling a car out of the water after dredging a lake would be a search, even if the recovered vehicle was searched pursuant to a search warrant.” • Hmm. * * * Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 58 Greed (previous close: 57 Greed) [CNN].

A longtime UnitedHealth executive who left the company about 10 years ago said the company’s executives commonly received threats from people with grievances about UnitedHealth’s coverage policies. The executive, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss a sensitive topic, said unauthorized people would come to the company’s sprawling headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka and try to enter the buildings where executives’ offices are located. Years ago, employees entered the buildings using their badges, but the company added security checkpoints on the ground floor when the threats became more common.” • So the problem’s been festering a long time… What a surprise! And the headline: Thompson was not a “healthcare leader”; he was an insurance executive, some would say the very opposite. Further, the airport bookstore business section-style “leader” is, as ever, vacuous and noxious. Use the title, “CEO,” or the generic, “executives.” I read plenty of accounts in the online Covid community who are a thousand times the “leader” Thompson putatively was, and probably wouldn’t even use that word to describe themselves. Sheesh. “Wealthy Americans Are Now Paying for Their Own Personal Fire Hydrants” [Wall Street Journal]. “The latest sought-after home amenity? Personal fire hydrants. The logic is that when there’s a major disaster there may not be enough fire engines to protect every house in an area. If homeowners have their own hydrant ready to go—along with hoses, nozzles and adapters—and are trained to use it all, that could help reduce the number of homes destroyed. Real-estate agents say mentioning a personal fire hydrant in the marketing materials now helps sell homes….. Personal hydrants are part of a wider trend of homeowners taking wildfire prevention into their own hands. They’re putting in elaborate sprinkler systems, eliminating wood on the exteriors, clearing combustible landscaping and fireproofing roofs.” News of the Wired “The Surprising New History of Horse Domestication” [Scientific American]. “Scholars have long sought to understand how the unique partnership between humans and horses got its start. Until recently, the conventional wisdom was that horses were gradually domesticated by the Yamnaya people beginning more than 5,000 years ago in the grassy plains of western Asia and that this development allowed these people to populate Eurasia, carrying their early Indo-European language and cultural traditions with them.” But: “New genomic analyses led by Pablo Librado of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona and Orlando indicate that the ancestors of modern domestic horses originated in the Black Sea steppes around 2200 B.C.E., nearly 2,000 years later than previously thought. Although we do not yet know exactly the details of their initial domestication, it is clear based on the timing that these horses belonged to post-Yamnaya culture. Patterns in the ancient genomes suggest that in the early centuries of domestication, the horse cultures of the western steppe were selectively breeding these animals for traits such as strength and docility.” • Fascinationg detail on archeological evidence. Well worth a read. “How Typing Transformed Nietzsche’s Consciousness” [MIT Press]. “Amid all this hubbub of opinion and research into the man and his ideas, however, hardly anyone has commented on, or sought to explain, another aspect of Nietzsche: his productivity, and how it changed during his career because of his adoption of a new writing technology. Consider this: Nietzsche wrote four books between 1870 and 1881, or almost one every three years, which is pretty good. After 1881, however, he managed to deliver 10 manuscripts to his publisher in the seven years to 1888, whereupon he became too ill to write any longer. That was a book and a half per year, which is really good. By 1881 Nietzsche had become almost blind, an infirmity that would surely have hampered his longhand writing. How did he manage to improve his work rate? What he did was something seemingly out of character, given his views on modernity and science: He bought a typewriter. To be precise, he purchased a top-of-the-line portable Malling-Hansen writing ball, which was sent specially to him from its inventor in Copenhagen.” And: “The sudden mechanical punctuated strike of the typewriter contrasted starkly with the ruminative flow of the pen; the typewriter encouraged a binary decision, to depress the key or not; whereas the pen with its store of liquid ink, held by surface tension in the nib, or in a small reservoir in the fountain pen, was a more latent and nonmachinic technology….. The German philosopher of technology Friedrich Kittler has claimed that the analog typewriter in general was useful for certain forms of thought: the brief, the succinct, the forms that thrive on concision and quickness…. As Kittler saw it, a celebrated Nietzschean style comprising sustained reflection, long sentences, and complex reasoning had changed ‘from arguments to aphorisms, from thoughts to puns, from rhetoric to telegram style.’ Nietzsche was an early adopter of the technology. He took it to the heady realms of Continental philosophy and — if we consider his immense influence — began to change it through a creative mind that was reshaped by the keys that had replaced the pen.” • Also well worth a read. (In my own experience, the computer enabled me to finish the work, like the typewriter (and the pen before that). * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. “The Fight Has Only Just Begun” [The Progressive]. “Once upon a time, a majority of U.S. voters rejected a capable, competent, and intelligent daughter of Black and Indian immigrants in favor of a diminished, ignorant, racist son of a multimillionaire, proving that the United States remained a great country for old, white men.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I for one will greatly miss Kamala as the big fade makes her go away, she was essentially self-satirizing… only she didn’t know it~ Nixon made a comeback but Harris is no Nixon. I thought Nixon was the worst President ever but with the possible exception of Gerald “East Timor” Ford, every subsequent POTUS was worse. Harris is certainly no Shirley Chisholm. / ;) I have to say I read the teaser and thought they must be talking about some past historical figure, maybe someone from the Seminole people – only when I clicked the link to read further did I realize that they were talking about Harris. Those descriptive adjectives really threw me off. The Democrats did nothing wrong and chose the perfect candidate. It’s all the fault of the voters for not getting with the program. Don’t they know their place? Would you believe that the majority of those voters aren’t even credentialed? Watching a bit of news on CNBC this morning, which is reflecting on the wonderful Biden administration and a great economic stretch. Job markets, the stock indexes, yes that’s a few key indicators that for many in the US, daily life after the Covid 19 impaired period somehow did return to a more normal and routine as it were. Voters had it great under Joe and Kamala, why did the voters not understand this ( sarc ). To the bad, housing and rent is only more expensive. Those able to sell and relocate can either drop a large down payment or are able to absorb the increased mortgage rates. Most if not many daily items for an average American family are not only more expensive but any price declines are seemingly short lived and intermittent in reality. I have a lurking fear the Trump administration is going to miss the target and daily consumer goods and services are not going back in time to lower inflation days. Maybe there is some impact in oil and energy….to me that’s a pivotal input. Added thought, that article from the Progressive did have some wowsers in it. Yowza. Re: The Stoller framing. The lack of surprise by the elites is a byproduct of the white washing of history. “These violent delights have violent ends.” The “aww shucks Iowa corn bloated” routine is just a modern Lord and Lady nonsense. > aww shucks Iowa corn bloated Huh? Healthcare More on the UnitedHealth shooting: Coming later, or forgot to add it? One thing’s for sure, The Invisible Hand which has given so many the middle finger, just pulled the trigger. It’s most certainly there, and has been. The link works, both up top and on the main page. So I don’t know what the issue is. Almost wishing that Hunter did it, since he can’t be prosecuted for it and, for once, a Biden would have done something right. (Well, there’s Luna Khan, too, I guess.) Your mistyping of Luna now has me imagining Lina Khan as a Ravenclaw in the Ministry of Magic being put on loan to the US Govt. to handle the antitrust issue. “I’m sorry Senator, but we simply can’t allow them control that large of a marketshare. The snorkacks won’t survive.” “Yes, Senator, snorkacks. They’re quite essential you see. And do your best to stay healthy. There’s a herd of Thestrals following you around lately.” Ain’t toucg keybaords on tablwts granf? I notice that the guy did not seem to panic when his gun had a mishap but just got on with clearing it. Military training perhaps? I wonder if he was the same guy that planted that pipe bomb during the January 6th riots. They never found him either. Jan 6th… I made a mistake the other day when some PMC types were going off on that day and the lynching. I asked them politely if they knew the gallows were quite a distance from the capital. Remembering our host Lambert’s most excellent breakdown of that. Then explained how it seems against all logic that they could have done such a thing. Nope, I am so wrong, and was admonished appropriately. It seems to me, these people just make their own reality, and no amount of facts are going to change it. And we are the dumb ones. You get the same results when you discuss Ukraine, or Gaza, or economic issues in the US. There’s a crowd that refuses to even imagine another point of view. Regimes of truth and egomania: it’s hard to see one’s own privilege and role in reproducing modern slavery, especially when everyone and everything around you points at a convenient scapegoat: the stupid poor people. Ironic that much of liberal media discourse focuses on the critique of Othering (“it’s the migrants fault”) and then reproduces the same shit narratives (“it’s the poor people’s fault”)… It’s been 36 hours and no capture. The longer he eludes the coppers, the better the odds he gets away with it. Or at least goes into Unabomber/Eric Rudolph territory. I wonder if the FBI has been so caught up in looking for Rooshians hiding in the woods and Jan 6 cosplayers that they forgot how to catch an actual bad guy? Another for the “hot take” category from Taylor Lorenz: ‘People have very justified hatred toward insurance company CEOs because these executives are responsible for an unfathomable amount of death and suffering,’ she wrote on a different post. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14161595/washington-post-taylor-lorenz-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson.html (In my own experience, the computer enabled me to finish the work, like the typewriter (and the pen before that). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yes, when writing something by pen, I get occasional writer’s block or what if I want to change the wording around in ink, ye gads no. Loved my Selectric II and its distinctive purr when you turned it on, but again you couldn’t easily change things around as you can with this here QWERTY on my laptop. Famous film critic Pauline Kael couldn’t type or drive. She kept her daughter around to type up those cutting reviews for the New Yorker. She was sometimes accused of having a gushy “impressionsistic” style. Blame it on the ball point? Oh yes they did. Boeing has form. Thanks for that satellite info…..I am still amused, thank you sir. Perhaps they forgot that freely falling satellites only stay aloft if they are already in orbit. Sounds like yet another failed experiment in the ongoing attempt to reverse engineer Cavorite. And in a complete coincidence, I have been watching clips from that film the past two days- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHFwNOq59sE (3:42 mins) “the analog typewriter in general was useful for certain forms of thought: the brief, the succinct, the forms that thrive on concision and quickness” So Henry James didn’t own one then. I always found manual typewriters to be a lot of work. Perhaps Nietzsche was saving his fingers. Meanwhile back here in cyberworld I seem to go through keyboards far more often than I like. > So Henry James didn’t own one then. The later Henry James dictated to a stenographer. I don’t know what he did before that. And hence, indeed, the endless circuitousness, the never coming to what would, to some, have seemed to be the, or, at least, a point? I do apprehend the wending ways of the circumlocutious path your eminently enlightening erudition treads on its way to informing and, curiously, subtly encouraging the seeker after esoteric knowledge. Remain without fear; practice the vigilance of Argus with the pugnacity of Cerebrus. Her name was Theodora Bosanquet. She replaced a dour Scot who was an unsatisfactory blunt instrument, and expensive. Her book, “Henry James at Work”, was published in 1924 and is available at Libgen. She auditioned on his Remington though she was more familiar with other machines. Marshall McLuhan, in “Understanding Media”, relates that as James lay dying he asked her to operate the typewriter in an adjacent room so he could hear its sound once more before he passed away. Bosanquet’s editor says the onset of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in ’97 forced James to cease handwriting. Not really about physical keyboards, but about typesetting software for math and such. Game theorists using LaTEX (standard “math” typesetting software) need a lot of practice to draw nice diagrams. I could never get hang of it (I never did become a “real game throrist,” but I played one often enough, and I wondered about my old profs who were very prolific in churning out papers with wondrous diagrams. So, I asked one of them some years later. His response: I draw the diagrams on paper and we have staff that can take care of them. A bunch of lights lit up in my head at that moment. The Hit Point dice were loaded. I recently began a new remote position, performing data review and reconciliation as or after an integral data system upgrade….modern tech ( keyboard, PC displays ) does seem to have a relatively brief or useful life. The keyboard in use seems rather reluctant on certain key strokes. I’ll add it’s a modern inconvenience, of course just like your newer vehicle’s tire gauge going bonkers in a cold snap. My late Mom owned a manual that was indeed loud when it worked, an Underwood model I think. It’s probably collecting rust somewhere. >>Meanwhile back here in cyberworld I seem to go through keyboards far more often than I like. Like everything else, the quality of the keyboards has gone down. After my fourth apple keyboard in as many years, I bought a mechanical keyboard, which is still good after three years. I use a Model M from the late 80s that I converted to USB via the myriad tutorials online I will be dying of thirst in the water wars and this thing will still work. Shame that we can’t make anything that lasts like this anymore. Change the word from “can’t” to “won’t” and you will have penetrated to the heart of the matter. Bang on ambrit. It’s an important distinction to make. I wonder if our Civilization is suffering the effects of planned obsolescence. Question: What could be the “benefits” of financialization for Terran human History? I would have thought the stats we do have on wrongful arrests, cops killing people who called 911, and cops shooting dogs would “lay bare the security risks” for people who are not leadership. Guess not. “That raises an existential question for media outlets and for Democrats: Where will all those disillusioned eyes go?” Sing it, Peter, Paul, and Mary… Where have all…the blue eyes gone? Long time passing. Where have all…the blue eyes gone? To be gaslit. Where have all…the blue eyes gone? Gone to Blue Sky, every one. When will they ever learn? When will they…. ah screw it – I can’t satarize these morons better than they satarize themselves. Boing dropped a satellite???? Was the renaming intentional? It does have a ring to it : ) This has happened before. Back in the 80’s a DMSP got dropped, I think it might have been at the Cape for pre-launch checkout, or I can’t imagine how I would have heard about it. No trace of it online (of course), but it wasn’t Boeing (actually, Hughes, back then). The current prime contractor is Lockheed and/or Northrup, depending on the source, but this source says it was built by GE: https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/dmsp5d2QL.html > Boing dropped a satellite???? I did indeed type “Boing”! Sadly it went crash and not boing. “We should have continued something akin to the old Howard Dean plan to invest in all fifty states“. Aye. I was never particularly a Howard Dean fan, but I’ve always respected the work he did on the “50-state strategy”. The Democrats’ recent strategy of writing off entire states (and entire chunks of the US population) has resulted in a “big tent” that gets smaller every year. It’s a Big Tent, but you and I aren’t invited. It is a big tent in that it admits anyone with the right size check book, ideological convictions, unimportant. Yes, and they’re all pissing outside the tent. They’re drinking a lot of fluids in there, too. “Wealthy Americans Are Now Paying for Their Own Personal Fire Hydrants” Neo-liberalism on the march! We don’ need no stinking fire departments, just do it yourself. Elon’s probably already on it. Private and for profit fire companies were largely extinct in the US by 1875. But I guess along with anarchist style assassinations we’ll see that element of the gilded age return too. I write first drafts by hand. There’s a trance-like feel to it–bordering on the spiritual–that no other medium can quite match. I then type up what I’ve written, editing and revising as I do so. The process is rather efficient, in that you get two drafts done in rapid succession. It results in a higher quality second draft because you’re “rewriting” via the keyboard, which by way of having such a different feel than the pen, allows you to see possibilities (and errors!) you wouldn’t otherwise see if merely editing words already on the screen. Re: Politico article on Dem Leadership… 76, 77, and 79 years of age? No wonder the gaggle of committee chairs didn’t think Biden was too old to run for office again. I guess Feinstein is the model here. Dems only wants to leave office in a wheelchair, drooling on themselves. I Glitch McConnell isn’t far behind, but it seems as if there’s less of a skew towards the aged in the Republican party leadership. I don’t know if term limits are the answer here, but I wouldn’t mind telling people who are 75 and older that they can’t be in office anymore. The Lily in the City tweet has an interesting view of the future. I am assuming they are writing this as something happening after 2026. This because AOC is the only current office holder listed (Governor = Hochul, 10 = Goldman, 22 = Manning). All is speculation… Hmm. AOC moving to the senate? Maybe there’s a retirement in the works. Maybe a biopic about AOCs incredibly hard life. A real Harriet Alger story. With Rachel Zegler playing our scrappy heroine. A “moderne” video version of the obligatory “My Life” pre-Presidential run tome. AOC is just old enough to run for POTUS as of last October. Antoinette of Color might make the cut… Do you mean the Colour Barista, or Pocahauntus? When will the Melanin Deprived get their own grievance status? I don’t know where those maps came from, but they are wrong. Delgado ain’t the governor, Hochul is. It certainly doesn’t represent NY-22 which is basically Syracuse and Utica and points between. The redistricting was done in 2023 and in effect for 2024. Tenny is in NY-24, which wraps around NY-22. NY-22 flipped D and elected Mannion. Mannion, of course, outperformed Harris by a wide margin. Sorry didn’t realize that autocorrect made Manning out of Mannion. Since you were more clear on current positions in the state, I will add more current context for the where did they get that name calculation. Delgado is Lt. Governor and Brad Holman-Sigal is state Senator of the former 27th now 47th district which is part NY-10. Boeing Plea Deal Over Fatal 737 Max Crashes Rejected by Judge” [Bloomberg] This is wild: [The deal was] rejected by a federal judge, who said plans for choosing an independent monitor minimized the court’s role and required the parties to consider the race of the person appointed. Is this a great country, or what? Lambert: “In my own experience, the computer enabled me to finish the work, like the typewriter (and the pen before that).” I for one would be very interested to hear more details on this. Print outlets are faring even worse, with furious Democrats still canceling their Washington Post subscriptions nearly a month after owner Jeff Bezos spiked the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. One in 10 Washington Post subscribers have quit the paper since October, blowing a sizable hole in the paper’s already threadbare earnings. That’s a hilarious economic boycott. So the PMC class can stand together economically for a cause they believe in. But they certainly won’t do that as a class where it might help striking workers, say, quitting Amazon Prime, or not going to Starbucks. “Secret Service director touts changes as Congress presses him on Trump assassination attempt” ‘The acting director of the Secret Service said Thursday that the agency is “reorganizing and reimagining” its culture and how it operates following an assassination attempt against Donald Trump on the campaign trail.’ And what would have been the story if that assasin had succeeded in killing Trump? ‘The acting director of the Secret Service said Thursday that the agency is “reorganizing and reimagining” its culture and how it operates following the assassination of Donald Trump on the campaign trail.’ Am I just missing stories, or have the investigations into the two would-be Trump assassins been completely disappeared down the memory hole? It seems highly unusual that this has become such a non-topic. Sara Jane Moore got more attention for her misfire. Squeaky Fromme. ‘AG Brian Schwalb @DCAttorneyGen NEW: Amazon charges 48,000 DC residents in Wards 7 & 8 for full Prime membership while excluding them from Prime delivery benefits. Amazon failed to inform customers they were excluded. We are suing Amazon for deceiving DC residents into paying the same price for worse service.’ If this is the same story that I read about yesterday, those two areas excluded happen to be predominately black. Well the map indicates Anacostia, so yes, except the extreme southern which is JB Anacostia-Bolling, home to DIA and Marine-1. Though you can say pretty much the same about much of the district, at least NE and really east of Rock Creek. From I Watched the Democratic Collapse in Florida. I Fear It’s Happening Nationally. So I don’t think that dude understands why he lost Florida, either. At Unite the Country, we saw some of these issues among Hispanics even among the most loyal Democrats in primary states. Polling in both Illinois and Florida showed Democratic Hispanic primary voters starting to react negatively to the socialism talk that came out of our 2020 presidential primaries—so much so that we did pro-Biden mail calling out the “revolution” posture coming from some of the presidential candidates in both states to make it clear he was focused on bread-and-butter issues. Still, despite plenty of people screaming from the rafters, the Biden campaign largely ignored the growing problems associated with the rhetoric of the extreme left. In doing so, it let the narrative settle in. Trump’s gains among Hispanics in Florida were significant: from +27 Clinton to +7 Biden among Hispanics. Because the shift among that electorate was just three points nationally, national Democrats largely wrote it off as an outlier—Florida being Florida, and all. But eventually, we saw that Florida hadn’t been an outlier at all. (bold mine) Meanwhile the Florida Democrat Party fought tooth and nail against Grayson, who famously said that the Republican healthcare plan was “don’t get sick, if you do die quickly”, and went aggressivekly after the banks. The Democrat Party in Florida nuked him from orbit. As I recall, he was accused of influence peddling that pales in comparison to anything the Biden clan has done, but you know how that goes; if you aren’t on the same team, well, the rules are different. Or when Franken got MeToo’d. And on socialism; When was Biden running in 2020 no socialism? This dude must be high as a kite. This is why the Florida Democrat Party keeps losing; incapable of any intelligent reflection. But basically, we must get back to listening to the median voter. Bill Clinton got this. Barack Obama got this. Donald Trump gets this. That median voter probably isn’t the white “soccer mom” or “security mom” or “NASCAR dad” of elections past. Rather, the median voter today is just as likely to be a 38-year old African American father trying to figure out how to raise two kids, or a 28-year-old Hispanic woman struggling with affordable housing. Oh, this is a DLC-type. So, there you have it! We gotta get back to centrism. That’s the Florida Democrat Party. Not sure how centrism is gonna help that Hispanic woman struggling with affordable housing, to say nothing of food and healthcare! ObamaCare, mind you, was centrism! This dude is a tool. Its probably a pre-emptive strike to pollute the wells of analysis to prevent a “not-left-enough” counter-theory from getting a toe-hold. Somewhere, the old New Dealer Claude Pepper must be shaking his head. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Pepper Taibbi article today, public excerpt: Pardon Me, But This Is Bullshit Joe Biden or whoever is running the White House can absolve anyone they please, but Anthony Fauci needs to stand tall before the man. The world is owed answers https://www.racket.news/p/pardon-me-but-this-is-bullshit “NEW: Amazon charges 48,000 DC residents in Wards 7 & 8 for full Prime membership while excluding them from Prime delivery benefits.” Try living anywhere outside of a city….. Amazon seems to make it even slower if you don’t pay for prime. With prime it might take a week, without it’ll take 2. Remarkably, perhaps, in the Tucker Carlson interview with Russian FM Lavrov, Mr. Lavrov stated that there are active back-channel communications between the U.S. and Russia, but that, through them, the U.S. is repeating the themes of more public facing messages. Can you imagine being a Russian radar operator and hearing Western media headlines? The interview is very worth watching. Thanks! “them Western diplomats running away from Lavrov like children” – I liked that story. It reminded me of luncheons in the entertainment industry. Everyone got together and then spoke only to those they would speak to normally. And when there was someone you had an argument with (e.g. someone you had fucked over business-wise) – avoid, avoid, avoid. It’s the idiotic idea to simulate courtesy in the face of public. As if this were some Austian novel. But of course in truth it´s the same dumb trick as Lavrov shakes his head over – they run away and by avoiding him they think some Reaper Drone 10.000 miles away will take care of the poblem. Instead of admitting a mistake and talk it over with Lavrov in person. But those people can´t actually communicate like decent human beings. Be it the political class or entertainment folks. Which makes an argument for why Hollywood, the media and politics are so close in the West. They share the same sick rules of conduct and pathologic mindset. What he was picturing, it really felt familiar! Ref: CEO dead from lead poisoning … I’ve wondered when they might get on the menu sans the usual going postal event or political targets. I mean when the Übermensch Homo economicus stalwarts would – like most of human history – like the priests/administrators of the elites in antiquity start being taken out by the unwashed. Maybe like M Moors old TV the Awful Truth people will start live streaming these events or MSM will do it for them post event. Anywho … social psychology suggests such events can lead to more of them … till then … Martyanov a bit on infantry tactics by the RUs. The topic starts at about TC 22:00 Syria and Clockwork. My latest. Why it is hard to fight a combined arms war. https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2024/12/syria-and-clockwork.html So imagine the rage from those that were forced take an experimental, non-sterilizing shot for which the manufacturer has liability immunity, or possibly lose employment, and face homelessness or starvation. It’s not just health insurance that people are angry about, although anger over that is more universal; those on the left were fully onboard with mandating non-sterilizing shots, because brunch. And The Science ™. The American Electorate was given the choice between a Pseudo-Eugenicist Party and a Real Eugenicist Party. The result was predictable. Caitlin Johnstone Phony Anti-Establishment Schtick https://consortiumnews.com/2024/12/05/caitlin-johnstone-phony-anti-establishment-schtick/ “In 2028 U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will probably run for president campaigning on the Democratic Party version of the same faux-populist message, just as Bernie Sanders did. This dynamic poses a major obstacle to those who yearn for real revolutionary change. It’s becoming increasingly necessary to not just stand against the status quo but against the fraudulent political factions which pretend to oppose it. It’s no longer enough to reject establishment politics and media, we also need to reject the fake anti-establishment politics and media which seek to herd a discontented populace away from meaningful revolutionary movements. There are probably people reading this right now who’ve fallen into this very trap, who started reading my stuff because they see me opposing wars and criticizing the media and assume I support the same things they support, even as they throw their support behind a fraudulent political movement that’s ultimately designed to keep the wars going and make the mass media propaganda more effective. Last time Trump was president I’d always get his fuzzbrained empire simps trying to convince me their guy was ending the wars and fighting against the deep state, twisting themselves into all kinds of cognitive pretzels when I’d present them with hard evidence to the contrary.” Your email address will not be published.

The increased size of leveraged MicroStrategy (MSTR) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the flows they attract are having a more pronounced effect on the company's stock and crypto markets than before, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday. These ETFs played a significant role in amplifying the stock's near-60% rise in November, the bank said. November saw a record of almost $11 billion flow into U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC), spot ether (ETH) and leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs combined, the report said, with the leveraged MSTR ETFs accounting for $3.4 billion, or almost a third, of the total. "This highlights the rising impact of MicroStrategy's leveraged ETFs in crypto markets via facilitating MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchase program," analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The company founded by Michael Saylor has spent $13 billion buying bitcoin this quarter alone, the report noted. "The growth in these ETFs is fuelled by increasing investor demand in obtaining amplified exposure to bitcoin through an ETF wrapper," the authors wrote, adding that this would not normally be available to retail investors. MicroStrategy shares allow investors who are restricted from investing in spot bitcoin ETFs to obtain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency, and due to the software company's inclusion in benchmarks such as the MSCI World index, the stock benefits from sizable passive flows. The company's share price also reflects investor optimism about the potential profitability of MicroStrategy's corporate strategy, including its plans to become a bitcoin bank and develop BTC applications, and this adds a premium to the firm's valuation, the report added. MicroStrategy currently meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index, according to Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer.

Type search term(s) and press enter Popular Searches December 5, 2024 Peter Greenwood for Quanta Magazine Podcast Host December 5, 2024 Death might seem like a pure loss, the disappearance of what makes a living thing distinct from everything else on our planet. But zoom in closer, to the cellular level, and it takes on a different, more nuanced meaning. There is a challenge in simply defining what makes an individual cell alive or dead. Scientists today are working to understand the various ways and reasons that cells disappear, and what these processes mean to biological systems. In this episode, cellular biologist Shai Shaham talks to Steven Strogatz about the different forms of cell death, their roles in evolution and disease, and why the right kinds and patterns of cell death are essential to our development and well-being. Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, TuneIn or your favorite podcasting app, or you can stream it from Quanta. [Theme plays] STEVE STROGATZ: In the second that it took you to hit play on this episode, a million cells in your body died. Some were programmed to expire in natural, regulated processes, such as apoptosis. Some terminated their own lives after infection, to stop viral invaders from spreading. Others suffered physical damage and went through necrosis, their membranes splitting open and their contents spilling out. We know there are nearly a dozen different ways for our cells to kick the bucket. And learning how to control these processes can make all the difference in the world to a sick patient. [Theme continues] I’m Steve Strogatz, and this is “The Joy of Why,” a podcast from Quanta Magazine, where I take turns at the mic with my cohost, Janna Levin, exploring some of the biggest unanswered questions in math and science today. In this episode, we ask cellular biologist Shai Shaham, how can the death of a cell help other cells around it? And how do these insights help us understand life itself? Shai is a professor at The Rockefeller University, where he studies programmed cell death during animal development and the complex role that glial cells play in the nervous system. [Theme ends] Shai, welcome to “The Joy of Why.” Shai Shaham SHAI SHAHAM: Thank you for having me, Steve. STROGATZ: Thank you for joining us. I’m very curious to learn more about cell death. So I thought maybe we could start by talking about the lives of cells. What are the sorts of things that cells do that tell us they’re alive? SHAHAM: So that’s actually a fairly complicated question. It really depends on the specific assay that you use to ask whether the cell is alive or not. So for example, if a cell is moving from one place to another, you might say the cell is alive. But if the cell is sitting and not going anywhere, you have to ask, what does it mean to be alive? Is it metabolizing food? Is it producing signals to other cells? But others would say that these sorts of things can also be the hallmarks of cells that are just chemically active, but not performing any biological function. The whole field of cell death is plagued by this question of defining what a dead cell is. And, really, the best definition that at least I’ve been most comfortable with is if the cell is just completely gone, then I know it’s dead. Otherwise, it’s very difficult to say. STROGATZ: It’s interesting that it’s so subtle. I think many of us think of cells as dividing. And I’m wondering, is that a crucial aspect of being alive? Does a cell have to divide to be considered alive? SHAHAM: You would say certainly that if a cell is dividing, it is alive. The question is though, if it’s not dividing, is it not alive? And I think that the answer to that is really dependent on context. So, for example, you can have bacterial spores that survive for years without dividing. And then when the time is right, they emerge from the spore configuration that they’re in and start dividing and replicating themselves. And so for all of that period of time, which could be even decades, was the cell dead or alive? The whole field of cell death is plagued by this question of defining what a dead cell is. There was an example near and dear to my heart, since we work on C. elegans, which is a nematode worm. And there was a recent description of a nematode that was extracted from permafrost in Siberia where it froze about 40,000 years ago and was revived back in the lab. And so you ask yourself, was that whole organism alive or dead for 40,000 years? STROGATZ: Unbelievable. That’s so interesting. I mean, we have this concept in ordinary language of suspended animation. The spores that you talked about, they’re waiting to come back to life, would be the common-sense way of saying it. But what are they when they’re in suspended animation? So that brings up this question of irreversibility. SHAHAM: Yeah, absolutely, I mean, I think you’re struggling with something that we in the field struggle with a lot. At the end of the day, it all boils down to the assay. So let’s say that you had that spore that was sitting around for a hundred years waiting to start dividing. If you observed the spore, let’s say, at year 30, and decided to spend a few weeks looking at it, it would look dead, for all intents and purposes. And it’s only if you waited the full 100 years and then saw it emerging that you would say, ah, actually it was alive. But if we have another assay where we’re looking at metabolism, or we’re looking at the ability to accumulate mutations in the genome, or the ability to signal to other cells. If the cell is doing stuff in terms of your assay, then you would consider it alive. But it’s a very operational definition. I don’t think there’s much point in involving the mystical here. STROGATZ: It’s clean, isn’t it, to say that it’s sort of operationally alive relative to certain assays. That seems fairly clear cut. We could measure, is it metabolizing or not? Is it dividing or not? In trying to circumscribe life and death, let me bring in a few other categories of things to think about, like parts of a cell. Can parts of a cell die, or does it have to be in the nature of death that the whole cell has to die? SHAHAM: So, certainly not. If you recall what I said earlier, I’m most comfortable defining a dead cell as a cell that’s just not there at all. And certainly, we have situations where parts of a cell disappear. And this can be either programmed events, which is supposed to happen, or it can be due to injury or some mishap. There are cases in development where axons grow out of a neuron. So an axon, it’s a long thin process that comes out of a neuron whose job basically is to connect to other neurons to make our brain work. These axons, during a normal part of development, might decide to start retracting. And this retraction, in fact, is given the name “dying back.” So operationally here, the axon has no function and physically it’s actually disappearing. And so you would argue that part of the cell is actually dying. STROGATZ: So, you mentioned something about programmed cell death, which is the area I want to start getting into with you next. For instance I read about something called necrosis. What happens if a cell becomes necrotic, or what is that kind of death? I would say that people in the field often equate programmed cell death with apoptosis, but actually that’s not entirely accurate…. we know of basically three bona fide examples of genetically programmed cell death pathways. SHAHAM: So let me distinguish between two kinds of cell death. So there’s a cell death, which is a consequence of a genetic program, which is present in the DNA, in the genes of a cell, which is dedicated to executing the demise of the cell. So this is a process which has been evolutionarily selected and which has been passed on from one generation of a cell to the next generation. And the job of this pathway is specifically to allow a cell to commit suicide. Then there’s another category of cell death, which I would put in the category of what happens to a cell when you step on it. And there are myriad ways, as you can imagine, of hurting a cell in a non-natural way. Necrosis is one of those ways. It’s a very ill-defined term, but when people usually talk about it, they refer to an unregulated type of cell death that’s not encoded in our genes and involves swelling of the cell, often formation of membrane whorls or substructures within the cell that are abnormal, and eventually leakage of the content of the cell into the environment. STROGATZ: And I suppose that provokes a reaction from the immune system? SHAHAM: Yes, so the difference generally between the genetically programmed death events and the foot-stepping-on-the-cell type of events, is that the former are designed in a very clean way to not perturb the surrounding environment. In fact, they do everything they possibly can to minimize any damage to surrounding cells when they die. The other type of death, though, often elicits harsh reactions, either from neighboring cells, or, if the animal has an immune system, from immune cells that try to cope with the damage that the exploding cell has unleashed on its environment. STROGATZ: I mentioned this term “apoptosis” earlier, this genetically programmed style of death that’s relatively clean. Am I getting that right? That’s what we’re talking about now? SHAHAM: I would say that people in the field often equate programmed cell death with apoptosis, but actually that’s not entirely accurate. Apoptosis is one form of programmed cell death. We’ve discovered one in our own lab, a different one called “linker cell–type death” or LCD. And there’s at least one other type of cell death that I know of, which has been studied by a colleague of mine in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. So we know of basically three bona fide examples of genetically programmed cell death pathways. STROGATZ: Do you want to give us a picture of them? What should we visualize if a cell is undergoing any of those three? There are examples where individual animals die as a way to better the entire collective. SHAHAM: So “apoptosis,” that term was actually first coined by [John F.R.] Kerr and [Andrew] Wyllie in a paper in the early 1970s. It’s related to a Greek word, which has to do with the falling of leaves from the tree, to make the connection to some sort of a death process. And so it’s characterized by the condensation of chromatin, or of the DNA, inside the nucleus. It becomes very compact and it cannot carry out its functions because it is so compact. In addition, the cell cytoplasm, so the bulk of the cell, seems to shrink. And often the organelles, like the mitochondria that are present in the cytoplasm, will rupture. But this happens generally fairly late in the process. Overall the whole thing happens very rapidly. It’s only if you sit there and count the number of cells over time that are undergoing this process that you realize how prevalent it is. So overall you have a very compact demolition process, which gets rid of the cell and then these cells that have died on their surface have special signals that are known in the field as “eat me” signals, and they signal to neighboring cells or to specialized phagocytic cells to come and literally eat them up and degrade them. And so most programmed cell death follows that path. And apoptosis in particular has the features that I mentioned. The linker cell–type death is in some sense almost like a mirror image of apoptosis. There’s very little chromatin condensation. In fact, the hallmark of this cell death is that there’s very open chromatin, and then organelles, rather than waiting till the end of the death process to exhibit defects, right from the beginning tend to swell. But, importantly, this type of cell death still presents “eat me” signals on its surface, and these cells are still cleared by either neighboring cells or specialized phagocytes that degrade it. STROGATZ: I’m curious to hear a little more about this second one. Because number one, I never heard of it before. And number two, my first scientific paper in my own career was about applying math to the structure of the chromatin fiber. So when you mention linker, are you referring to the linker DNA between nucleosomes? SHAHAM: Actually I’m not. This cell death, we actually discovered it in the nematode C. elegans. And it’s the death of a single cell in the male of the animal that’s called the “linker cell.” And the reason it’s called the linker cell is because it connects the developing male gonad to the exit channel, which will allow sperm to be released from the male during mating. And this cell basically stands as a plug in between the gonadal tube and the exit channel. And so the animal eliminates it using this novel linker cell–death program, and that allows these two tubes to fuse together so that sperm can exit. And what we’ve discovered is that what you can see by electron microscopy, which allows you to view cells at very high magnification and with specific types of contrast, this type of cell death actually is not relegated only to this one cell in nematodes, but it’s also extremely prevalent in developing mammals and in humans. In fact, much of the cell death that happens in our nervous system has this shape. How does a bacteria decide that it needs to die? And in addition to the features that I mentioned, one other prominent feature that this cell death has is that the nuclear envelope acquires these indentations, or “crenellations,” as we call them, where it just looks very wavy. And this is really a hallmark of a lot of cell death that happens in human disease also. And so we’re very curious about the possibility that linker cell death might play a role in human disease, where, in the diseased state, you’re inappropriately activating this type of cell death when you’re not supposed to. STROGATZ: I do want to come back to this question about cell death and its implications for human disease. But if it’s okay, I’d like to keep enumerating various pathways of cell death because there are a few that have to do with defensive functions. I’m thinking of cases where viruses or other pathogens are causing infections or other sorts of problems, and cell death is happening in response to attack. SHAHAM: So many of these actually have a lot in common with apoptosis and the name signifies just the context. So, for example, “pyroptosis” is a type of apoptotic cell death that happens during an inflammatory response. And so the “pyro” is supposed to allude to the inflammation or this fiery kind of state. And the idea there, basically, is that you might have a situation where a cell is infected with a virus or a bacterium, and it’s to the benefit of the host organism that the cell off itself, so that the rest of the organism doesn’t get exposed to the bacterium or to the virus. There’s many pathways that are dedicated towards eliminating cells that are infected besides what you might consider apoptotic-type cell death. For example, when a particular form of T-cell called a cytotoxic T-cell recognizes a cell that has been infected with a virus, it will release proteins called perforins whose name is exactly what they sound like, they basically make pores. And so they release these perforin proteins that make holes in the membranes of the target cell. And that will trigger either an apoptotic response or just leakage in general out of the cell. And eventually the cell just disintegrates and gets eaten by circulating phagocytes. So this type of response is similar to the type of thing that happens in complement-mediated cell death, another type of reaction that our body has in response to a cell that has been invaded by a foreign organism. And often it’s a very complicated cascade of proteins that are circulating in the blood that will eventually lead to a coating of an infected cell with a certain type of protein, which is an “eat me” signal for phagocytes. So the cell itself is not destroyed from within, as in some of these other examples that we’ve been talking about, but it’s just marked as a bad seed, so that the phagocytes can come and take care of it. In embryogenesis, all vertebrates have a very prominent cellular webbing that connects the digits. And in vertebrates like us, for example, there’s massive cell death that happens in that interdigital webbing that eliminates those cells. And that’s why we have well-separated digits. STROGATZ: So the impression I’m getting from all of this discussion is that when cells either carry out these programs or allow themselves to be marked as “eat me” cells, it’s for the greater good. That this is to help other cells around them or other tissues. It feels like this is something that is multicellular. If you were a single cell, you wouldn’t have the same incentive to do this sort of thing. It’s in the context of being in a multicellular organism that these processes happen. Is that wrong? SHAHAM: You’re on the right track. I wouldn’t necessarily restrict it to a multicellular organism. You just need to be in a situation where you have a conglomeration of cells that need each other in order to survive. So it’s true that in a multicellular organism, you need to exercise this principle of “I might need to die for the greater good,” but it’s also true in bacteria. So for example, bacteria tend to form what are known as biofilms, basically sheets of many bacteria lined up next to each other. Under starvation conditions, when the biofilm doesn’t have enough food to feed everybody, a subset of the bacteria there decide to just destroy themselves and serve as nutrients for the other bacteria that are surviving. Often there’s wars between the bacteria and they will invoke killing mechanisms in your gut. So I think the principle that you hit on that you need to be in a multicellular environment is important, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be within a single organism. STROGATZ: All right. So multicellularity broadly construed, then, not necessarily in a multicellular organism, but [in] multicellular life in its various forms, these issues come up. SHAHAM: In the context of animals, there are examples where the general principles that we’ve found could be very meaningful. So one place to look, for example, are ants. So in an ant colony, it’s essentially what’s called a “superorganism,” where each ant plays an important role within the colony. And often, it’s true that ants have to die in order to generate an interesting structure that’s important for the survival of the colony or to even just provide nourishment. So there’s these wonderful movies that you can find on YouTube and on National Geographic where you can see ants forming a bridge so that other ants can travel across this bridge. And often those ants that are on the bridge will die. And their exoskeleton is what serves as the part of the bridge on which other ants march. So there are examples where individual animals die as a way to better the entire collective. STROGATZ: That’s interesting. One other thing that I was wondering about, because you did mention C. elegans, the wonderful little worm, only about a millimeter long, that has taught us so much about biology, from development, genetics, behavior, neurobiology, aging. It’s incredible what we’ve learned from this little critter. And some of our listeners may not be familiar with this creature. Can you just tell us a little about C. elegans and also how it has helped us learn about processes involved in cell death and their significance? SHAHAM: Sure. If you want to study cell death it would be really useful to know that at a given moment in time, at a given location within the animal, a cell is going to die. Because if you have that predictability, you are able to manipulate the system ahead of time to ask all sorts of questions. That predictability is absent in most model systems. However, in nematodes, and specifically in the nematode C. elegans, this is precisely what we can do. So C. elegans has the remarkable property that the pattern of cell divisions from the fertilized egg all the way to the adult is entirely identical, except for a very small number of exceptions, between individuals of the species. And superimposed on this cell division pattern, is also a pattern of cell death which is exactly the same. The way we can demonstrate that the pattern is the same, is that we can give cells names in C. elegans. So we can say this cell is called Moe and this one is called Curly — but actually we give them much more boring names, like ASE or NSM or CEP sheath. Whereas in us, or in other vertebrates, you really can’t name cells and have them be the same cell in every animal. We can tell you with precision that the cell called Curly will die four hours and 20 minutes after the fertilized egg began dividing. And we can tell you for sure that it’s going to take 25 minutes for that death process to occur. This detail was worked out in the late 1970s and early 1980s by two extraordinary scientists, Bob Horvitz and John Sulston. And they determined the entire pattern of cell divisions from the fertilized oocyte all the way to adulthood. And as they were watching these cell divisions unfold, they realized that there were cells that would eventually disappear. And those were the dying cells. And so we know that in, for example, a developing C. elegans hermaphrodite worm, 1,090 somatic cells precisely are generated. And of those exactly 131 cells will die, leaving the animal with a complement of 959 somatic cells. And based on this precision, we can now do all sorts of genetic studies and cell biological studies, where we can look at the same exact cell over and over and over again to try to understand what drives the cell death process. And really, I think this is the biggest advantage of using C. elegans to study cell death. STROGATZ: So in case anyone is wondering, they’re not hard to capture, right? They’re just like, if you pick up a handful of dirt, there’s a lot of these C. elegans in there? SHAHAM: So nematodes and C. elegans in particular is found all over the world. And in fact, when I started my laboratory at Rockefeller, the first thing that I decided to go and do was to see if I could isolate the Rockefeller version of C. elegans. So I went out and I got a bunch of dirt and I put it on petri plates that have agar, that’s how we grow the worms, and just waited for them to emerge. And indeed we found them. And I was very excited to find the Rockefeller isolate, only later to find out that Rockefeller actually imports its dirt from upstate New York. So in fact, they were not local C. elegans. They were upstate New York C. elegans. Cell death is associated with virtually every disease state in humans. STROGATZ: Country worms coming down to the city. So the story you’ve just told is so remarkable and amazing. The machine-like development of this creature from the time it’s fertilized oocyte to an adult. And then you mentioned that for a mouse or for us, it’s not as predictable. I’m sure some people must be wondering, aren’t they very special in the whole zoo of life? Convince us that studying this strange worm is really relevant to us. SHAHAM: First, I should start out by saying that they are very special. So there is something that they do that other organisms don’t. And I think it’s important not to gloss over that. But in terms of the relatedness to other animals, you need look no further than the DNA of the animal and the genome. So the sequence of DNA nucleotides, which code for genes in our genome, are essentially the same in C. elegans as they are in us. For example, the process of apoptosis is executed by a protein called a caspase. It’s a protein whose job is to cleave other proteins, and the protein is encoded by a gene, and this gene is pretty much the same gene in worms as it is in people. if you want to follow Nietzsche’s line of thought, “Man is worm.” STROGATZ: I’m not familiar with that quote. Is that the real quote? SHAHAM: It is. It’s in German, but this is the translation of it. STROGATZ: Okay. I never thought of him as a cell biologist, but maybe he was on to something. We’ll be right back after this message. [Break] STROGATZ: Welcome back to “The Joy of Why.” So, I wanted to explore a variety of laboratory systems for looking at cell death from, say, bacteria in a plate, to C. elegans, up to more complex organisms. So, what is the right scale for us to be studying these questions of cell death? SHAHAM: I think it is important to look at all different scales. I guess the smallest scale is the cell itself and certainly there are examples of bacteria where cells die and those are very important to understand for health reasons, but also just as basic questions of curiosity. How does a bacteria decide that it needs to die? Working in bacteria is a wonderful system. Working in a cell culture might also tell us a lot. So if we take cells from, let’s say, a human or from a mouse, and put them in culture and let them divide, and die within the culture, we might not learn about the context in which they’re executing the cell death, but we might be able to learn a lot about the molecules and about the signals that are involved in telling cells whether to die or not to die. And once we’ve established some principle in this simplified cell culture, we can then try to move our understanding into an organism where we could, for example, explore the role of a gene that we discovered in cell culture and see what effects it might have on the organism. In an organismal level, there’re aspects of cell death that you can’t really explore in other settings, which has to do with collective phenomena of cell death. So not just a single cell dying, but aggregates of cells. And that’s probably most beautifully demonstrated in the field of developmental biology, and particularly the process of morphogenesis. So that is the process by which animals or any living organism that’s multicellular get their form, their shape. Rodin is famous for saying that he was trying to reveal the statue that was within the slab of stone that he’s carving. [Editor’s note: That may have been Michelangelo.] And it’s the same principle in terms of cell death. We have this mass of cells and in many cases, some of them die to be able to form a particular shape. And perhaps the most famous example is the development of the digits in vertebrates. So, in embryogenesis, all vertebrates have a very prominent cellular webbing that connects the digits. And in vertebrates like us, for example, there’s massive cell death that happens in that interdigital webbing that eliminates those cells. And that’s why we have well-separated digits. Cancers are cells where somehow the programs that allow the body to eliminate these harmful cells have stopped doing this, and the cells are inappropriately surviving. STROGATZ: So you’re talking about formation of fingers or toes here. SHAHAM: Yes, exactly. But in the duck, for example, a lot of that cell death doesn’t take place, and that’s why they have webbed feet. STROGATZ: That’s amazing. Not that they were growing the web, it’s that the other creatures were sculpting away their web. Aren’t there genetic variants? Or I think some of my relatives have said, look at my toes, I have webs between these toes. SHAHAM: So those are probably vestigial structures that did not completely get eliminated during embryogenesis. STROGATZ: Let’s move on to more of a human-centered point of view here about cell death. maybe related to healthcare issues, medical care. For instance, would knowing more about cell death help us reverse organ failure or anything else in which lots of cells in a tissue might be dying? SHAHAM: So cell death is associated with virtually every disease state in humans. And broadly, you can categorize them into two kinds of problems. One group are diseases where there’s too much cell death going on, diseases like organ infarction. Like, for example, when you have a heart attack, cells in your heart will die, or in neurodegenerative conditions where cells in the brain will die and then you develop Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. And then there’s the opposite side of the spectrum, diseases where cells that should be dying are not dying. And that’s essentially what all cancers are. So cancers are cells where somehow the programs that allow the body to eliminate these harmful cells have stopped doing this, and the cells are inappropriately surviving. And so really this, in principle, could touch every major disease. Now, this is not to say that cell death is the root cause of every disease. But certainly there are cases where if we could block the cell death from happening, it might at least give us a fighting chance to treat the cells that otherwise would be completely gone. In terms of utility, there’s been a number of drug studies looking at compounds that can either inhibit or promote cell death in various disease contexts. For example, in the clinic now, there are drugs whose job is to trigger cell death in specific tumor settings. And these drugs arose from our understanding of how cell death happens and the specific molecules involved. STROGATZ: It makes me wonder with your earlier mention of markers on cell surfaces that say “eat me,” whether that can be used on cancer cells, maybe in a kind of cancer immunotherapy or something like that. SHAHAM: At the moment, there isn’t anything that’s specifically in trials to look at these “eat me” signals. But what you can do is you can create your own “eat me” signals. So if you can discover something on the surface of a cancer cell that marks it uniquely from all other cells, because you only want to eliminate the cancer cell, you don’t want to get rid of all the other cells in your body. So if you can identify this you can generate a specific antibody which would trigger, for example, an apoptotic response in the cell to which it binds. As long as there’s a question to be asked and a way that I can imagine to solve it, that will bring me into work every day. And in fact there is really an incredible revolution afoot in the treatment of cancers using what’s known as immunotherapy. And this is precisely what this is based on. So the idea here is to allow the body to identify specific unique markers for tumor cells, generate an immune response towards those, and then immune cells will go to these cells and destroy them using a variety of different ways that we mentioned already in our conversation. STROGATZ: We’ve been focusing a lot on what is known or what we’ve discovered in the past few decades about cell death. I wonder if you have a few questions that you’d love to see answered in your lifetime or where you think the great, exciting open areas might still lie in this field? SHAHAM: Yeah, I think there’s an enormous amount for us to learn. So as you alluded [to] in the beginning of our conversation, a very commonly studied cell death process is called apoptosis. And we for many years thought that this process was sufficient to explain many of the types of cell death–related events that happen during the development of animals. But work over the last couple of decades has demonstrated that you can completely eliminate this cell death program from the genome of an animal. And yet, the animal can still survive just fine. And so what that means is that there must be other ways to kill cells that are out there. Now, one way might be this linker cell–type death, which I mentioned, but it may not be the only way. There may be other ways. And so that whole black box of what other programs are out there is an incredibly fascinating direction that will definitely deserve our attention, particularly if we wish to make cell death an important angle of attack in disease. There is another big question that we would like to understand. So I told you in C. elegans, we know precisely which cells are going to die at any given moment. We don’t know this in vertebrates. But we would love to be able to understand how, if you have two neighboring cells in a human, why one will undergo cell death and another will not. And we don’t at all understand that. So I think this becomes a much bigger question. It’s a question that has to do with how cells respond to their environment. And cell death in this case would just be a readout. But certainly still an incredibly fascinating question and wholly unanswered. STROGATZ: Wonderful. Those are some great directions. Finally, you as an individual scientist in this great enterprise, is there something about your own research that particularly gives you joy? SHAHAM: I love discovering stuff. I have always been interested in finding new things that no one has found out before. And in some sense, the specific details of what it is that I’m finding are not even that important. Because I think once you get into the details, everything seems interesting and exciting. As long as there’s a question to be asked and a way that I can imagine to solve it, that will bring me into work every day. And it still does. STROGATZ: I know that feeling, and I sometimes will tell my own graduate students that — that it almost doesn’t matter what the question is, the process of discovery is so fulfilling, and everything becomes interesting once you start looking at it deeply enough. SHAHAM: Absolutely. Rare, but fulfilling. Science has proven over and over how discoveries that seemed unimportant and fringe at any moment turn out to be all the rage just a couple of decades later. STROGATZ: But what about something that Francis Crick said one time, that it’s just as easy to work on an important problem as a trivial or uninteresting or unimportant problem. Do you ever think about that aspect, that you want to work on things that matter in some external sense? SHAHAM: I’ve often thought of that quote in trying to decide what my next goal should be. But I will tell you that, in my opinion, I lack the hubris to decide what’s important and what’s not. And I think science has proven over and over how discoveries that seemed unimportant and fringe at any moment turn out to be all the rage just a couple of decades later. And this could be true in biology. This could be true in physics. This could be true in mathematics. And so I think that by narrowing myself to this particular scheme that Crick suggested, I might be excluding areas of discovery that could be even more exciting than what I can imagine. And I just think my imagination, good as it is, is just not good enough to be able to foretell the future like that. [Theme plays] STROGATZ: I’m getting a great deal of joy personally from that answer. The virtue of modesty, it may actually be a very practical thing for exactly the reason that you described, that we don’t really know. I could talk to you all day, Shai. This has been wonderful. SHAHAM: Okay, Steve. I really enjoyed it. STROGATZ: We’ve been speaking with cell biologist and neuroscientist Shai Shaham.

Time Published: 2024-12-05T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
December 05, 2024 09:00 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced the availability of its 3.5D eXtreme Dimension System in Package (XDSiP™) platform technology, enabling consumer AI customers to develop next-generation custom accelerators (XPUs). The 3.5D XDSiP integrates more than 6000 mm2 of silicon and up to 12 high bandwidth memory (HBM) stacks in one packaged device to enable high-efficiency, low-power computing for AI at scale. Broadcom has achieved a significant milestone by developing and launching the industry's first Face-to-Face (F2F) 3.5D XPU. The immense computational power required for training generative AI models relies on massive clusters of 100,000 growing to 1 million XPUs. These XPUs demand increasingly sophisticated integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance while minimizing power consumption and cost. Traditional methods like Moore's Law and process scaling are struggling to keep up with these demands. Therefore, advanced system-in-package (SiP) integration is becoming crucial for next-generation XPUs. Over the past decade, 2.5D integration, which involves integrating multiple chiplets up to 2500 mm² of silicon and HBM modules up to 8 HBMs on an interposer, has proven valuable for XPU development. However, as new and increasingly complex LLMs are introduced, their training necessitates 3D silicon stacking for better size, power, and cost. Consequently, 3.5D integration, which combines 3D silicon stacking with 2.5D packaging, is poised to become the technology of choice for next-generation XPUs in the coming decade. Broadcom’s 3.5D XDSiP platform achieves significant improvements in interconnect density and power efficiency compared to the Face-to-Back (F2B) approach. This innovative F2F stacking directly connects the top metal layers of the top and bottom dies, which provides a dense and reliable connection with minimal electrical interference and exceptional mechanical strength. Broadcom’s 3.5D platform includes IP and proprietary design flow for efficient correct-by-construction of 3D die stacking for power, clock and signal interconnects. Key Benefits of Broadcom's 3.5D XDSiP Broadcom’s lead F2F 3.5D XPU integrates four compute dies, one I/O die, and six HBM modules, leveraging TSMC's cutting-edge process nodes and 2.5D CoWoS® packaging technologies. Broadcom's proprietary design flow and automation methodology, built upon industry-standard tools, has ensured first-pass success despite the chip’s immense complexity. The 3.5D XDSiP has demonstrated complete functionality and exceptional performance across critical IP blocks, including high-speed SerDes, HBM memory interfaces, and die-to-die interconnects. This accomplishment underscores Broadcom's expertise in designing and testing complex 3.5D integrated circuits. “Advanced packaging is critical for next generation XPU clusters as we hit the limits of Moore’s Law. In close collaboration with our customers, we have created a 3.5D XDSiP platform on top of the technology and tools from TSMC and EDA partners,” said Frank Ostojic, Senior Vice President and General Manager, ASIC Products Division, Broadcom. “By stacking chip components vertically, Broadcom's 3.5D platform enables chip designers to pair the right fabrication processes for each component while shrinking the interposer and package size, leading to significant improvements in performance, efficiency, and cost.” “TSMC and Broadcom have collaborated closely over the past several years to bring together TSMC’s most advanced logic processes and 3D chip stacking technologies with Broadcom’s design expertise,” said Dr. Kevin Zhang, Senior Vice President of Business Development & Global Sales and Deputy Co-COO, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. “We look forward to productizing this platform to unleash AI innovations and enable future growth.” “With over a decade-long partnership, Fujitsu and Broadcom have successfully brought multiple generations of high-performance computing ASICs to the market,” said Naoki Shinjo, SVP and Head of Advanced Technology Development, Fujitsu. “Broadcom’s latest 3.5D platform enables Fujitsu’s next-generation 2-nanometer Arm-based processor, FUJITSU-MONAKA, to achieve high performance, low power consumption and lower cost.” With more than five 3.5D products in development, a majority of Broadcom’s consumer AI customers have adopted the 3.5D XDSiP platform technology with production shipments starting February 2026.

Here's what investors need to know today. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is soaring 4% to trade over $102,000 after President-elect Donald Trump nominated pro-crypto Paul Atkins to lead the SEC. The surge comes after the cryptocurrency had come close to breaching $100,000 in November in a post-election rally, but later fell as low as $91,000 as investors took profits. The news also boosted other crypto-related assets and companies, with MicroStrategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) all trading at least 5% higher in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are flat after each of the major indexes hit record intraday and closing highs Wednesday. Stocks are off to a strong start this month on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement pro-growth policies. Market watchers are also eyeing the release of more corporate earnings Thursday, including from Kroger (KR) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and digesting remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Crude futures, gold futures, and 10-year Treasury yields are little changed. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) is in talks with Nvidia (NVDA) to produce the latter's Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips at the contract manufacturer's plant in Arizona, Reuters reported. TSMC is preparing to start producing the AI chips early next year, the report said, but would still have to ship them to Taiwan for packaging. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of TSMC and shares of Nvidia are ticking higher in premarket trading. Five Below (FIVE) stock is soaring 14% in premarket trading, a day after the discount retailer appointed Forever 21's Winnie Park as its new CEO, effective Dec. 16, and raised its outlook for the year, noting "solid" Black Friday sales. Net sales for the year now are seen between $3.84 billion and $3.87 billion, up from $3.73 billion to $3.80 billion previously, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is expected between $4.78 and $4.96, raised from the prior range of $4.35 to $4.71. Third-quarter results also beat estimates. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are slumping 13% in premarket trading, a day after the clothing retailer's third-quarter results and fourth-quarter outlook came in below analysts' expectations. AEO reported a year-over-year revenue decline to $1.29 billion and profit that fell nearly 20% to $80 million. For the holiday quarter, AEO sees revenue down 4%, below estimates, which includes "a roughly $85 million impact from the combination of the retail calendar shift and one less selling week." JPMorgan subsequently downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight."

December 05, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. SAN DIEGO, Dec. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: KTOS), a Technology Company in the Defense, National Security and Global Markets and an industry-leading provider of high-performance, jet-powered unmanned aerial systems, today announced the successful performance of a recent series of flight tests of the United States Marine Corps’ XQ-58A Valkyrie, manufactured by Kratos. These flights and exercises were conducted jointly earlier this year by Kratos, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Autodyne, the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the United States Navy, and the United States Air Force (USAF). Kratos’ XQ-58A Flies in Joint Emerald Flag Exercise A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/94bd48b4-0b84-4660-8063-18330361338a The test was conducted as a part of Emerald Flag 2024—a multiservice and multi-domain training exercise. During this milestone event, the USMC demonstrated cooperative kill chain closure between crewed and uncrewed strike platforms, specifically Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie, for the first time in a large-force exercise. The USMC kill chain closure demonstration, hosted in a joint force environment, showcased collaborative electronic warfare (EW) operations in addition to newly added tactical data link capabilities. These tests mark the first time the Department of Defense (DoD) controlled an XQ-58 using expeditionary methods. Initial results indicate the system met threshold requirements for autonomously exchanging relevant tactical information. These capabilities significantly enhance the Marine Air-Ground Task Force’s ability to conduct integrated and joint operations, contributing to the USMC’s mission to deter conflict and, when necessary, defeat enemies in complex and evolving scenarios. These flights were conducted in partnership with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) AIRWorks, and industry partners. Flight test support was provided by the 40th Flight Test Squadron, the 46th Test Squadron, the 96th Test Wing, and the Marine Operational Test & Evaluation Squadron 1 (VMX-1). The latest event was witnessed by the USMC Deputy Commandant of Aviation, Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering, as well as officers and civilians from the Marine Corps Cunningham Group, Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Expeditionary and Maritime Aviation-Advanced Development Team (XMA-ADT), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). As the USMC advances towards the operational fielding of a new uncrewed system, Kratos is at the vanguard of technological advancement to ensure the Marines have the best tactical asset to complement their fleet of F-35B aircraft. Flying alongside four USMC F-35B aircraft from the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 214 (VMFA-214) and two USAF F-15E/EX aircraft from the 40th Flight Test Squadron, the USMC XQ-58A operated under vehicle-level autonomy to perform maneuvers in a simulated threat environment. The Valkyrie’s on-board sensors identified and geolocated relevant threats, and simultaneously passed targeting data to collaborating air and ground platforms over tactical networks. During the exercise, the XQ-58A was also flown by a USMC aviator, and control was passed between air and ground control methods which can command multiple Valkyries simultaneously. This demonstration of the XQ-58A’s ability to support crewed-uncrewed teaming and Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) marks a significant milestone in the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Unmanned Aerial System Expeditionary (MUX) Tactical Aircraft (TACAIR) development. Steve Fendley, President of Kratos Unmanned Systems Division, said, “We're proud to be leading the industry effort to demonstrate and deliver this critical collaborative uncrewed aircraft capability. The mission capability demonstrated during the latest exercise – enabling Marine Corps pilots to lead a strike package of multiple Valkyries seamlessly transferring C2 between crewed aircraft and expeditionary ground control stations, to autonomously accomplish the mission while reducing risk exposure – will be a force multiplier. Our integrated, autonomous collaborative platform, jet-powered aircraft systems truly validate the DoD's goal of achieving effective, survivable, affordable mass.” Flying since 2019, the Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie is a high-performance, runway-flexible tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of long-range flights at high-subsonic speeds. The Valkyrie can serve as a loyal wingman, conduct single unmanned aircraft system operations, or operate in swarms. Combining affordability, survivability, long-range, high-subsonic speeds, maneuverability, and ability to carry flexible mission kit configurations and mix of lethal weapons from its internal weapons bay and wing stations, the XQ-58A provides unmatched operational flexibility at an affordable price for multiple DoD customers.

Title: Why Time Horizon Matters: The Key To Successful Venture Capital Investing

Eric Satz is the Founder and CEO of Alto Solutions, which provides investment access to alternative assets for all. While it can be a challenge to stay the course, successful long-term investors understand that success depends on ignoring the daily noise and instead focusing on the long-term potential of your portfolio. The venture capital (VC) industry thrives off this mentality. Whether you are interested in investing some of your money in venture capital or simply would like to learn more about what goes through the minds of fund managers, here’s why a long-term time horizon is the key to successful VC investing. Venture capital, by design, is meant for long-term investing. The most successful venture capital firms usually raise money from institutional investors, including insurance companies, pension funds, university endowments and high-net-worth individuals. These investors make long-term, largely illiquid commitments and agree to leave their money with the VC fund for years. VC funds then invest in early-stage startup companies, hoping to find the next Apple, Google or Facebook. These companies need time to develop their products and build a customer base. They aren’t profitable overnight. Startups are private companies, which means they are not publicly traded on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. As a result, private company investors like VCs can’t just unilaterally decide to liquidate their investments the way one can if you hold public stocks in a brokerage account. Instead, VC funds, with few exceptions to the rule, must wait until the company is either acquired by another company or completes an initial public offering (IPO), where it offers its stock to public investors on an exchange. Typically, a private company investor must assume an investment time horizon of up to 12 years to achieve liquidity. VC funds must be patient investors and can be richly rewarded in exchange. Amazon is a classic example. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in 1994, running the company initially out of a garage. He first raised money from family and friends who contributed $50,000 each for 1% of the company. He then raised another $8 million from the VC firm Kleiner Perkins. At the time, Amazon seemed like a fascinating idea, but it was years away from turning a profit as a company and an investment. The company came dangerously close to going bankrupt and losing everything when the tech bubble crashed in early 2000. People would not have blamed the early investors for jumping ship as the tech sector seemed ready to crash and burn. However, the early investors who held on did unbelievably well. Kleiner Perkins turned that initial $8 million into $60 million when Amazon had its IPO, a generous return after a few years. And for those early investors who held on until today? They turned their $50,000 into billions. VC funds focus on startups developing new and disruptive technologies and solutions designed to transform entire industries. For example, Amazon took on in-person retail, Airbnb created an alternative to hotels, and Uber launched a more convenient taxi service. There’s risk involved, and most startups fail. But the ones that succeed have the potential for massive returns—far higher than what you should expect to make in the stock market. Naturally, going after massive, established industries takes time. Consumer behavior does not change overnight. If VC firms focused on short-term returns and performance metrics like profits, they would cash out early and miss the really big opportunities. Apple under Steve Jobs is one of the country’s most famous success stories, but there were major bumps along the way. After a promising launch, Apple’s board of directors and investors forced Steve Jobs out in 1985. They thought the company needed a more traditional CEO to refine the company and generate steadier sales and profits. The plan backfired badly. Apple lost market share and prestige to competitors like IBM and Microsoft. In 1997, Apple brought Steve Jobs back, and he reinvigorated the market with new product launches like the iPod, iPhone and iMac. Once Apple focused on long-term innovation over short-term profits, it regained its status as a premier company. Investors were also richly rewarded. Apple shares shot up from around $0.10 in 1997 to over $200 today, which shows why VC investors have far more upside by focusing on the long term. Exciting new ideas continue to bubble under the economy’s surface. AI, blockchain and renewable energy are a few that could completely transform the world today. But like other past developments, they still need time. VC investors who focus on the long term are the ones who will reap the rewards. As a personal investor, keep these lessons in mind. By focusing on the long term, exercising conviction and remaining patient, you can succeed too.

By Wen-Yee Lee and Fanny Potkin TAIPEI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said. TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said. Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year. TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential. Two of the sources said Apple and Advanced Micro Devices are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said. All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. Some investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech’s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined Yahoo Finance to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024. Ma believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025. He added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector. 2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic’s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2. Databricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris. To come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Street High Upside as of December 3, 2024: 42% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a semiconductor company that ranks sixth on our list of AI stocks that are expected to skyrocket. The company is one of the largest suppliers of microprocessor technology, graphics and camera technology, and physical IP and processor implementation solutions. Since 1990, the company has shipped more than 300 billion chips, positioning it as a leader in the industry. On the AI front, the company is making significant advances. In the fiscal second quarter of 2025, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) partnered with Meta to optimize Llama and other models for generative artificial intelligence from the data center to edge devices. On October 23, the company announced a collaboration with MediaTek and Vivo to help enhance AI experiences on smartphones. In addition to that, the incidence of AI is significantly increasing the demand for ARM’s energy-efficient compute platform. Overall, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) holds dominance in the AI market, especially for mobile, cloud compute, automotive, and IoT use cases. Some of its leading partners in the AI industry include SoundHound AI, Weetaq, Embedl, ENERZAi, and Doulos, to name a few. Analysts are also favoring the stock and their high price target of 200 represents an upside of 42% from current levels. Overall, ARM ranks 6th on our list of AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Our expert games writer predicts the gaming trends for 2025, including Nintendo Switch 2, the rise of indie gaming, the impact of generative AI and how Unreal Engine 5 will shake things up . When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Predicting the gaming trends for 2025 starts with reflecting on what's happened in 2024. After another tumultuous year of layoffs and studio closures, many folks in the games industry will be staggering into 2025 with an understandable sense of anxiety. As while Epic Games has had a good year with Unreal Engine 5 and Nintendo continues to buck the trends, many studios have suffered. But there are some potential bright spots ahead. The launch of Nintendo Switch 2 (read our Switch 2 rumours feature for the latest info), the follow-up to the almighty Switch handheld, is sure to buoy the industry, as will the juggernaut that is GTA 6, even if it swallows attention from other titles like a black hole sucking in light. Yet there’s still that lingering sense of unease. Can new live-service games succeed in the market, given the disaster of Concord? Will generative AI improve games, or make things worse? Will Microsoft's Game Pass succeed, or are subscription services on the way out? In the midst of all this uncertainty, it’s perhaps comforting that games with relatively simple, old-school design are cutting through, like the excellent Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 and Still Wakes The Deep, indicating that bigger, more beautiful and more complicated worlds aren’t necessarily better, or even what players particularly want. The rise of 'AAA-lite' games, advances in AI for indie development, more cross-platform and cross-media games, as well perhaps a relaunch of classic IP as publishers play on nostalgia in the wake of Silent Hill 2: Remake's success, could all point to a better, more balanced year for games and indies. In light of all that, here are ten gaming trends and predictions to look out for in 2025. These include new launches, advances in tech, new ways of working and more. Anticipation is mounting for the follow-up to Nintendo’s mega-hit Switch console, which has sold more than 146 million units since its release in March 2017. Nintendo has said that an announcement on Switch 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will be made by the end of March 2025 at the latest, and we already know it will be backwards compatible with the Switch. Will Nintendo play it safe by essentially making another Switch with beefier specs and a better screen? Or will Nintendo follow past precedent by introducing some kind of new hardware gimmick? My money’s on some kind of dual-screen setup, toying with our love and nostalgia for Nintendo DS, but Nintendo does like to surprise us. Remember that alarm clock? We curate the best offers on creative kit and give our expert recommendations to save you time this Black Friday. Upgrade your setup for less with Creative Bloq. What seems almost certain is that we’ll get a new 3D Mario, probably as a launch title, since it’s been seven whole years since the last one, Super Mario Odyssey. And if we’re lucky, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond might make its long-awaited debut alongside the new console, ever since being teased at a Nintendo Direct earlier this year. Sony's live service shooter Concord was the biggest video-game flop of 2024, shut down just two weeks after its launch in August as a result of catastrophically low player counts. Sony later shuttered the game’s creator, Firewalk Studios, having only bought the studio in 2023. Earlier in the year, Warner Bros.’ Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League made a similarly disappointing debut, showing that even licensed properties can struggle in vain to attract players away from well-established live-service titles such as Fortnite and GTAV. These high-profile failures are likely to make big publishers think twice about launching new live-service titles in 2025. At Sony, as reported in sister site Games Radar, The Last of Us Online has already been cancelled, but reportedly there’s still a Horizon MMO in the works: it remains to be seen whether it will live to see the light of day, given the Concord debacle. Sony also has at least two other live-service games lined up, currently without a firm release date: Marathon from Bungie, developer of Destiny 2 (read our deep dive into making the The Final Shape expansion), and Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s Haven Studios. Will they release in 2025? And can they fare any better? Concord has shown how difficult it is to launch new IP in the live-service space, but one game could potentially buck the trend: early feedback on Valve’s Deadlock has been positive from sister games site PCGamer, and there’s every chance it could burst out of beta in 2025. Microsoft reportedly had some lengthy internal debates (according to The Verge) about whether to put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. Since the purchase of Activision Blizzard, Call of Duty has become Microsoft’s jewel in the crown, but shoving the new CoD game onto Microsoft’s subscription service would naturally mean sacrificing some hefty day-one sales on Xbox. The fact that it happened shows Microsoft is committed to making Game Pass succeed. Circana reported that Game Pass subscriptions surged on the release of Black Ops 6, but the big question is whether these new subscribers will stick around for the long haul. Expect to see older Call of Duty games being drip fed onto Game Pass over the next 12 months to keep these new subscribers interested. Microsoft has a lot coming to, and on, Game Pass, including the new Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle blockbuster, Stalker 2 and in 2025 Avowed from respected RPG team Obsidian Entertainment is come to the service, alongside Fable, DOOM: The Dark Ages and Gears of War E-Day. At the same time, Microsoft is pushing Game Pass onto as many devices as possible, including Samsung TVs and Amazon Fire Stick, backed by the confusing ‘This is an Xbox’ ad campaign. There's a clear strategy to move beyond hardware and release games across platforms, something other publishers are also looking into, including Sony with its PlayStation Plus subscription. But if subscriber numbers falter in 2025, this could signal the end of the Game Pass experiment: if Call of Duty can’t make subscribers stick around, then surely nothing can. The past two years have seen the release of a plethora of big-hitter VR and AR devices, including PSVR2, Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 (all featured in our best VR headsets roundup). But 2025 seems to be a bit quieter on the new hardware front. "We're unlikely to see Apple's next headset this year, though reports on the specific timeline are conflicted," says Henry Stockdale, staff writer at UploadVR. "Samsung's upcoming Android XR headset is also on the way, but that's reportedly been delayed,” he adds, meaning we’re increasingly unlikely to see it in 2025. But there’s an outside chance that Valve might spring a surprise. “We've recently seen controller models emerge on SteamVR for the rumoured Valve Deckard,” Henry says, referring to Valve’s long-in-gestation follow up to its Index VR headset from 2019. “Knowing Valve though, whether that's actually coming soon is anyone's guess.” Although Apple Vision Pro 2 might be a long way off, there’s a chance we could see a cheaper version of the Apple Vision headset by the end of the year, which could give Meta a headache, unless Quest 4 is incoming. The idea of creating generative-AI powered non-player characters (NPCs) has captivated some, who see it as a way to generate realistic, expansive conversations in place of characters that default to the same repeating phrases. Others, meanwhile, like Inkle’s Jon Ingold, merely regard it as a way of “creating an unworkable design purely to employ AI”. Whatever your viewpoint, we will start to see generative-AI powered NPCs emerge in 2025, such as the antagonist of Meaning Machine’s Dead Meat, a game that sees you posing questions to a large language model-powered suspect in an attempt to extract a murder confession. We might also start to see the first NPCs made using Nvidia ACE, which is now available as a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. We've already got to test Nvidia's character AI for games and it's actually remarkable, but also fallible and has revealed good writers will be in demand even with gen AI characters. Other major developers are experimenting with gen AI for game design and NPCs, ahead of them all seems to be Ubisoft, that could have a game out in 2025 which makes use of Nvidia Audio2Face AI, to create its own NEO NPC, as well as other AI apps. Read 'How Ubisoft’s New generative AI prototype changes the narrative for NPCs' for an insight. Since its release in 2013, GTA V has sold well over 200 million copies, and the launch of GTA 6 is set to upend all sales records, such is the demand for a sequel. Indeed, the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in 2025 was so momentous that it broke through the navel-gazing world of video games and into the world at large, making headlines on the BBC and other mainstream news channels. Accordingly, although GTA 6 is likely to lift the overall revenue of the games industry, its debut will be devastating for any games released in its wake. "No one will play anything else for six months after it," says Mike Rose, head of indie publisher No More Robots. "In the weeks, months after GTA 6 comes out, some people will never buy a game ever again. They'll play this game, and that will be it: it will become their Roblox." Sam Barlow, founder of Immortality maker Half Mermaid Productions, has noted the trend for more ambitious, open-world indie games like Sable and Tchia over the past few years, with “people stepping out of the assumptions around pixel art and two-dimensional things into more full-bodied 3D experiences”. He thinks this trend will continue in 2025, with indie developers using engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity 6 to streamline many processes and create bigger worlds rather than making the prettiest games possible. "The cool thing with indies is, if you have more powerful machines and engines, it's not about maxing them out, it's just you can make things quicker". Indie auteur Sam Barlow isn't the first developer to say this, when we spoke with Anna Hollinrake about making her first game as an indie dev, the colourful open-world narrative game Crescent County, she revealed the move to Unreal Engine 5 made the larger world design, for a small team, possible. "We actually ended up making it too big," she told us. The EU Digital Markets Act has paved the way for rival app stores to come to iOS, and the Epic Game Store has already launched on Apple devices. “Unfortunately very few people seem to have noticed,” says Neil Long, founder of MobileGamer.biz, “and I’m not all that confident that even the promise of regular free games, like Epic offers through its PC store, will help.” Neil thinks that the monster hit Fortnite isn’t enough to tempt most people away from Apple’s own App Store, or Google’s equivalent. “Epic needs more killer content to get people to use its stores and make it clear why people should bother when the default iOS and Android stores do a solid job,” he says. Microsoft is also likely to launch its own app store in 2025. But Neil points out that the Redmond giant’s mobile strategy has been “all over the place”, so he isn’t confident that either Epic or Microsoft can attract sufficient customer numbers, “even though the market desperately needs new contenders to rein in Apple and Google, who are utterly dominant.” We've seen Apple itself push new mobile hardware to gamers, including seeing more Triple-A game releases on iPad, such Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 for iPhone. The mobile space is set to grow and become more important in 2025, and we've already seen both Unity and Unreal Engine 5.5 promote new tools for development on mobile platforms. There's a convergence happening with technology, as Unreal Engine and Unity become as useful outside of game development as within. We've seen in the past how Unreal us used to create immersive live experiences, such as Frameless in London that puts you into classic works of art and its use in filmmaking to drive LED Volume stages, the kind used by ILM for Star Wars. Just this month Felix & Paul Studios has announced a new 20,000-Square-Foot 'Interstellar Arc' mixed reality experience that will launch in Las Vegas in 2025 to rival the Las Vegas Sphere for tech and spectacle. This could lead to more virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality events launching in 2025, particularly as publishers look to leverage brands in new ways. Already an early contender to take your money, at least in the UK, is the upcoming Pac-Man Live experience that uses similar immersive tech as an Unreal Volume to out players into the Pac-Man maze as they're chased by augmented reality ghosts. Expect more immersive events in 2025 as gaming and game design evolves from the screen and into real life in new ways, especially with advances in AI like the Move AI's mocap 'Live' system that can capture movement and put it into scenes on a screen in real time. Sam Barlow notes that some of the biggest hits of the past year have relied on tried and tested design elements. “I mean, Metaphor: ReFantazio is pretty much literally a PS2 game in the way it’s set up,” he says, calling it “an extremely archaic RPG design” that is “extremely confident and polished in what it's doing”. He gives Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl as another example. “They're not even necessarily embracing a lot of the technical progress that's been made,” he says of the game that has dominated his recent playing time. “Stalker 2 is a 2000s PC game: it doesn't have cool, emergent physics, all the stuff that Zelda: Breath of the Wild did to innovate open world. It's not doing any of that. It's them going, ‘What if we made a 2000s PC game, but we can do 100 times as many trees?’.” Similarly, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which shot past 4.5 million sales in a month is an old-fashioned Xbox 360-style shooter that simply refines classic ideas and reworks them for new players. Its success, and that of other old-school new releases, shows that players seem happy to embrace simpler game design, perhaps even as a form of nostalgia. It’s likely other studios will take note and follow suit in 2025. The wake of team downsizing and studio closures, and soaring development costs, combined with 'smaller' games performing well in 2024, a big game design trend for 2025 will see the return of well-made, polished, smaller-scale games made on sustainable budgets with a blend of AAA ambition and indie sensibilities. Likewise, publishers will look at the buzz around brand revivals like Silent Hill 2, Dragon Quest III HD-2D and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and want to replicate those successes. We already have Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD and The Thing Remastered from remaster specials Nightdive Studios, so expect something special from Sony in particular. While it's clear Nintendo Switch 2, generative AI, new tools for Unreal Engine 5, the rise of indies and more will happen in 2025, there are some outside chances of other things happening in video games.

Title: Godot Isn't Making it

Time Published: 2024-12-05T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Before we get going — please enjoy my speech from Web Summit, Why Are All Tech Products Now Shit? I didn’t write the title. I have been warning you for the best part of a year that generative AI has no killer apps and had no way of justifying its valuations (February), that generative AI had already peaked (March), and I have pleaded with people to consider an eventuality where the jump from GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not significant, in part due to a lack of training data (April). I shared concerns in July that the transformer-based-architecture underpinning generative AI was a dead end, and that there were few ways we'd progress past the products we'd already seen, in part due to both the limits of training data and the limits of models that use said training data. In August, I summarized the Pale Horses of the AI Apocalypse — events, many that have since come to pass, that would signify that the end is indeed nigh — and again added that GPT-5 would likely "not change the game enough to matter, let alone [add] a new architecture to build future (and more capable) models on." Throughout these pieces I have repeatedly made the point that — separate to any lack of a core value proposition, training data drought, or unsustainable economics — generative AI is a dead end due to the limitations of probabilistic models that hallucinate, where they authoritatively state things that aren't true. The hallucination problem is one that is nowhere closer to being solved — and, at least with the current technology — may never go away, and it makes it a non-starter for a great many business tasks, where you need a high level of reliability. I have — since March — expressed great dismay about the credulousness of the media in their acceptance of the "inevitable" ways in which generative AI will change society, despite a lack of any truly meaningful product that might justify an environmentally-destructive industry led by a company that burns more than $5 billion a year and big tech firms spending $200 billion on data centers for products that people don't want. The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long. And you're going to need context for everything I'm about to throw at you. A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are struggling to build more advanced AI, and that OpenAI's "Orion" model — otherwise known as GPT-5 — "did not hit the company's desired performance," and that "Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up" as it was from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, its current model. You'll be shocked to hear the reason is that because "it’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems," something I said would happen in March, while also adding that the "AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," something I said more forcefully in July. I also want to stop and stare daggers at one particular point: The only people taking this as "gospel" have been members of the media unwilling to ask the tough questions and AI founders that don't know what the fuck they're talking about (or that intend to mislead). Generative AI's products have effectively been trapped in amber for over a year. There have been no meaningful, industry-defining products, because, as economist Daron Acemoglu said back in May, "more powerful" models do not unlock new features, or really change the experience, nor what you can build with transformer-based models. Or, put another way, a slightly better white elephant is still a white elephant. Despite the billions of dollars burned and thousands of glossy headlines, it's difficult to point to any truly important generative-AI-powered product. Even Apple Intelligence, the only thing that Apple really had to add to the latest iPhone, is utterly dull, and largely based on on-device models. Yes, there are people that use ChatGPT — 200 million of them a week, allegedly, losing the company money with every prompt — but there is little to suggest that there's widespread adoption of actual generative AI software. The Information reported in September that between 0.1% and 1% of the 440 million of Microsoft's business customers were paying for its AI-powered Copilot, and in late October, Microsoft claimed that "AI is on pace to be a $10 billion-a-year business," which sounds good until you consider a few things: I must be clear that every single one of these investments and products has been hyped with the whisper that they would get exponentially better over time, and that eventually the $200 billion in capital expenditures would spit out remarkable productivity improvements and fascinating new products that consumers and enterprises would buy in droves. Instead, big tech has found itself peddling increasingly-more-expensive iterations of near-identical Large Language Models — a direct result of them all having to use the same training data, which it’s now running out of. The other assumption — those so-called scaling laws — has been that by simply building bigger data centers with more GPUs (the expensive, power-hungry graphics processing units used to both run and train these models) and throwing as much training data at them as possible, they'd simply start sprouting new capabilities, despite there being little proof that they'd do so. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all burned billions on the assumption that doing so would create something — be it a human-level "artificial general intelligence" or, I dunno, a product that would justify the costs — and it's become painfully obvious that it isn't going to work. As we speak, outlets are already desperate to try and prove that this isn't a problem. The Information, in a similar story to Bloomberg's, attempted to put lipstick on the pig of generative AI, framing the lack of meaningful progress with GPT-5 as fine, because OpenAI can combine its GPT-5 Model with its o-1 "reasoning" model, which will then do something of some sort, such as "write a lot more very difficult code" according to OpenAI CEO and career liar Sam Altman, who intimated that GPT-5 may function like a "virtual brain" in May. Chief Valley Cheerleader Casey Newton wrote on Platformer last week that diminishing returns in training models "may not matter as much as you would guess," with his evidence being that Anthropic, who he claims "has not been prone to hyperbole," do not think that scaling laws are ending. To be clear, in a 14,000 op-ed that Newton wrote two pieces about, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that "AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure, most mental illness," the kind of hyperbole that should have you tarred and feathered in public. So, let me summarize: The entire tech industry has become oriented around a dead-end technology that requires burning billions of dollars to provide inessential products that cost them more money to serve than anybody would ever pay. Their big strategy was to throw even more money at the problem until one of these transformer-based models created a new, more useful product — despite the fact that every iteration of GPT and other models has been, well, iterative. There has never been any proof (other than benchmarks that are increasingly easier to game) that GPT or other models would become conscious, nor that these models would do more than they do today, or three months ago, or even a year ago. Yet things can, believe it or not, get worse. The AI boom helped the S&P 500 hit record high levels in 2024, largely thanks to chip giant NVIDIA, a company that makes both the GPUs necessary to train and run generative AI models and the software architecture behind them. Part of NVIDIA's remarkable growth has been its ability to capitalize on the CUDA architecture — the software layer that lets you do complex computing with GPUs, rather than simply use them to render video games in increasingly higher resolution — and, of course, continually create new GPUs to sell for tens of thousands of dollars to tech companies that want to burn billions of dollars on generative AI, leading the company's stock to pop more than 179% over the last year. Back in May, NVIDIA CEO and professional carnival barker Jensen Huang said that the company was now "on a one-year rhythm" in AI GPU production, with its latest "Blackwell" GPUs (specifically the B100, B200 and GB200 models used for generative AI) supposedly due at the end of 2024, but are now delayed until at least March 2025.Before we go any further, it's worth noting that when I say "GPU," I don't mean the one you'd find in a gaming PC, but a much larger chip put in a specialized server with multiple other GPUs, all integrated with specialized casing, cooling, and networking infrastructure. In simple terms, the things necessary to make sure all these chips work together efficiently, and also stop them from overheating, because they get extremely hot and are running at full speed, all the time. The initial delay of the new Blackwell chips was caused by a (now-fixed) design flaw in production, but as I've suggested above, the problem isn't just creating the chips — it's making sure they actually work, at scale, for the jobs they're bought for. But what if that, too, wasn't possible? A few days ago, The Information reported that NVIDIA is grappling with the oldest problem in computing — how to cool the fucking things. According to the report, NVIDIA has been asking suppliers to change the design of its 3,000-pound, 75-GPU server racks "several times" to overcome overheating problems, which The Information calls "the most complicated design NVIDIA had ever come up with." According to the report, a few months after revealing the racks, engineers found that they...didn't work properly, even with Nvidia’s smaller 36-chip racks, and have been scrambling to fix it ever since. While one can dazzle investors with buzzwords and charts, the laws of physics are a far harsher mistress, and if NVIDIA is struggling mere months before the first installations are to begin, it's unclear how it practically launches this generation of chips, let alone continues its yearly cadence. The Information reports that these changes have been made late in the production process, which is scaring customers that desperately need them so that their models can continue to do something they'll work out later. To quote The Information: The fact that NVIDIA is having such significant difficulties with thermal performance is very, very bad. These chips are incredibly expensive — as much as $70,000 a piece — and will be running, as I've mentioned, at full speed, generating an incredible amount of heat that must be dissipated, while sat next to anywhere from 35 to 71 other chips, which will in turn be densely packed so that you can cram more servers into a data center. New, more powerful chips require entirely new methods to rack-mount, operate and cool them, and all of these parts must operate in sync, as overheating GPUs will die. While these units are big, some of their internal components are microscopic in size, and unless properly cooled, their circuits will start to crumble when roasted by a guy typing "Garfield with Gun" into ChatGPT. Remember, Blackwell is supposed to represent a major leap forward in performance. If NVIDIA doesn’t solve its cooling problem — and solve it well — its customers will undoubtedly encounter thermal throttling, where the chip reduces speed in order to avoid causing permanent damage. It could eliminate any performance gains obtained from the new architecture and new manufacturing process, despite costing much, much more than its predecessor. NVIDIA's problem isn't just bringing these thermal performance issues under control, but both keeping them under control and being able to educate their customers on how to do so. NVIDIA has, according to The Information, repeatedly tried to influence its customers' server integrations to follow its designs because it thinks it will "lead to better performance," but in this case, one has to worry if NVIDIA's Blackwell chips can be reliably cooled. While NVIDIA might be able to fix this problem in isolation within its racks, it remains to be seen how this works at scale as they ship and integrate hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs starting in the front half of 2025. Things also get a little worse when you realize how these chips are being installed — in giant “supercomputer” data centers where tens of thousands, or as many as a hundred thousand in the case of Elon Musk’s “colossus” data center — of GPUs run in concert to power generative AI models. The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that building these vast data centers creates entirely new engineering challenges, with one expert saying that big tech companies could be using as much as half of their capital expenditures on replacing parts that have broken down, in large part because these clusters are running their GPUs at full speed, at all times. Remember, the capital expenditures on generative AI and the associated infrastructure have gone over $200 billion in the last year. If half of that’s dedicated to replacing broken gear, what happens when there’s no path to profitability? In any case, NVIDIA doesn’t care. It’s already made billions of dollars selling Blackwell GPUs — they're sold out for a year, after all — and will continue to do so for now, but any manufacturing or cooling issues will likely be costly. And even then, at some point somebody has to ask the question: why do we need all these GPUs if we've reached peak AI? Despite the remarkable "power" of these chips, NVIDIA's entire enterprise GPU business model centers around the idea that throwing more power at these problems will finally create some solutions. What if that isn't the case? The tech industry is over-leveraged, having doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on generative AI — a technology that doesn't do much more than it did a few months ago and won't do much more than it can do now. Every single big tech company has piled tens of billions of dollars into building out massive data centers with the intent of "capturing AI demand," yet never seemed to think whether they were actually building things that people wanted, or would pay for, or would somehow make the company money. While some have claimed that "agents are the next frontier," the reality is that agents may be the last generative AI product — multiple Large Language Models and integrations bouncing off of each other in an attempt to simulate what a human might do at a cost that won't be sustainable for the majority of businesses. While Anthropic's demo of its model allegedly controlling a few browser windows with a prompt might have seemed impressive to credulous people like Casey Newton, these were controlled demos which Anthropic added were "slow" and "made lots of mistakes." Hey, almost like it's hallucinating! I sure hope they fix that totally unfixable problem. Even if it does, Anthropic has now successfully replaced...an entry-level data worker position at an indeterminate and likely unprofitable price. And in many organizations, those jobs had already been outsourced, or automated, or staffed with cheaper contractors. The obscenity of this mass delusion is nauseating — a monolith to bad decision-making and the herd mentality of tech's most powerful people, as well as an outright attempt to manipulate the media into believing something was possible that wasn't. And the media bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted building giant data centers to crunch numbers for software that has no real product-market fit, all while trying to hammer it into various shapes to make it pretend that it's alive, conscious, or even a useful product. There is no path, from what I can see, to turn generative AI and its associated products into anything resembling sustainable businesses, and the only path that big tech appeared to have was to throw as much money, power, and data at the problem as possible, an avenue that appears to be another dead end. And worse still, nothing has really come out of this movement. I've used a handful of AI products that I've found useful — an AI powered journal, for example — but these are not the products that one associates with "revolutions," but useful tools that would have been a welcome surprise if they didn't require burning billions of dollars, blowing past emissions targets and stealing the creative works of millions of people to train them. I truly don't know what happens next, but I'll walk you through what I'm thinking. If we're truly at the diminishing returns stage of transformer-based models, it will be extremely difficult to justify buying further iterations of NVIDIA GPUs past Blackwell. The entire generative AI movement lives and dies by the idea that more compute power and more training data makes these things better, and if that's no longer the case, there's little reason to keep buying bigger and better. After all, what's the point? Even now, what exactly happens when Microsoft or Google has racks-worth of Blackwell GPUs? The models aren't going to get better. This also makes the lives of OpenAI and Anthropic that much more difficult. Sam Altman has grown rich and powerful lying about how GPT will somehow lead to AGI, but at this point, what exactly is OpenAI meant to do? The only way it’s ever been able to develop new models is by throwing masses of compute and training data at the problem, and its only other choice is to start stapling its reasoning model onto its main Large Language Model, at which point something happens, something so good that literally nobody working for OpenAI or in the media appears to be able to tell you what it is. Putting that aside, OpenAI is also a terrible business that has to burn $5 billion to make $3.4 billion, with no proof that it’s capable of bringing down costs. The constant refrain I hear from VCs and AI fantasists is that "chips will bring down the cost of inference," yet I don't see any proof of that happening, nor do I think it'll happen quickly enough for these companies to turn things around. And you can feel the desperation, too. OpenAI is reportedly looking at ads as a means to narrow the gap between its revenues and losses. As I pointed out in Burst Damage, introducing an advertising revenue stream would require significant upfront investment, both in terms of technology and talent. OpenAI would need a way to target ads, and a team to sell advertising — or, instead, use a third-party ad network that would take a significant bite out of its revenue. It’s unclear how much OpenAI could charge advertisers, or what percentage of its reported 200 million weekly users have an ad-blocker installed. Or, for that matter, whether ads would provide a perverse incentive for OpenAI to enshittify an already unreliable product. Facebook and Google — as I’ve previously noted — have made their products manifestly worse in order to increase the amount of time people spend on their sites, and thus, the number of ads they see. In the case of Facebook, it buried your newsfeed under a deluge of AI-generated sludge and “recommended content.” Google, meanwhile, has progressively degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase the volume of queries it received as a means of making sure users saw more ads. OpenAI could, just as easily, fall into the same temptation. Most people who use ChatGPT are trying to accomplish a specific task — like writing a term paper, or researching a topic, or whatever — and then they leave. And so, the amount of ads they’d conceivably see each will undoubtedly be comparatively low compared to a social network or search engine. Would OpenAI try to get users to stick around longer — to write more prompts — by crippling the performance of its models? Even if OpenAI listens to its better angels, the reality still stands: ads won’t dam the rising tide of red ink that promises to eventually drown the company. This is a truly dismal situation where the only options are to stop now, or continue burning money until the heat gets too much. It cost $100 million to train GPT-4o, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated a few months ago that training future models will cost $1 billion to $10 billion, with one researcher claiming that training OpenAI's GPT-5 will cost around $1 billion. And that’s before mentioning any, to quote a Rumsfeldism, “unknown unknowns.” Trump’s election, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, changes everything and in ways we don’t yet fully understand. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has successfully ingratiated himself with Trump, thanks to his early and full-throated support of his campaign. He’s now reportedly living in Mar a Lago, sitting on calls with world leaders, and whispering in Trump’s ear as he builds his cabinet. And, as The Journal claims, his enemies fear that he could use his position of influence to harm them or their businesses — chiefly Sam Altman, who is “persona non grata” in Musk’s world, largely due to the new for-profit direction of OpenAI. While it’s likely that these companies will fail due to inevitable organic realities (like running out of money, or not having a product that generates a profit), Musk’s enemies must now contend with a new enemy — one with the full backing of the Federal government, and that neither forgives nor forgets. And, crucially, one that’s not afraid to bend ethical or moral laws to further his own interests — or to inflict pain on those perceived as having slighted him. Even if Musk doesn’t use his newfound political might to hurt Altman and OpenAI, he could still pursue the company as a private citizen. Last Friday, he filed an injunction requesting a halt to OpenAI’s transformation from an ostensible non-profit to a for-profit business. Even if he ultimately fails, should Musk manage to drag the process out, or delay it temporarily, it could strike a terminal blow for OpenAI. That’s because in its most recent fundraise, OpenAI agreed that it would convert its recent $6.6bn equity investment into high-interest debt, should it fail to successfully convert into a for-profit business within a two-year period. This was a tight deadline to begin with, and it can’t afford any delays. The interest payments on that debt would massively increase its cash burn, and it would undoubtedly find it hard to obtain further outside investment. Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling. It's unclear how much further this farce continues, if only because it isn't obvious what it is that anybody gets by investing in future rounds in OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other generative AI company. At some point they must make money, and the entire dream has been built around the idea that all of these GPUs and all of this money would eventually spit out something revolutionary. Yet what we have is clunky, ugly, messy, larcenous, environmentally-destructive and mediocre. Generative AI was a reckless pursuit, one that shows a total lack of creativity and sense in the minds of big tech and venture capital, one where there was never anything really impressive other than the amount of money it could burn and the amount of times Sam Altman could say something stupid and get quoted for it. I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what happens here. The future was always one that demanded that big tech spent more to make even bigger models that would at some point become useful, and that isn't happening. In pursuit of doing so, big tech invested hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure specifically to follow one goal, and put AI front and center at their businesses, claiming it was the future without ever considering what they'd do if it wasn't. The revenue isn't coming. The products aren't coming. "Orion," OpenAI's next model, will underwhelm, as will its competitors' models, and at some point somebody is going to blink in one of the hyperscalers, and the AI era will be over. Almost every single generative AI company that you’ve heard of is deeply unprofitable, and there are few innovations coming to save them from the atrophy of the foundation models. I feel sad and exhausted as I write this, drained as I look at the many times I’ve tried to warn people, frustrated at the many members of the media that failed to push back against the overpromises and outright lies of people like Sam Altman, and full of dread as I consider the economic ramifications of this industry collapsing. Once the AI bubble pops, there are no other hyper-growth markets left, which will in turn lead to a bloodbath in big tech stocks as they realize that they’re out of big ideas to convince the street that they’re going to grow forever. There are some that will boast about “being right” here, and yes, there is some satisfaction in being so. Nevertheless, knowing that the result of this bubble bursting will be massive layoffs, a dearth in venture capital funding, and a much more fragile tech ecosystem. I’ll end with a quote from Bubble Trouble, a piece I wrote in April: I was right then and I’m right now. Generative AI isn’t a revolution, it’s an evolution of a tech industry overtaken by growth-hungry management consultant types that neither know the problems that real people face nor how to fix them. It’s a sickening waste, a monument to the corrupting force of growth, and a sign that the people in power no longer work for you, the customer, but for the venture capitalists and the markets. I also want to be clear that none of these companies ever had a plan. They believed that if they threw enough GPUs together they would turn generative AI – probabilistic models for generating stuff — into some sort of sentient computer. It’s much easier, and more comfortable, to look at the world as a series of conspiracies and grand strategies, and far scarier to see it for what it is — extremely rich and powerful people that are willing to bet insanely large amounts of money on what amounts to a few PDFs and their gut. This is not big tech’s big plan to excuse building more data centers — it’s the death throes of twenty years of growth-at-all-costs thinking, because throwing a bunch of money at more servers and more engineers always seemed to create more growth. In practice, this means that the people in charge and the strategies they employ are borne not of an interest in improving the lives of their customers, but in increasing revenue growth, which means the products they create aren’t really about solving any problem other than “what will make somebody give me more money,” which doesn’t necessarily mean “provide them with a service.” Generative AI is the perfect monster of the Rot Economy — a technology that lacks any real purpose sold as if it could do literally anything, one without a real business model or killer app, proliferated because big tech no longer innovates, but rather clones and monopolizes. Yes, this much money can be this stupid, and yes, they will burn billions in pursuit of a non-specific dream that involves charging you money and trapping you in their ecosystem. I’m not trying to be a doomsayer, just like I wasn’t trying to be one in March. I believe all of this is going nowhere, and that at some point Google, Microsoft, or Meta is going to blink and pull back on their capital expenditures. And before then, you’re going to get a lot of desperate stories about how “AI gains can be found outside of training new models” to try and keep the party going, despite reality flicking the lights on and off and threatening to call the police. I fear for the future for many reasons, but I always have hope, because I believe that there are still good people in the tech industry and that customers are seeing the light. Bluesky feels different — growing rapidly, competing with both Threads and Twitter, all while selling an honest product and an open protocol. There are other ideas for the future that aren’t borne of the scuzzy mindset of billionaire shitheels like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, and they can — and will — grow out of the ruins created by these kleptocrats.

Full Content:
Before we get going — please enjoy my speech from Web Summit, Why Are All Tech Products Now Shit? I didn’t write the title. I have been warning you for the best part of a year that generative AI has no killer apps and had no way of justifying its valuations (February), that generative AI had already peaked (March), and I have pleaded with people to consider an eventuality where the jump from GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not significant, in part due to a lack of training data (April). I shared concerns in July that the transformer-based-architecture underpinning generative AI was a dead end, and that there were few ways we'd progress past the products we'd already seen, in part due to both the limits of training data and the limits of models that use said training data. In August, I summarized the Pale Horses of the AI Apocalypse — events, many that have since come to pass, that would signify that the end is indeed nigh — and again added that GPT-5 would likely "not change the game enough to matter, let alone [add] a new architecture to build future (and more capable) models on." Throughout these pieces I have repeatedly made the point that — separate to any lack of a core value proposition, training data drought, or unsustainable economics — generative AI is a dead end due to the limitations of probabilistic models that hallucinate, where they authoritatively state things that aren't true. The hallucination problem is one that is nowhere closer to being solved — and, at least with the current technology — may never go away, and it makes it a non-starter for a great many business tasks, where you need a high level of reliability. I have — since March — expressed great dismay about the credulousness of the media in their acceptance of the "inevitable" ways in which generative AI will change society, despite a lack of any truly meaningful product that might justify an environmentally-destructive industry led by a company that burns more than $5 billion a year and big tech firms spending $200 billion on data centers for products that people don't want. The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long. And you're going to need context for everything I'm about to throw at you. A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are struggling to build more advanced AI, and that OpenAI's "Orion" model — otherwise known as GPT-5 — "did not hit the company's desired performance," and that "Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up" as it was from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, its current model. You'll be shocked to hear the reason is that because "it’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems," something I said would happen in March, while also adding that the "AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," something I said more forcefully in July. I also want to stop and stare daggers at one particular point: The only people taking this as "gospel" have been members of the media unwilling to ask the tough questions and AI founders that don't know what the fuck they're talking about (or that intend to mislead). Generative AI's products have effectively been trapped in amber for over a year. There have been no meaningful, industry-defining products, because, as economist Daron Acemoglu said back in May, "more powerful" models do not unlock new features, or really change the experience, nor what you can build with transformer-based models. Or, put another way, a slightly better white elephant is still a white elephant. Despite the billions of dollars burned and thousands of glossy headlines, it's difficult to point to any truly important generative-AI-powered product. Even Apple Intelligence, the only thing that Apple really had to add to the latest iPhone, is utterly dull, and largely based on on-device models. Yes, there are people that use ChatGPT — 200 million of them a week, allegedly, losing the company money with every prompt — but there is little to suggest that there's widespread adoption of actual generative AI software. The Information reported in September that between 0.1% and 1% of the 440 million of Microsoft's business customers were paying for its AI-powered Copilot, and in late October, Microsoft claimed that "AI is on pace to be a $10 billion-a-year business," which sounds good until you consider a few things: I must be clear that every single one of these investments and products has been hyped with the whisper that they would get exponentially better over time, and that eventually the $200 billion in capital expenditures would spit out remarkable productivity improvements and fascinating new products that consumers and enterprises would buy in droves. Instead, big tech has found itself peddling increasingly-more-expensive iterations of near-identical Large Language Models — a direct result of them all having to use the same training data, which it’s now running out of. The other assumption — those so-called scaling laws — has been that by simply building bigger data centers with more GPUs (the expensive, power-hungry graphics processing units used to both run and train these models) and throwing as much training data at them as possible, they'd simply start sprouting new capabilities, despite there being little proof that they'd do so. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all burned billions on the assumption that doing so would create something — be it a human-level "artificial general intelligence" or, I dunno, a product that would justify the costs — and it's become painfully obvious that it isn't going to work. As we speak, outlets are already desperate to try and prove that this isn't a problem. The Information, in a similar story to Bloomberg's, attempted to put lipstick on the pig of generative AI, framing the lack of meaningful progress with GPT-5 as fine, because OpenAI can combine its GPT-5 Model with its o-1 "reasoning" model, which will then do something of some sort, such as "write a lot more very difficult code" according to OpenAI CEO and career liar Sam Altman, who intimated that GPT-5 may function like a "virtual brain" in May. Chief Valley Cheerleader Casey Newton wrote on Platformer last week that diminishing returns in training models "may not matter as much as you would guess," with his evidence being that Anthropic, who he claims "has not been prone to hyperbole," do not think that scaling laws are ending. To be clear, in a 14,000 op-ed that Newton wrote two pieces about, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that "AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure, most mental illness," the kind of hyperbole that should have you tarred and feathered in public. So, let me summarize: The entire tech industry has become oriented around a dead-end technology that requires burning billions of dollars to provide inessential products that cost them more money to serve than anybody would ever pay. Their big strategy was to throw even more money at the problem until one of these transformer-based models created a new, more useful product — despite the fact that every iteration of GPT and other models has been, well, iterative. There has never been any proof (other than benchmarks that are increasingly easier to game) that GPT or other models would become conscious, nor that these models would do more than they do today, or three months ago, or even a year ago. Yet things can, believe it or not, get worse. The AI boom helped the S&P 500 hit record high levels in 2024, largely thanks to chip giant NVIDIA, a company that makes both the GPUs necessary to train and run generative AI models and the software architecture behind them. Part of NVIDIA's remarkable growth has been its ability to capitalize on the CUDA architecture — the software layer that lets you do complex computing with GPUs, rather than simply use them to render video games in increasingly higher resolution — and, of course, continually create new GPUs to sell for tens of thousands of dollars to tech companies that want to burn billions of dollars on generative AI, leading the company's stock to pop more than 179% over the last year. Back in May, NVIDIA CEO and professional carnival barker Jensen Huang said that the company was now "on a one-year rhythm" in AI GPU production, with its latest "Blackwell" GPUs (specifically the B100, B200 and GB200 models used for generative AI) supposedly due at the end of 2024, but are now delayed until at least March 2025.Before we go any further, it's worth noting that when I say "GPU," I don't mean the one you'd find in a gaming PC, but a much larger chip put in a specialized server with multiple other GPUs, all integrated with specialized casing, cooling, and networking infrastructure. In simple terms, the things necessary to make sure all these chips work together efficiently, and also stop them from overheating, because they get extremely hot and are running at full speed, all the time. The initial delay of the new Blackwell chips was caused by a (now-fixed) design flaw in production, but as I've suggested above, the problem isn't just creating the chips — it's making sure they actually work, at scale, for the jobs they're bought for. But what if that, too, wasn't possible? A few days ago, The Information reported that NVIDIA is grappling with the oldest problem in computing — how to cool the fucking things. According to the report, NVIDIA has been asking suppliers to change the design of its 3,000-pound, 75-GPU server racks "several times" to overcome overheating problems, which The Information calls "the most complicated design NVIDIA had ever come up with." According to the report, a few months after revealing the racks, engineers found that they...didn't work properly, even with Nvidia’s smaller 36-chip racks, and have been scrambling to fix it ever since. While one can dazzle investors with buzzwords and charts, the laws of physics are a far harsher mistress, and if NVIDIA is struggling mere months before the first installations are to begin, it's unclear how it practically launches this generation of chips, let alone continues its yearly cadence. The Information reports that these changes have been made late in the production process, which is scaring customers that desperately need them so that their models can continue to do something they'll work out later. To quote The Information: The fact that NVIDIA is having such significant difficulties with thermal performance is very, very bad. These chips are incredibly expensive — as much as $70,000 a piece — and will be running, as I've mentioned, at full speed, generating an incredible amount of heat that must be dissipated, while sat next to anywhere from 35 to 71 other chips, which will in turn be densely packed so that you can cram more servers into a data center. New, more powerful chips require entirely new methods to rack-mount, operate and cool them, and all of these parts must operate in sync, as overheating GPUs will die. While these units are big, some of their internal components are microscopic in size, and unless properly cooled, their circuits will start to crumble when roasted by a guy typing "Garfield with Gun" into ChatGPT. Remember, Blackwell is supposed to represent a major leap forward in performance. If NVIDIA doesn’t solve its cooling problem — and solve it well — its customers will undoubtedly encounter thermal throttling, where the chip reduces speed in order to avoid causing permanent damage. It could eliminate any performance gains obtained from the new architecture and new manufacturing process, despite costing much, much more than its predecessor. NVIDIA's problem isn't just bringing these thermal performance issues under control, but both keeping them under control and being able to educate their customers on how to do so. NVIDIA has, according to The Information, repeatedly tried to influence its customers' server integrations to follow its designs because it thinks it will "lead to better performance," but in this case, one has to worry if NVIDIA's Blackwell chips can be reliably cooled. While NVIDIA might be able to fix this problem in isolation within its racks, it remains to be seen how this works at scale as they ship and integrate hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs starting in the front half of 2025. Things also get a little worse when you realize how these chips are being installed — in giant “supercomputer” data centers where tens of thousands, or as many as a hundred thousand in the case of Elon Musk’s “colossus” data center — of GPUs run in concert to power generative AI models. The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that building these vast data centers creates entirely new engineering challenges, with one expert saying that big tech companies could be using as much as half of their capital expenditures on replacing parts that have broken down, in large part because these clusters are running their GPUs at full speed, at all times. Remember, the capital expenditures on generative AI and the associated infrastructure have gone over $200 billion in the last year. If half of that’s dedicated to replacing broken gear, what happens when there’s no path to profitability? In any case, NVIDIA doesn’t care. It’s already made billions of dollars selling Blackwell GPUs — they're sold out for a year, after all — and will continue to do so for now, but any manufacturing or cooling issues will likely be costly. And even then, at some point somebody has to ask the question: why do we need all these GPUs if we've reached peak AI? Despite the remarkable "power" of these chips, NVIDIA's entire enterprise GPU business model centers around the idea that throwing more power at these problems will finally create some solutions. What if that isn't the case? The tech industry is over-leveraged, having doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on generative AI — a technology that doesn't do much more than it did a few months ago and won't do much more than it can do now. Every single big tech company has piled tens of billions of dollars into building out massive data centers with the intent of "capturing AI demand," yet never seemed to think whether they were actually building things that people wanted, or would pay for, or would somehow make the company money. While some have claimed that "agents are the next frontier," the reality is that agents may be the last generative AI product — multiple Large Language Models and integrations bouncing off of each other in an attempt to simulate what a human might do at a cost that won't be sustainable for the majority of businesses. While Anthropic's demo of its model allegedly controlling a few browser windows with a prompt might have seemed impressive to credulous people like Casey Newton, these were controlled demos which Anthropic added were "slow" and "made lots of mistakes." Hey, almost like it's hallucinating! I sure hope they fix that totally unfixable problem. Even if it does, Anthropic has now successfully replaced...an entry-level data worker position at an indeterminate and likely unprofitable price. And in many organizations, those jobs had already been outsourced, or automated, or staffed with cheaper contractors. The obscenity of this mass delusion is nauseating — a monolith to bad decision-making and the herd mentality of tech's most powerful people, as well as an outright attempt to manipulate the media into believing something was possible that wasn't. And the media bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted building giant data centers to crunch numbers for software that has no real product-market fit, all while trying to hammer it into various shapes to make it pretend that it's alive, conscious, or even a useful product. There is no path, from what I can see, to turn generative AI and its associated products into anything resembling sustainable businesses, and the only path that big tech appeared to have was to throw as much money, power, and data at the problem as possible, an avenue that appears to be another dead end. And worse still, nothing has really come out of this movement. I've used a handful of AI products that I've found useful — an AI powered journal, for example — but these are not the products that one associates with "revolutions," but useful tools that would have been a welcome surprise if they didn't require burning billions of dollars, blowing past emissions targets and stealing the creative works of millions of people to train them. I truly don't know what happens next, but I'll walk you through what I'm thinking. If we're truly at the diminishing returns stage of transformer-based models, it will be extremely difficult to justify buying further iterations of NVIDIA GPUs past Blackwell. The entire generative AI movement lives and dies by the idea that more compute power and more training data makes these things better, and if that's no longer the case, there's little reason to keep buying bigger and better. After all, what's the point? Even now, what exactly happens when Microsoft or Google has racks-worth of Blackwell GPUs? The models aren't going to get better. This also makes the lives of OpenAI and Anthropic that much more difficult. Sam Altman has grown rich and powerful lying about how GPT will somehow lead to AGI, but at this point, what exactly is OpenAI meant to do? The only way it’s ever been able to develop new models is by throwing masses of compute and training data at the problem, and its only other choice is to start stapling its reasoning model onto its main Large Language Model, at which point something happens, something so good that literally nobody working for OpenAI or in the media appears to be able to tell you what it is. Putting that aside, OpenAI is also a terrible business that has to burn $5 billion to make $3.4 billion, with no proof that it’s capable of bringing down costs. The constant refrain I hear from VCs and AI fantasists is that "chips will bring down the cost of inference," yet I don't see any proof of that happening, nor do I think it'll happen quickly enough for these companies to turn things around. And you can feel the desperation, too. OpenAI is reportedly looking at ads as a means to narrow the gap between its revenues and losses. As I pointed out in Burst Damage, introducing an advertising revenue stream would require significant upfront investment, both in terms of technology and talent. OpenAI would need a way to target ads, and a team to sell advertising — or, instead, use a third-party ad network that would take a significant bite out of its revenue. It’s unclear how much OpenAI could charge advertisers, or what percentage of its reported 200 million weekly users have an ad-blocker installed. Or, for that matter, whether ads would provide a perverse incentive for OpenAI to enshittify an already unreliable product. Facebook and Google — as I’ve previously noted — have made their products manifestly worse in order to increase the amount of time people spend on their sites, and thus, the number of ads they see. In the case of Facebook, it buried your newsfeed under a deluge of AI-generated sludge and “recommended content.” Google, meanwhile, has progressively degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase the volume of queries it received as a means of making sure users saw more ads. OpenAI could, just as easily, fall into the same temptation. Most people who use ChatGPT are trying to accomplish a specific task — like writing a term paper, or researching a topic, or whatever — and then they leave. And so, the amount of ads they’d conceivably see each will undoubtedly be comparatively low compared to a social network or search engine. Would OpenAI try to get users to stick around longer — to write more prompts — by crippling the performance of its models? Even if OpenAI listens to its better angels, the reality still stands: ads won’t dam the rising tide of red ink that promises to eventually drown the company. This is a truly dismal situation where the only options are to stop now, or continue burning money until the heat gets too much. It cost $100 million to train GPT-4o, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated a few months ago that training future models will cost $1 billion to $10 billion, with one researcher claiming that training OpenAI's GPT-5 will cost around $1 billion. And that’s before mentioning any, to quote a Rumsfeldism, “unknown unknowns.” Trump’s election, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, changes everything and in ways we don’t yet fully understand. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has successfully ingratiated himself with Trump, thanks to his early and full-throated support of his campaign. He’s now reportedly living in Mar a Lago, sitting on calls with world leaders, and whispering in Trump’s ear as he builds his cabinet. And, as The Journal claims, his enemies fear that he could use his position of influence to harm them or their businesses — chiefly Sam Altman, who is “persona non grata” in Musk’s world, largely due to the new for-profit direction of OpenAI. While it’s likely that these companies will fail due to inevitable organic realities (like running out of money, or not having a product that generates a profit), Musk’s enemies must now contend with a new enemy — one with the full backing of the Federal government, and that neither forgives nor forgets. And, crucially, one that’s not afraid to bend ethical or moral laws to further his own interests — or to inflict pain on those perceived as having slighted him. Even if Musk doesn’t use his newfound political might to hurt Altman and OpenAI, he could still pursue the company as a private citizen. Last Friday, he filed an injunction requesting a halt to OpenAI’s transformation from an ostensible non-profit to a for-profit business. Even if he ultimately fails, should Musk manage to drag the process out, or delay it temporarily, it could strike a terminal blow for OpenAI. That’s because in its most recent fundraise, OpenAI agreed that it would convert its recent $6.6bn equity investment into high-interest debt, should it fail to successfully convert into a for-profit business within a two-year period. This was a tight deadline to begin with, and it can’t afford any delays. The interest payments on that debt would massively increase its cash burn, and it would undoubtedly find it hard to obtain further outside investment. Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling.

Generative AI was a reckless pursuit, one that shows a total lack of creativity and sense in the minds of big tech and venture capital, one where there was never anything really impressive other than the amount of money it could burn and the amount of times Sam Altman could say something stupid and get quoted for it. I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what happens here. The future was always one that demanded that big tech spent more to make even bigger models that would at some point become useful, and that isn't happening. In pursuit of doing so, big tech invested hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure specifically to follow one goal, and put AI front and center at their businesses, claiming it was the future without ever considering what they'd do if it wasn't. The revenue isn't coming. The products aren't coming. "Orion," OpenAI's next model, will underwhelm, as will its competitors' models, and at some point somebody is going to blink in one of the hyperscalers, and the AI era will be over. Almost every single generative AI company that you’ve heard of is deeply unprofitable, and there are few innovations coming to save them from the atrophy of the foundation models. I feel sad and exhausted as I write this, drained as I look at the many times I’ve tried to warn people, frustrated at the many members of the media that failed to push back against the overpromises and outright lies of people like Sam Altman, and full of dread as I consider the economic ramifications of this industry collapsing. Once the AI bubble pops, there are no other hyper-growth markets left, which will in turn lead to a bloodbath in big tech stocks as they realize that they’re out of big ideas to convince the street that they’re going to grow forever. There are some that will boast about “being right” here, and yes, there is some satisfaction in being so. Nevertheless, knowing that the result of this bubble bursting will be massive layoffs, a dearth in venture capital funding, and a much more fragile tech ecosystem. I’ll end with a quote from Bubble Trouble, a piece I wrote in April: I was right then and I’m right now. Generative AI isn’t a revolution, it’s an evolution of a tech industry overtaken by growth-hungry management consultant types that neither know the problems that real people face nor how to fix them. It’s a sickening waste, a monument to the corrupting force of growth, and a sign that the people in power no longer work for you, the customer, but for the venture capitalists and the markets. I also want to be clear that none of these companies ever had a plan. They believed that if they threw enough GPUs together they would turn generative AI – probabilistic models for generating stuff — into some sort of sentient computer. It’s much easier, and more comfortable, to look at the world as a series of conspiracies and grand strategies, and far scarier to see it for what it is — extremely rich and powerful people that are willing to bet insanely large amounts of money on what amounts to a few PDFs and their gut. This is not big tech’s big plan to excuse building more data centers — it’s the death throes of twenty years of growth-at-all-costs thinking, because throwing a bunch of money at more servers and more engineers always seemed to create more growth. In practice, this means that the people in charge and the strategies they employ are borne not of an interest in improving the lives of their customers, but in increasing revenue growth, which means the products they create aren’t really about solving any problem other than “what will make somebody give me more money,” which doesn’t necessarily mean “provide them with a service.” Generative AI is the perfect monster of the Rot Economy — a technology that lacks any real purpose sold as if it could do literally anything, one without a real business model or killer app, proliferated because big tech no longer innovates, but rather clones and monopolizes. Yes, this much money can be this stupid, and yes, they will burn billions in pursuit of a non-specific dream that involves charging you money and trapping you in their ecosystem. I’m not trying to be a doomsayer, just like I wasn’t trying to be one in March. I believe all of this is going nowhere, and that at some point Google, Microsoft, or Meta is going to blink and pull back on their capital expenditures. And before then, you’re going to get a lot of desperate stories about how “AI gains can be found outside of training new models” to try and keep the party going, despite reality flicking the lights on and off and threatening to call the police. I fear for the future for many reasons, but I always have hope, because I believe that there are still good people in the tech industry and that customers are seeing the light. Bluesky feels different — growing rapidly, competing with both Threads and Twitter, all while selling an honest product and an open protocol. There are other ideas for the future that aren’t borne of the scuzzy mindset of billionaire shitheels like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, and they can — and will — grow out of the ruins created by these kleptocrats.

Title: Marc Benioff says humans are already working alongside AI agents

The future is here and it's humans working alongside robots, according to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Salesforce reported its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating revenue expectations and sending the stock price up around 10% as of market close on Wednesday. During the earnings call, Benioff made it clear he's all in on Agentforce, the company's service that clients can use to build AI-powered agents. AI agents, which can operate computers and complete tasks that might otherwise require human hands, have been touted by some as the next big thing in generative AI. Benioff seems to agree. Agentforce became generally available in late October and allows companies to create their own custom AI agents. Benioff said the company delivered 200 deals in that first week and that he expects demand for AI agents to increase, calling Salesforce the "largest supplier of digital labor." Benioff said some Salesforce clients already building out their digital labor force include FedEx, Adecco, Accenture, Ace Hardware, IBM, and RBC Wealth Managements. Benioff said that in addition to humans working alongside AI agents, they'll soon be working alongside robots as well. "On top of this agentic layer, we'll soon see a robotic layer as well where these agents will manifest into robots," he said, adding, "These agents are not tools. They are becoming collaborators." Benioff has previously said he thought the "upper limits" of large language models, which power chatbots like ChatGPT, had been reached and that the future was AI agents. Salesforce isn't the only tech company focusing on agents. Microsoft helps customers create agents through its AI studio, Copilot. Meta is working on agents, Google its making AI agents with Gemini, and Bloomberg recently reported OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, plans to launch AI agents next year. Benioff also said on the earnings call that the rise in digital labor means "productivity is no longer tied to workforce growth, but to this intelligent technology that can be scaled without limits." "This isn't just some far off future," he added, "It's happening right now." Jump to

Joshua Isner, President of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON), recently sold a significant amount of the company's stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transactions took place on December 3 and December 4, 2024.

In other recent news, Axon Enterprise Inc. reported a robust third-quarter performance, with record bookings and a 32% year-over-year growth in revenue.

This robust performance comes on the heels of the integration of recently acquired Dedrone and the launch of new AI-driven products.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, Dow, S&P 500 hit records as tech surges, Fed's Powell says economy in 'remarkably good shape'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A tech rally boosted US stocks on Wednesday, with all three major indexes hitting new record closes, as investors digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that US economy is in "remarkably good shape." The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed about 0.7%, or over 300 points, to close above 45,000 for the first time ever. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.6% for a fresh closing high of 6,086.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 1.3%, clinching a record of its own at 19,735.12. Cloud and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) hit intraday all-time highs on Wednesday, as did iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) gained over 3%, nearing its own record. Salesforce (CRM) stock surged 11% after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its artificial intelligence products. Markets kept moving higher as Powell spoke at the New York Times DealBook Summit and did little to shake investor confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates at its December meeting. Powell touted a US economy in "remarkably good shape" as a reason he feels the Fed can be "afford to be a little more cautious" in its interest rate cutting path. The central bank is widely expected to lower rates at its Dec. 18 meeting. Traders see near 77% odds of a 25 basis point cut, compared with around 67% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. On that economic strength: A reading on private payrolls suggested the labor market is softening — but not too much. The report is one of several key economic releases this week, leading into the all-important monthly jobs report on Friday. In corporate news, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) halted its investor day after the CEO of insurance unit UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy All three major indexes clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday while bitcoin (BTC-USD) headed for a milestone of its own. The world's largest cryptocurrency quickly gained steam in the afternoon, nearly touching $100,000 per coin for the first time ever, as investors digested President-elect Donald Trump's nomination for chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin's prior all-time high is $99,655.50 per coin. Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins, who is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official. The former SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. The labor market has showed signs of further cooling in the second half of 2024. But there have still be an occasional signs of labor market tightness within data, as seen in a Wednesday release from ADP. New data from ADP released Wednesday showed that the median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers rose to 7.2% in November, up from 6.7% in October. Meanwhile, the year-over-year pay increase for job stayers rose to 4.8% from 4.7% the month prior, marking the first monthly increase in wage growth for job stayers in 25 months. "Job changers are the most sensitive to real time labor market conditions," ADP chief economist Nela Richardson told Yahoo Finance. "So if they're getting paid a little bit more in November than they did in October, that tells you that there's a labor market out there that's still a little tight. And that is meaningful to the fed." Specifically, Richardson added, it could be a challenge for a Fed that's already been digesting inflation prints that have shown little progress in recent months. "As long as you have sticky inflation and strong wage growth, you can't be on a preset course to cutting rates, because that could come and bite you later," Richardson said. "So I think they're still going to be very cautious, very data dependent." A rally in megacap tech helped lift US equities on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied more than 3% while Amazon (AMZN) popped more than 2%. All of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this week, with each stock rising more than 2% in the past three trading days compared to the benchmark index's less than 1% gain. We recently highlighted that these stocks have also been seeing stronger earnings revisions over the past month compared to the S&P 500, perhaps one of the driver's behind the recent market action. "US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings," DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a recent note. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that recent economic data could lead to a "cautious" interest rate-cutting cycle. In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell said the US economy is in "remarkably good shape." Given that, and how recent data has calmed concerns over how rapidly the US labor market is weakening, Powell believes the Fed won't need to rapidly cut interest rates while the central bank waits for inflation to fall to its 2% goal. "We can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," Powell said. Over the past few years, a stronger-than-expected US economy has continuously surprised Wall Street and its projections. While we've become somewhat used to them now, the recent underestimations are a reversal of what was seen prior to the pandemic when US economic forecasts were often too lofty, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Yahoo Finance. And now, heading into 2025, strategists like Calvasina are leaning into the post-pandemic trend and betting consensus economic forecasts will once again be surprised to the upside by the US economy. "Given that history recently of underestimating [US economic growth] and the fact that GDP forecasts for next year are creeping up very, very, very slowly, I'm making a bet on the 2% to 3% [growth] instead of the 1% to 2%," said Calvasina, who sees the S&P 500 ending next year at 6,600. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo's Christopher Harvey issued the most bullish target on Wall Street at 7,007 while highlighting a "cyclical opportunity catalyzed by upward GDP revisions." If 2024's market driving abbreviation was AI, 2025's is set to be GDP. Read more here. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Atkins, currently the CEO at Patomak Global Partners, served as SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration from 2002 to 2008. Unlike his potential predecessor Gary Gensler, who is set to leave office in January 2025, Atkins is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official and currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. "He's certainly a person that is known for streamlining regulation and being very pro-digital assets, and very knowledgeable in the industry," Carlos Domingo, the founder and CEO of Securitize, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) moved slightly higher on the news and was trading just north of $96,000 per coin in afternoon trade. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) touched intraday record highs on Wednesday as markets edged higher, buoyed by tech stocks. The S&P 500 Tech sector (XLK) outperformed, jumping about 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed after a strong quarterly report from software maker Salesforce (CRM). UnitedHealth Group (UNH) released a statement Wednesday following the fatal shooting in Manhattan of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. “We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson," read the company statement. "Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.” Thompson was shot outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where the company was holding its investor day. UnitedHealth halted the event this morning following the shooting. President-elect Donald Trump has asked Peter Navarro to be senior counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. Navarro served under Trump's first term as White House trade adviser. "I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing," wrote Trump on social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. "During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American," wrote Trump. Amazon (AMZN) hit an all-time high on Wednesday amid the company’s AWS re:Invent 2024 cloud conference. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant rose more than 2% in early trading. On Wednesday, numerous Wall Street analysts reaffirmed their bullish Buy ratings on the stock, citing the company's artificial intelligence capabilities. The stock has 77 Buy ratings, 5 Holds, and zero Sells. Amazon shares are up 43% year to date. Foot Locker (FL) shares tumbled 12% in early trading after the footwear retailer cut its full-year guidance while missing third quarter estimates, citing weak consumer demand. "Consumer spending trends softened following the peak Back-to-School period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated," the company said in its quarterly release. The stock is down more than 30% year to date. US stocks edged higher on Wednesday, as tech rose, led by shares of Salesforce (CRM). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.4%, or around 200 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3% on the heels of an all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.7%. Salesforce (CRM) stock climbed around 8% in early trading after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its AI products.

World Labs, a startup co-founded by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li earlier this year that quickly grabbed the attention of high-profile investors, has remained relatively quiet on its products—until now. The startup yesterday (Dec. 3) provided a glimpse of one of its early projects, which takes the form of virtual 3D scenes generated from a 2D image. “This will change how we make movies, games, simulators and other digital manifestations of our physical worlds,” said World Labs in a blog post accompanied by interactive examples of its 3D worlds. The preview shines a light on Li’s larger efforts to develop A.I. models that have “spatial intelligence” and can understand and interact with the real world. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Based on images of landscapes, urban scenes and even artwork from painters like Vincent van Gogh and Edward Hopper, World Labs creates entire 3D worlds that users can explore—albeit with some barriers, such as a limit on how large the interactive area is. According to the startup, this 3D content provides more control than typical 2D A.I. content, as it allows users to adjust aspects like field of depth or play with camera dolly zooms. Often referred to as the “Godmother of A.I.” for her contributions to the field, Li in the 2000s played a large role in the release of ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that helped kickstart pivotal advances in machine learning. She is currently on partial leave from her role as co-director of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered A.I. to work on World Labs, which Li established earlier this year alongside fellow A.I. researchers Justin Johnson, Ben Mildenhall and Christoph Lassner. The startup in September raised some $230 million in a round led by Radical Ventures, a Canadian venture capital firm where Li serves as a partner, with the participation of Andreessen Horowitz and NEA. Other World Lab investors include “A.I. godfather” Geoffrey Hinton, former Google (GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn (LNKD) co-founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, and Nvidia (NVDA)’s venture capital arm, NVentures. World Labs’ primary goal is developing the ability to take action with vision or perception within A.I. models—a type of intelligence that took 540 million years to evolve in the human brain. “If we want to advance A.I. beyond its current capabilities, we want more than A.I. that can see and talk. We want A.I. that can do,” Li said during a TED Talk in April. This week’s initial preview is just an early look at what World Labs hopes to eventually accomplish. The company said it has offered early access to its technology to digital content creators like Eric Solorio and Brittani Natali. “We are hard at work improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways for users to interact with them,” said World Labs.

Title: Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever. Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself. Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses. But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds. “They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.” In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder. The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world. Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems. Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal. Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger. “Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.” Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money. But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult. “I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?” If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses. “You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.” While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips. “I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. "There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.” Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Why Is Kura Oncology, Inc. (KURA) Among the Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks With Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks with Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) stands against the other small-cap biotech stocks. The biotechnology sector is expanding quickly due to rising demand for novel therapies, technological advances, and government assistance. Advances in fields like gene editing, sequencing, personalized medicine, and artificial intelligence are making new techniques possible, while the aging population and growing healthcare demands are driving a robust market for new treatments. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, venture capital firms made approximately $52 billion in global investments in therapeutic-focused biotech companies between 2019 and 2021. Two-thirds of this sum was given to platform-tech start-up companies. Despite its growth, many biotech companies have faced challenges in turbulent markets, taking drastic measures such as cutting programs and implementing significant layoffs to conserve cash. While recent rate cuts could encourage the revival of scientific projects, analysts like Jared Holz note the difficulty of gauging their impact. Holz also highlighted a shift in market dynamics, observing that biotech's performance increasingly correlates with small-cap equities. If small-cap stocks trade well, biotech is likely to follow, though stagnation could occur if momentum fades. Notably, the idea of interest rates predicting biotech success is relatively new, emerging only after the pandemic, which reshaped the industry by driving substantial investment into therapeutic-focused companies. With innovative treatments, biotech businesses are revolutionizing healthcare by tackling important unmet medical needs. Establishing the National Bioeconomy Board as a component of Biden's Investing in America agenda is a significant breakthrough. It seeks to maximize biotechnology's economic potential in the United States. Furthermore, policy suggestions to expedite the approval process for biotechnology goods are being developed by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. More academics will be able to use biotechnology for agricultural purposes if entry obstacles are reduced, which will benefit American farmers and increase food security. It is anticipated that these initiatives will open up new markets. This year (2024) started strongly for the biotechnology sector due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions as well as anticipations of falling interest rates. Therefore, estimates suggest that the worldwide biotechnology market might increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 14% from 2024 to 2033, reaching an astonishing $5.7 trillion. The market for agricultural biotechnology is also expected to develop at a 7.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $232 billion by 2032. But even with the market's potential, investing in biotech companies still carries a number of serious dangers. Bankruptcy may result from failing to satisfy clinical trial endpoints or obtain adequate finance before a product launch. In the biotech industry, where drug development usually takes more than ten years and has an estimated failure rate of about 90%, the danger of failure is very substantial. Hence, biotech stocks are often considered “high-risk, high-reward” investments due to their upside potential coupled with significant risks In our methodology, we identified the top small-cap biotech stocks with significant growth potential, ranked according to their total hedge fund holdings as of Q2 2024. Our selection process began by filtering companies with a small market capitalization. Next, we reviewed analyst recommendations, focusing on stocks with strong bullish sentiment and high institutional ownership. Finally, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding their shares as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharmaceutical researcher intently studying results from a clinical trial. Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 36 Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. At its core, the company designs and develops targeted therapies that aim to improve outcomes for patients with various types of solid tumors and blood cancers. A major catalyst for Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is the development of ziftomenib, its lead drug candidate. Ziftomenib, an oral medication targeting the menin-MLL1 protein-protein interaction, has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This designation could accelerate the drug's path to market, potentially leading to increased revenue and market share. Another catalyst is the company's expanding clinical trial program. The corporation has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib (KOMET-001) and is conducting multiple clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standard-of-care regimens. Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) reported significant financial developments in Q3 2024, with research and development expenses increasing to $41.7 million from $29.3 million in Q3 2023 which was driven by higher clinical trial costs for key programs such as ziftomenib and KO-2806. General and administrative expenses also rose to $18.2 million from $13.1 million, contributing to a net loss of $54.4 million, up from $38.6 million in the prior year. The company maintains a strong cash position of $455.3 million, ensuring operational funding into 2027. As of the third quarter of 2024, 36 hedge funds had investments in the company, with Suvretta Capital Management being the largest shareholder, holding stakes valued at $149.5 million, according to the Insider Monkey database. Analysts on Wall Street have a consensus Strong Buy rating for the stock. Over the past three months, analysts have set a 12-month price target of $30.89, with estimates ranging from a low of $22.00 to a high of $37.00. This represents a potential upside of 52.47% from the current price of $20.26. Overall KURA ranks 2nd on our list of the best small-cap biotech stocks with massive potential according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KURA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KURA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Also: UnitedHealthcare responds after CEO fatally shot during meeting; American adults view media as being as biased as ever. Edelman is laying off 330 staff members, or over 5% of its workforce, as part of a global restructuring effort. The global PR agency also plans to sunset several of its subsidiary boutique agencies. [RELATED: Take the first step in achieving communications excellence] As part of its company announcement, CEO Richard Edelman issued a statement to the company (and the broader industry) providing context about the “simplification of our firm’s structure.” “Clients now require integration of specialist services into the larger firm for speedy access to our geographic reach, deep industry knowledge and creative ability,” the statement reads. “We are best when we bring the full force of Edelman to the complex problems facing our clients. Corporate affairs, marketing and government affairs are now all closely aligned on the client side. We are skating to where the puck will be — everything is interconnected now.” As part of a restructuring, Edelman will shutter Edible, Revere, Salutem, Mustache, EGA and Delta brands. However, it plans to keep open three of its specialty arms: Edelman Smithfield (financial communications), DXI (research) and UEG (experiential marketing). Those boutique firms will serve as the “connective tissue” between Edelman and the related Zeno Group and RUTH. The agency will also maintain two client-specific entities — Assembly for Microsoft and Kinisi for J&J. Edelman plans to keep open its 60 global offices. Why it matters: Edelman is one of the biggest players in the PR game, and if it’s making a move, it’s important for the entire industry to take note. In this context, that appears to be moving – or “skating,” as Richard Edelman described it – toward a more integrated model. As Axios reported, Edelman is working “to take money away from classic marketing agencies and compete for budgets that [they] couldn’t have before.” But the changes are also about becoming more “nimble and agile.” While still a $1 billion revenue business, Edelman saw its revenue drop by about 8% last year – and further efficiency would likely help change that trend. It’s not clear if the growth of artificial intelligence is part of that changing model or the cuts in staff. But Edelman has emphasized its commitment to investing in its own AI technology. “We are investing in our own large language model premised on 25 years of Trust data that enables AI as a predictive tool, both communications and action, enabling better decisions by business related to trust,” Richard Edelman said. Following the downsizing, he told Axios positions affected by the downsizing “about evenly split” between “vice president and up” and “account executive to account supervisor.” But he also stressed in his company statement to deliver on client needs “with senior people leading every engagement.” That suggests the Edelman team really wants to use in-house staff time on strategy when and where possible. To that end, Edelman has hired over 200 creative employees in Colombia and plans to staff up in India and South Africa, per Axios. Keep an eye on next steps for Edelman, as it could be a strong sign of what’s in store for the industry. Editor’s Top News A newly released survey from the Pew Research Center suggests the overwhelming majority of American adults believe mainstream news coverage has a bias when discussing political or social issues. The September survey, which published Monday, found that 77% of U.S. adults believe news organizations tend to go either left or right when presenting on those topics. That number represents about nine-in-ten Republicans (88%), compared with 67% of Democrats. Far fewer (22%) believe news organizations deal fairly with all sides. The poll is near the highest share of Americans who say so since it started in 1985. In an era where people are increasingly turning to social media influencers and podcasts over traditional news, this poses a challenge for traditional earned media. Trust is key, and if a team can’t trust the reporter or their perspective on a particular subject, it won’t resonate with target audiences as it should. This doesn’t mean you should give up on your earned media strategy entirely. But now, as much as ever, PR teams must thoroughly vet the reporters and publications and closely examine sentiment scores. Casey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily. Follow him on LinkedIn. Topics: Daily Scoop Topics: Daily Scoop As someone familiar with Edelman, I can confirm the number is closer to 500 employees. Considering the company’s reported financial challenges, there’s been speculation among staff about the necessity and timing of Nikki Haley’s hire three months ago, given that her compensation is likely significant.

Title: Sam Altman isn't worried about Elon Musk's relationship with Donald Trump

As his former colleague and artificial intelligence rival prepares for a role in the incoming Trump administration, Sam Altman says he’s not worried about Elon Musk. Despite there being “lots of things not to like about” Musk, it would go against the billionaire’s values to hurt competitors, the OpenAI chief executive said during an interview at the New York Times (NYT+1.43%) DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “I may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,” Altman said. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA+0.27%) reported that Altman and other tech and business leaders who have drawn Musk’s ire are worried about the influence he could have on regulation. Altman reportedly reached out to his connections in Trump’s circle, including the President-elect’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his brother, Joshua Kushner, head of major OpenAI investor Thrive Capital. Altman also reportedly asked a mutual friend to set up a meeting with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 before leaving over a conflict of interest in 2018, announced in September that his AI startup, xAI, had brought “the most powerful AI training system in the world” online after only 122 days. The Colossus training cluster is powered by 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA-2.99%) H100 training chips and “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of the more powerful Nvidia H200 chips, Musk said. Altman said he assumes xAI will “be a really serious competitor” to OpenAI. “I have different feelings about him [Musk] now, but I’m still glad he exists,” Altman said. “Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think he, at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously.” Additionally, Altman said ChatGPT’s search feature is his “favorite product we’ve launched in a long time,” and that OpenAI will announce new launches and demos for the next 12 business days starting on Thursday.

Title: Barron’s Analyst Predicts AI Shift from Training to Inference Could Impact NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s GPU Dominance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. AI companies in Europe are competing with American counterparts for a larger slice of the AI cake in Asia and the Middle East. For example, French AI firm LightOn recently revealed plans to expand in the Middle East, targeting sectors such as banking, defense, and high-tech which require their data to be protected on local servers. According to a report by news agency Reuters, Laurent Daudet, the CEO of the firm, noted that banking, insurance, high-tech, defense, and healthcare were prime targets for the custom AI models from LightOn. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The report further highlights that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring countries were among those being looked at by LightOn. The AI firms just recently debuted on the stock market, becoming the first listed genAI company on the Euronext Growth exchange. The demand for LightOn products is growing. Per Orange AI Chief Steve Jarrett, customers want a French-trusted AI solution.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Finance news expert Adam Clark recently opined in a piece for finance publication Barron’s that the focus of the AI industry will inevitably shift from training to inference as AI firms face challenges in their quest to build ever-larger AI models. This shift, per Clark, has big implications for NVIDIA. In his piece, the author noted that while training was uniquely suited to the company's GPUs, inference might be more readily handled by AI processors from NVIDIA peers like AMD and Intel, by custom chips from Amazon, or by a range of chip start-ups. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The Dow surged nearly 300 points on Wednesday, driven by gains in Salesforce and other tech stocks. In the afternoon, the Dow climbed 272 points or 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq rose by 1.1%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached fresh record highs, signaling continued optimism in the equity markets. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the afternoon that the Fed can proceed “cautiously” while reducing interest rates. The central bank’s next meeting to discuss rate cuts is scheduled for December 17-18.

U.S. companies added 146,000 jobs during the month, falling short of the downwardly revised 184,000 jobs added in October and missing the estimate of 163,000. The softer labor data has fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve might consider a rate cut to support economic growth. Shares of Salesforce (CRM-2.26% reached a new 52-week high today as it posted better-than-expected earnings. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.41 on an adjusted basis, falling slightly short of the $2.44 analysts had anticipated.

That could be an ominous sign for the market, and for the funds themselves as glitches emerge. Leveraged single stock ETFs hit a record of $17 billion of trading volume on Nov. 21, according Strategas ETF strategist Todd Sohn. Several issuers have launched these funds in recent years, typically tracking stocks with high volatility like Nvidia, Tesla and MicroStrategy. "The entire leveraged cohort is just 0.4% of U.S. ETF AUM, but with trading volume as % of total constantly flirting with the 8-9% range recently – that's up from 4% at the start of the year and we find the growth rate curious with equities trading at an all-time high," Sohn said in a note to clients last week. The volume would seem more likely to spike during downturns in the market, when general volatility rises, not well into a bull market, Sohn said. Their recent popularity could be a warning sign about euphoria among some investors. "Pair this off with the continued surge of inflows to equity ETFs and it creates a developing case of hot sentiment. Keep in mind – year 3 of a bull market is often a trickier backdrop than the initial years off major market lows," Sohn said. Similarly, Morningstar senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff told CNBC the rise of these types of leveraged funds funds is indicative of a "gambling mentality" in the market and that investors would be better off avoiding them altogether. For now, the broader Wall Street rally is still intact, but there are new signs of strain for some of the single stock ETFs. One of the big concerns around leveraged funds in general is that they are only designed to meet their stated return on a daily basis. Because of a characteristic often called "volatility drift," investors can expect leveraged long funds in particular to underperform the goal on the label over longer time horizons. But the soaring popularity of leveraged funds for MicroStrategy in particular has surfaced a different problem: the funds are struggling to track the volatile crypto-linked stock on even a daily basis. Return data from FactSet shows that, in the five trading days leading up to Thanksgiving, two major leveraged long MicroStrategy funds had multiple trading sessions where their return differed from the stated goal by more than 2 percentage points. The single stock funds typically buy swap agreements from banks to lock in the leveraged exposure. However, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU) and the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) have both turned to options to generate leverage in recent days because there wasn't enough supply in the swaps market, the firms behind the funds confirmed to CNBC, which could make it more difficult to achieve the goals of the funds. The two funds have more than $4 billion in combined assets, according to their websites. The heavy demand for the funds, combined with the high volatility of MicroStrategy itself, appears to be scaring off financial firms from helping facilitate these leveraged bets on the stock with swaps. "Every strategy has its limits at some point. Sometimes it's like a structural thing where the market just cannot handle any more, like you're kind of seeing now. Sometimes its more based on the particulars of the strategy," Sotiroff said. Despite the recent issues, the single stock ETF boom is still growing. On Tuesday, Defiance launched the Daily Target 2X Long NVO ETF (NVOX), giving leveraged exposure to the stock of obesity drug maker Novo Nordisk. Got a confidential news tip?

DORTMUND, GERMANY - JANUARY 15: A police officer demonstrates the handling of an Taser on January ... [+] 15, 2021 in Dortmund, Germany. Police in North Rhine-Westphalia will begin using the Axon Taser 7 electroshock devices in a two-year pilot project, after which authorities will assess whether the devices will become standard issue. Similar pilot projects are underway in other German states. (Photo by Sascha Schuermann/Getty Images) We believe that AeroVironment stock,, a drone and uncrewed vehicle maker, is a better pick than its industry peer, Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON), best known for its products for the law enforcement agencies, including taser and body cams. AXON stock trades at 27x trailing revenues, versus 7x for AVAV stock, thanks to Axon’s superior revenue growth and profitability. However, we think this gap in valuation will narrow in favor of AeroVironment in the coming years. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation for these stocks. Separately, check out Why Is Salesforce Stock Up 12%? AXON stock has seen stellar gains of 435% from levels of $125 in early January 2021 to around $670 now, vs. an increase of 130% for AVAV stock. This compares with about 60% gains for the broader S&P 500 index over this roughly four-year period. Admirably, AXON stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. This was not the case for AeroVironment, with its stock seeing returns of -29%, 38%, and 47% in the last three years, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 – indicating that AVAV underperformed the S&P in 2021. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Industrials sector including MMM, UPS, and HON, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Axon has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 32% from $681 million in 2020 to $1.9 billion now. On the other hand, AeroVironment’s average revenue growth rate of 22% from $395 million in fiscal 2021 (fiscal ends in April) to $754 million now, has been comparatively slower. Also see, What’s Happening With PFE Stock? Axon’s revenue growth lately has been led by increased demand for taser and body cams. The company is benefiting from increased adoption for its products, amid continued innovation. For example, Axon’s Draft One uses generative AI to convert the audio from the body cam into a report narrative draft. Also, it can translate over 100 languages. Such offerings help improve the efficiency of the police force. Looking at the latest quarter, Axon’s sales were up a solid 32% y-o-y, driven by a 36% jump in its Cloud & Services business, while Sensors & Other revenue was up 18%. AeroVironment’s revenue growth lately is being driven by its uncrewed systems and loitering munitions systems (kamikaze drones). The loitering munitions systems sales were up a whopping 60% y-o-y in fiscal 2024, while the uncrewed systems revenue were up 30%. Given the elevated geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Europe, there is an increased demand for uncrewed systems, bolstering AeroVironment’s top-line growth. AeroVironment’s Switchblade are employed in Ukraine. Just a few months back, the U.S. army awarded a $1 billion contract to AeroVironment for its kamikaze drones. Looking forward, we expect both companies to see strong revenue growth in the coming years. Still, we think Axon is likely to fare better, with its sales expected to nearly double from $1.6 billion in 2023 to around $3 billion in 2026. We think AeroVironment’s sales could rise by over 40% over this period. Axon’s operating margin declined from 63% in 2020 to 51% in 2023, while AeroVironment’s operating margin contracted from 11% in fiscal 2021 to 10% in fiscal 2024. If we look at the last twelve-month period, Axon’s operating margin of 54% fares much better than 9% for AeroVironment. Looking at financial risk, Axon has an edge over AeroVironment. Although its 1% debt as a percentage of equity is similar to AeroVironment, its 33% cash as a percentage of assets is much higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that both companies have a good debt position, but Axon has more cash cushion. While Axon has a better revenue growth, is more profitable, and offers lower financial risk, its stock has run up quite a bit. It’s up a stellar 160% this year, of which, over a 55% move came in a month. We think AXON is now slightly overpriced. At its current levels of $670, AXON trades at 27x trailing revenues, which is much higher than the stock’s average P/S ratio of 12x over the last three years. Now, some rise in valuation multiple seems warranted, given the strong sales and earnings growth. An increased adoption of its products bodes well for the stock in the long run, given that the company earns recurring revenues from sales of cartridges and services for its products. Furthermore, with Trump in the White House, law enforcement agencies are expected to be well funded under the new administration. There is a possibility of increased spending on technologies and products to improve security. Now, this factor bodes well for both Axon and AeroVironment. In comparison, AVAV stock, at levels of $193, trades at 7x trailing revenues, slightly higher than the stock’s average P/S ratio of 6x over the last three years. With increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the demand for drones may remain high. This implies more sales of drones. Ukraine is employing AeroVironment’s drones, Israel also received hundreds of kamikaze drones. The latest $1 billion contract from the U.S. army also reflects the increasing demand for drones. We think AVAV stock deserves an upward revision in valuation multiple. Notably, the $228 average of analysts’ price estimate reflects nearly a 20% upside from the current levels and factors an 8x P/S ratio. While AVAV looks a better pick over AXON, it is helpful to see other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at Why Is Salesforce Stock Up 12%?

New offerings position Invesco as the provider with the most expansive set of ETF assets that access unique exposures of the groundbreaking companies within Nasdaq Indexes ATLANTA, Dec. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd . (NYSE: NYSE:IVZ), a leading global asset management firm, announced today the expansion of the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to include Invesco Top QQQ ETF (QBIG) and Invesco QQQ Low Volatility ETF (QQLV). The newest additions to the firm's popular family of QQQ strategies further positions the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as the most expansive set of ETFs, by assets under management (AUM)1, to offer unique and varied exposures to the innovative companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index ®. "We're excited that the longstanding partnership between Nasdaq and Invesco continues to result in the launch of unique, innovative ETFs, positioning Invesco as the leading provider of Nasdaq-100 ETFs1," says Brian Hartigan, Invesco's Global Head of ETFs & Index Investments. "QBIG and QQLV will offer investors additional ways to access to the Nasdaq Indexes that meet their desired investment outcomes. These ETFs further advance the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as a 'one stop shop' for innovation that offers investors a range of differentiated ETFs." The ETFs offer different exposures to the Nasdaq-100 Index, giving investors an opportunity to either access high beta or low beta versions of the Nasdaq-100 Index and providing options for both potential greater upside capture or potential downside mitigation. The two strategies consider the ever-changing economic landscape by giving shareholders two unique exposures to forward-thinking companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index. QBIG is an actively managed ETF that uses a rules-based approach to track the Nasdaq-100 Mega™ Index ®, which captures the top 45% of companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. Invesco believes this approach is the most effective way to gain targeted exposure to innovation through high growth, mega-cap companies. Focusing on the top 45%, rather than specific named companies or a specific number of companies such as the "Magnificent 72," or previously, "FANMAG3" and "FAANG4", allows QBIG to be prepared for any potential shifts that may occur in the mega-cap landscape. QBIG's methodology adjusts on a quarterly basis for the inevitable and continuously evolving fluctuations in the composition of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index over a longer time horizon. QQLV is the first ETF in the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to offer exposure to low volatility companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. The passively managed fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility™ Index ®, which identifies the least volatile companies over the trailing 12 months within the Nasdaq-100 Index, offering investors access to growth companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index determined to have lower volatility. "Invesco and Nasdaq have been breaking new ground together for years, and we are excited to partner on two new additions to the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite," said Emily Spurling, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Index at Nasdaq. "For nearly 40 years, our flagship Nasdaq-100 Index has been the benchmark for innovation, and we are pleased Invesco can offer investors access to the concentrated companies in the Nasdaq-100 Mega Index and low volatility factor captured by the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility Index." With the launch of QBIG and QQLV, investors now have a robust suite of ETFs that access different exposures and strategies of the Nasdaq Indexes. QQLV offers exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index ® in a more conservative style, and could complement QBIG by offering an opportunity to invest in both ends of the Nasdaq-100 Index beta spectrum. QQLV also offers juxtaposition to the concentration risk of holding the largest mega-cap companies of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

Important Information: Invesco Distributors, Inc. is not affiliated with Nasdaq. Basis points, as known as bps, are a unit of measurement. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01% or 0.0001 in decimal form. The Nasdaq-100 Index ® is composed of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market ® based on market capitalization. The Nasdaq-100 Mega™ Index is designed to target the performance of approximately the Top 45% cumulative weight of the Nasdaq-100 Index ® (NDX ®). The Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility™ Index is designed to track the performance of the bottom quartile of the Nasdaq-100 Index ® (NDX ®) based on 12-month realized volatility. An investment cannot be made directly into an index. About Risk: There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Index-based ETFs are not actively managed. Actively managed ETFs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Both index-based and actively managed ETFs are subject to risks similar to stocks, including those related to short selling and margin maintenance. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as information technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. QQLV Investments focused in a particular sector are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. The Fund may become "non-diversified," as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of the Index. Shareholder approval will not be sought when the Fund crosses from diversified to non-diversified status under such circumstances. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not utilize an investing strategy that seeks returns in excess of its Underlying Index. Therefore, the Fund would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from its Underlying Index, even if that security generally is underperforming. QBIG Market Risk. Securities held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations. You should anticipate that the value of the Shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Additionally, natural or environmental disasters, widespread disease or other public health issues, war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, economic crises or other events could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's net asset value ("NAV"). Management Risk. The Fund is subject to management risk because a portion of its assets are actively managed. In managing certain of the Fund's investment sleeves and other portfolio holdings, the Adviser applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment and asset allocation decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these actions will produce the desired results. Index Risk. While a portion of the Fund's portfolio is actively managed, another portion of the Fund's portfolio is designed to track the performance of the Index. In managing this portion of the Fund's portfolio, the portfolio managers will not generally buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the Index, regardless of the performance of that security. If a specific security is removed from the Index, the Fund may be forced to sell such security at an inopportune time or for a price lower than the security's current market value. The Index may not contain the appropriate mix of securities for any particular economic cycle. Equity Risk. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. Swap Agreements Risk. Swaps involve greater risks than direct investments. Swaps are subject to leveraging, liquidity and counterparty risks, and therefore may be difficult to value. Adverse changes in the value or level of the swap can result in gains or losses that are substantially greater than invested, with the potential for unlimited loss. Industry Concentration Risk. Investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Technology Industry Risk. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than traditional investments and are subject to market, interest rate, credit, leverage, counterparty and management risks. An investment in a derivative could lose more than the cash amount invested. Futures Contracts Risk. Risks of futures contracts include: an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying commodity; possible lack of a liquid secondary market; inability to close a futures contract when desired; losses due to unanticipated market movements; obligation for the Fund to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin; failure to close a position may result in the Fund receiving an illiquid commodity; and unfavorable execution prices. Counterparty Risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party to the contract will not fulfill its contractual obligations, which may cause losses or additional costs. Leverage Risk. Leverage created from borrowing or certain types of transactions or instruments may impair the fund's liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at an unfavorable time or lose more than it invested, increase volatility or otherwise not achieve its intended objective. Cash/Cash Equivalent Risk. To the extent the Fund holds cash or cash equivalents rather than securities or other instruments in which it primarily invests, the Fund risks losing opportunities to participate in market appreciation and may experience potentially lower returns. Collateral Securities Risk. Collateral may include obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, including bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, money market funds and corporate debt securities, such as commercial paper. Although the Fund may hold securities that carry U.S. government guarantees, these guarantees do not extend to shares of the Fund. Money market funds are subject to management fees and other expenses. Therefore, investments in money market funds will cause the Fund to bear indirectly a proportional share of the fees and costs of the money market funds in which it invests. At the same time, the Fund will continue to pay its own management fees and expenses with respect to all of its assets, including any portion invested in the shares of the money market fund. It is possible to lose money by investing in money market funds. Corporate debt securities such as commercial paper generally are short-term unsecured promissory notes issued by businesses. Corporate debt may be rated investment-grade or below investment-grade and may carry variable, or floating, rates of interest. Corporate debt securities carry both credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk is the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer of a corporate debt security is unable to pay interest or repay principal when it is due. Some corporate debt securities that are rated below investment-grade generally are considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss, including default, than higher quality debt securities. U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations issued by US Government agencies and instrumentalities may receive varying levels of support from the government, which could affect the fund's ability to recover should they default. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. Portfolio Size Risk. The Fund typically will hold a small number of positions. To the extent that a significant portion of the Fund's total assets is invested in a limited number of holdings, the appreciation or depreciation of any one position may have a greater impact on the Fund's NAV than it would if the Fund held a greater number of constituents. Non-Diversified Fund Risk. The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment. ADR Risk. American Depository Receipts (ADRs) may be subject to certain of the risks associated with direct investments in the securities of foreign companies. ADRs may not track the price of the underlying securities on which they are based, and their value may change materially at times when U.S. markets are not open for trading. Issuer-Specific Changes Risk. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. Cash Transaction (JO:TCPJ) Risk. The Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind. Market Trading Risk. The Fund is subject to numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market, losses from trading in secondary markets, and disruption in the creation/redemption process. During stressed market conditions, Shares may become less liquid as result of deteriorating liquidity which could lead to differences in the market price and the underlying value of those Shares. Tax Risk. To qualify as a regulated investment company ("RIC"), the Fund must meet a qualifying income test each taxable year. Failure to comply with the test would have significant negative tax consequences for shareholders. The Fund believes that income from futures should be treated as qualifying income for purposes of this test, thus qualifying the Fund as a RIC. If the IRS were to determine that the Fund's income is derived from the futures did not constitute qualifying income, the Fund likely would be required to reduce its exposure to such investments in order to maintain its RIC status. Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus/summary prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

Risks of futures contracts include: an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying commodity; possible lack of a liquid secondary market; inability to close a futures contract when desired; losses due to unanticipated market movements; obligation for the Fund to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin; failure to close a position may result in the Fund receiving an illiquid commodity; and unfavorable execution prices. Counterparty Risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party to the contract will not fulfill its contractual obligations, which may cause losses or additional costs. Leverage Risk. Leverage created from borrowing or certain types of transactions or instruments may impair the fund's liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at an unfavorable time or lose more than it invested, increase volatility or otherwise not achieve its intended objective. Cash/Cash Equivalent Risk. To the extent the Fund holds cash or cash equivalents rather than securities or other instruments in which it primarily invests, the Fund risks losing opportunities to participate in market appreciation and may experience potentially lower returns. Collateral Securities Risk. Collateral may include obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, including bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, money market funds and corporate debt securities, such as commercial paper. Although the Fund may hold securities that carry U.S. government guarantees, these guarantees do not extend to shares of the Fund. Money market funds are subject to management fees and other expenses. Therefore, investments in money market funds will cause the Fund to bear indirectly a proportional share of the fees and costs of the money market funds in which it invests. At the same time, the Fund will continue to pay its own management fees and expenses with respect to all of its assets, including any portion invested in the shares of the money market fund. It is possible to lose money by investing in money market funds. Corporate debt securities such as commercial paper generally are short-term unsecured promissory notes issued by businesses. Corporate debt may be rated investment-grade or below investment-grade and may carry variable, or floating, rates of interest. Corporate debt securities carry both credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk is the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer of a corporate debt security is unable to pay interest or repay principal when it is due. Some corporate debt securities that are rated below investment-grade generally are considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss, including default, than higher quality debt securities. U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations issued by US Government agencies and instrumentalities may receive varying levels of support from the government, which could affect the fund's ability to recover should they default. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. Portfolio Size Risk. The Fund typically will hold a small number of positions. To the extent that a significant portion of the Fund's total assets is invested in a limited number of holdings, the appreciation or depreciation of any one position may have a greater impact on the Fund's NAV than it would if the Fund held a greater number of constituents. Non-Diversified Fund Risk. The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment. ADR Risk. American Depository Receipts (ADRs) may be subject to certain of the risks associated with direct investments in the securities of foreign companies. ADRs may not track the price of the underlying securities on which they are based, and their value may change materially at times when U.S. markets are not open for trading. Issuer-Specific Changes Risk. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. Cash Transaction (JO:TCPJ) Risk. The Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind. Market Trading Risk. The Fund is subject to numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market, losses from trading in secondary markets, and disruption in the creation/redemption process. During stressed market conditions, Shares may become less liquid as result of deteriorating liquidity which could lead to differences in the market price and the underlying value of those Shares. Tax Risk. To qualify as a regulated investment company ("RIC"), the Fund must meet a qualifying income test each taxable year. Failure to comply with the test would have significant negative tax consequences for shareholders. The Fund believes that income from futures should be treated as qualifying income for purposes of this test, thus qualifying the Fund as a RIC. If the IRS were to determine that the Fund's income is derived from the futures did not constitute qualifying income, the Fund likely would be required to reduce its exposure to such investments in order to maintain its RIC status. Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus/summary prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

NA3999500 11/24 Contact: Samantha Brandifino, samantha.brandifino@invesco.com, 332 323-5557 New offerings position Invesco as the provider with the most expansive set of ETF assets that access unique exposures of the groundbreaking companies within Nasdaq Indexes ATLANTA, Dec. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd . (NYSE: NYSE:IVZ), a leading global asset management firm, announced today the expansion of the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to include Invesco Top QQQ ETF (QBIG) and Invesco QQQ Low Volatility ETF (QQLV). The newest additions to the firm's popular family of QQQ strategies further positions the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as the most expansive set of ETFs, by assets under management (AUM)1, to offer unique and varied exposures to the innovative companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index ®. "We're excited that the longstanding partnership between Nasdaq and Invesco continues to result in the launch of unique, innovative ETFs, positioning Invesco as the leading provider of Nasdaq-100 ETFs1," says Brian Hartigan, Invesco's Global Head of ETFs & Index Investments. "QBIG and QQLV will offer investors additional ways to access to the Nasdaq Indexes that meet their desired investment outcomes. These ETFs further advance the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as a 'one stop shop' for innovation that offers investors a range of differentiated ETFs." The ETFs offer different exposures to the Nasdaq-100 Index, giving investors an opportunity to either access high beta or low beta versions of the Nasdaq-100 Index and providing options for both potential greater upside capture or potential downside mitigation. The two strategies consider the ever-changing economic landscape by giving shareholders two unique exposures to forward-thinking companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index. QBIG is an actively managed ETF that uses a rules-based approach to track the Nasdaq-100 Mega™ Index ®, which captures the top 45% of companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. Invesco believes this approach is the most effective way to gain targeted exposure to innovation through high growth, mega-cap companies. Focusing on the top 45%, rather than specific named companies or a specific number of companies such as the "Magnificent 72," or previously, "FANMAG3" and "FAANG4", allows QBIG to be prepared for any potential shifts that may occur in the mega-cap landscape. QBIG's methodology adjusts on a quarterly basis for the inevitable and continuously evolving fluctuations in the composition of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index over a longer time horizon. QQLV is the first ETF in the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to offer exposure to low volatility companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. The passively managed fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility™ Index ®, which identifies the least volatile companies over the trailing 12 months within the Nasdaq-100 Index, offering investors access to growth companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index determined to have lower volatility. "Invesco and Nasdaq have been breaking new ground together for years, and we are excited to partner on two new additions to the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite," said Emily Spurling, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Index at Nasdaq. "For nearly 40 years, our flagship Nasdaq-100 Index has been the benchmark for innovation, and we are pleased Invesco can offer investors access to the concentrated companies in the Nasdaq-100 Mega Index and low volatility factor captured by the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility Index." With the launch of QBIG and QQLV, investors now have a robust suite of ETFs that access different exposures and strategies of the Nasdaq Indexes. QQLV offers exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index ® in a more conservative style, and could complement QBIG by offering an opportunity to invest in both ends of the Nasdaq-100 Index beta spectrum. QQLV also offers juxtaposition to the concentration risk of holding the largest mega-cap companies of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

An investment cannot be made directly into an index. About Risk: There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Index-based ETFs are not actively managed. Actively managed ETFs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Both index-based and actively managed ETFs are subject to risks similar to stocks, including those related to short selling and margin maintenance. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as information technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. QQLV Investments focused in a particular sector are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. The Fund may become "non-diversified," as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of the Index. Shareholder approval will not be sought when the Fund crosses from diversified to non-diversified status under such circumstances. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not utilize an investing strategy that seeks returns in excess of its Underlying Index. Therefore, the Fund would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from its Underlying Index, even if that security generally is underperforming. QBIG Market Risk. Securities held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations. You should anticipate that the value of the Shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Additionally, natural or environmental disasters, widespread disease or other public health issues, war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, economic crises or other events could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's net asset value ("NAV"). Management Risk. The Fund is subject to management risk because a portion of its assets are actively managed. In managing certain of the Fund's investment sleeves and other portfolio holdings, the Adviser applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment and asset allocation decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these actions will produce the desired results. Index Risk. While a portion of the Fund's portfolio is actively managed, another portion of the Fund's portfolio is designed to track the performance of the Index. In managing this portion of the Fund's portfolio, the portfolio managers will not generally buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the Index, regardless of the performance of that security. If a specific security is removed from the Index, the Fund may be forced to sell such security at an inopportune time or for a price lower than the security's current market value. The Index may not contain the appropriate mix of securities for any particular economic cycle. Equity Risk. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. Swap Agreements Risk. Swaps involve greater risks than direct investments. Swaps are subject to leveraging, liquidity and counterparty risks, and therefore may be difficult to value. Adverse changes in the value or level of the swap can result in gains or losses that are substantially greater than invested, with the potential for unlimited loss. Industry Concentration Risk. Investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Technology Industry Risk. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than traditional investments and are subject to market, interest rate, credit, leverage, counterparty and management risks. An investment in a derivative could lose more than the cash amount invested. Futures Contracts Risk. Risks of futures contracts include: an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying commodity; possible lack of a liquid secondary market; inability to close a futures contract when desired; losses due to unanticipated market movements; obligation for the Fund to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin; failure to close a position may result in the Fund receiving an illiquid commodity; and unfavorable execution prices. Counterparty Risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party to the contract will not fulfill its contractual obligations, which may cause losses or additional costs. Leverage Risk. Leverage created from borrowing or certain types of transactions or instruments may impair the fund's liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at an unfavorable time or lose more than it invested, increase volatility or otherwise not achieve its intended objective. Cash/Cash Equivalent Risk. To the extent the Fund holds cash or cash equivalents rather than securities or other instruments in which it primarily invests, the Fund risks losing opportunities to participate in market appreciation and may experience potentially lower returns. Collateral Securities Risk. Collateral may include obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, including bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, money market funds and corporate debt securities, such as commercial paper. Although the Fund may hold securities that carry U.S. government guarantees, these guarantees do not extend to shares of the Fund. Money market funds are subject to management fees and other expenses. Therefore, investments in money market funds will cause the Fund to bear indirectly a proportional share of the fees and costs of the money market funds in which it invests.

Title: Lilly's Zepbound is 'superior' compared to rival weight loss drug Wegovy
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-eli-lilly-novo-study-1851713102
Time Published: 2024-12-04T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Zepbound is the “superior” choice for people looking to shed a few pounds, at least compared to Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.19%) Wegovy, according to Eli Lilly (LLY-2.49%). On Wednesday, the Indiana-based pharmaceutical firm released the topline results of a head-to-head clinical trial that it funded, which Lilly says is the first randomized, controlled clinical trial that compares the two weight loss drugs. According to Lilly, which sells both Zepbound and Mounjaro, patients who received weekly shots of Zepbound lost an average of 20.2% of their body weight, or 50 pounds, after 72 weeks. Patients who took shots of Wegovy each week lost an average of 13.7% of their body weight during that period. More than 31% of the people taking Zepbound reported at least 25% body weight loss, compared to just 16.1% of the patients who took Wegovy. Overall, Lilly said, Zepbound provided 47% more weight loss than Wegovy. “We are thrilled that today’s findings showed the superior weight loss of Zepbound, which helped patients achieve 47% more relative weight loss compared to Wegovy,” Leonard C. Glass, senior vice president of global medical affairs at Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in a statement. The trial results were based on tests of a randomized sample of 751 adults across the U.S., including Puerto Rico, who received the maximum tolerated dose of each drug. Each of the participants was either overweight or obese. The most commonly reported side effects were gastrointestinal-related. The topline results were announced in a press release and haven’t yet been made available for peer review. Lilly said it will continue to evaluate its results before publishing them in a peer-reviewed journal and presenting them at a medical meeting in 2025. Although past studies have demonstrated that Zepbound performed better than Wegovy, Lilly’s trial is the first to compare them side-by-side rather than relying on previously published data. It may lead to greater demand for Zepbound, which was first added to the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list back in April. Both Zepbound and Mounjaro were taken off that list in October. The rise of GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, has been a major booster for Lilly and Novo Nordisk, making them the most valuable pharma companies in the world. A number of cheaper, off-brand versions have also made it to market as demand remains high for ways to lose weight.

The shares were up 22%. The data storage management company topped Wall Street's estimates and offered up strong fourth-quarter guidance. Pure Storage also upped its previously forecasted full-year outlook. "We're very pleased," CEO Charles Giancarlo told CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime" on Tuesday. "This is the first time ever where a hyperscaler, for their standard customer-facing storage, is going to be using a system vendor ... and what we're providing them is a very cost effective, high performance solution that can replace 90% of their storage." Pure Storage refrained from sharing the name of the contracted hyperscaler company, but Wall Street analysts regarded news as a big win contributing to the post-earnings pop. A hyperscaler refers to the major cloud computing companies with massive data center that can rapidly size up to meet shifting storage and demands. Some of the key players with major cloud units include Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. Piper Sandler upgraded shares to an overweight rating following the results. Shares are already up about 50% this year as investors seek out alternative methods to playing artificial intelligence trends and companies search for new ways to manage AI's data-heavy needs. Analyst James Fish said the contract creates a "pure opportunity ahead" and "removes the "coinflip risk" previously price into the stock. Agreements with additional hyperscalers represent and additional potential upside catalyst for the stock, he wrote, moving to a $76 price target. "Hyperscaler interest in flash creates a secular tailwind for the space, as these vendors have historically represented 60-70% of [hard disk drive] shipments," wrote James Fish. "AI throws 'gas on the fire' for utilizing" its storage operating system. Fish isn't alone in his bullish take on the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson called the news a "margin accretive" win for the company and upped his price target to $75. "We see no reason to shift our constructive view on PSTG, given the promising incremental revenue opportunity and our continued belief that PSTG offers a superior enterprise storage solution," he wrote.

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Next year promises to be an important one for Intel stock. Intel is likely to see its bread-and-butter CPU sales pick up with a more compelling portfolio of products and recovery in demand. Meanwhile, the company’s foundry business also faces a moment of truth of sorts, as it looks to commercialize its cutting-edge 18A process. And with Donald Trump back in the White House next year, Intel’s sizable base of U.S. manufacturing could put the company in a unique position of strength, given the pro-American policies of the new administration. Below, we take a look at what to expect from Intel in 2025. See our Intel upside analysis on How Intel Stock Can Surge 3x To $60. On the other hand, see our counter scenario which explores how Intel Stock Could Dive To $10. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what are some of the factors that could help Intel stock rebound? In a completely separate, shocking recent development with UnitedHealthcare’s CEO shot in Manhattan this week, see What’s Next For UNH Stock? Intel has lost considerable ground in the CPU market in recent years. While rival AMD has been gaining share, the broader pivot to AI accelerators is also hurting demand for the company’s GPUs. However, Intel’s latest lineup looks more promising. The Lunar Lake chip designed for laptops and ultra-compact devices as well as the Arrow Lake chip for desktops, are manufactured by TSMC using its advanced 3nm process. This could give the company a better shot at competing with AMD in the near term. The broader recovery of the PC market, coupled with stronger products, is likely to help Intel boost Intel revenues in 2024. Moreover, after close to two years of massive investments in AI chip data, companies could begin to boost CPU spending led by general-purpose workloads and server refresh cycles. Intel’s latest server chips, such as the Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids are also expected to compete more favorably with AMD, using the new 3 nanometers “Intel 3” process node. Intel’s revenue guidance for Q4 was also better than expected, with the company projecting sales of between $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, indicating that we could begin to see some of these trends play out. Separately, see What’s Happening With Bitcoin Miner MARA Stock? Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with enterprise-scale production to begin thereafter. If Intel executes this transition effectively, it could shift the narrative around the stock, justifying the significant investments made in its foundry business over the past few years. A Trump Boost For Intel’s FoundryPresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing might be viewed as contributing to protecting U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. This means that the company’s domestic chip supply chain could help it win more contracts under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Although Nvidia remains the undisputed leader in the AI market at the moment, with AMD coming in a distant second, Intel is expanding its presence in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. We believe that this is an opportunity for the likes of Intel to gain some ground. The AI market at large could gradually shift from the process of model training to inferencing, which is the process of generating outputs and answers from trained models. The process of inferencing is less computationally intensive, and it’s possible that these tasks can be handled adequately well by AI processors from the likes of Intel and AMD. Costs are also becoming a concern for end customers of AI chips. The economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenues and there’s a real possibility that from 2025, companies could be a lot more circumspect with their AI spending. Although Gaudi sales have been lackluster, Intel’s newest Gaudi 3 accelerator costs about half as much as Nvidia’s chips, and this could make for a more favorable price-to-performance tradeoff. The shift toward inferencing is a key reason to consider Selling Nvidia, Buying AMD Stock. Intel stock trades at about $24 per share currently or 25x consensus 2025 earnings, which is reasonable in our view given the above factors. Intel is also expected to return to growth next year with consensus pointing to about 6% revenue expansion. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, slightly ahead of the current market price.

Title: Cushman & Wakefield’s Joanne Podell Explains Retail’s Dramatic Changes

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy With 25 years of experience and retail deals the scale of which would make an office broker’s eyes pop, there are few better to ask about the state of today’s brick-and-mortar leasing environment than Joanne Podell. The executive vice chair for retail services at Cushman & Wakefield (CWK) sat down with Commercial Observer shortly before Thanksgiving to talk about all the travails the industry has been through in the last several years, putting into perspective the ups and downs that have taken place and pointing out that it’s a good time to be a retail broker. Some of Podell’s biggest clients include TD Bank, which she assisted in its expansion in the New York City market by adding over 50 new locations, as well as Nike when in 2016 Podell negotiated a 70,000-square-foot lease for its flagship at 650 Fifth Avenue. Most recently, Podell (pronounced “Poh-DELL”) helped Chinese retailer Miniso in its New York City expansion with a 5,000-square-foot deal at 150 Broadway in June. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: Is the retail apocalypse officially over? Joanne Podell: I think there never was one. What a terrible word, and there’s so many circumstances around it that we have to consider. I mean, the world fell apart, so retail is just a part of everything else that was happening — theater, tourism. It was a terrible confluence of lots of different things. Thrown in there was everybody shopping online, and how is that going to affect everything? From the beginning, the National Retail Federation and people like me were saying, “Yeah, e-commerce will definitely take some of the retail business, but also enhance the retail business.” Because people go online, they look at what they like, and some of them want to just go into a store and take a look at it, right? Then there’s what they call the halo effect of retail that goes online, where people walk into a store, they shop around, they go home, and they order something online. So, you know, it’s amorphous. It’s very hard to just define it the way that “apocalypse” was used. That was silly. Who were the retailers who survived it and why? The ones that struggled the most and still do are because of the office. Most affected were those in food and beverage, obviously, because people are in the office three or four days instead of five. But if a woman wants a coat, she’s an office worker, she’s in New York, then she’s going to shop Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday for the coat, right? It’s not like she’s never going to buy it. So I think F&B was hurt. But every restaurant is packed all the time, and the bars are packed all the time. So F&B is back. It seems like when it comes to F&B, when one restaurant closes, another opens quickly in its place? It’s usually the second or third generation of the restaurant that ends up making it, and that’s unfortunate. And the reason is the costs to build out, and get the licensing and permitting, are just prohibitive. So the guy that gets the space the next, he’s got all of that in place. That’s why second-generation restaurants lease very quickly, because oftentimes the equipment is there. If it’s not, all the fittings are there. And so it’s an easy transition for the second or third restaurant. That’s too bad, because some of these poor guys, they put their heart and soul, their savings, into building something, and then the next guy gets the benefit. Tell us about some of your more interesting recent deals. My business has changed a little bit. We were doing a lot of flagships, and so that’s a great business, but now it seems like we have a steady flow of a variety of deals. We represent Miniso out of China, and we’re building a portfolio for them slowly. They had considered doing a flagship, and they said, “You know what? That’s not the direction we want to go.” We represent Citizens Bank. We’re very carefully looking at their portfolio and where they need to move if their leases are up or if they need to stay where they are. Luxottica, we represented them, it was filling in where they were missing stores. So it continues to be the steady flow of the retailers that we work with. We also represent landlords, and I actually love the balance of representing a landlord and a tenant. You get a much better perspective of the market. You see what landlords are willing to do, how they feel that they can create deals and get them done. It’s a good part of the business, so we do that as well. A lot of the recent buyers of New York retail properties are foreign buyers. Why is that? You stabilize what your rent is going to be from a retailer’s point of view. Here’s a negative and why people never bought: It’s because your program changes. For the first couple of years, you’re an apparel store, you include shoes and handbags, right? Then you figure out, “I’m not getting an ROI on that as much as I should. What do I need that big of a store for? I’ll streamline my store 20 percent, I’ll pay less rent. I’m going to do fine.” So they don’t buy, they lease, so they have that flexibility. Not the same when you buy, but when you buy — and you’re a conglomerate, you can buy a building — you could break it up for multiple tenants. Kering’s purchase of 715-717 Fifth Avenue, right? They have 13 brands, so they’re in a position where if one brand doesn’t work, they’ll put another brand in. But single-brand ownership doesn’t make any sense at all. So it’s very unique that they buy. Are foreign buyers leasing space too, or are they just buying? There’s tremendous interest, but they’re not just buying, they’re coming again to lease. The foreign companies are coming back — particularly the Chinese companies. We have another company that’s coming in, too. They’re here already and they’re going to expand in a more significant way. I can’t tell you the name yet. China is becoming an interesting place to look for retail. One of the things that hurt retail after the pandemic was that the Chinese investors and tourists did not come back quickly. Are tenant-owners expanding outside of New York? They have to grow their business. That’s their job. If they don’t, it tanks their stock. So they’re out there making, hopefully, very good decisions on expansion, and that’s a great thing, because all of that leads to more jobs, more manufacturing, hopefully some of it in the U.S. The malls, very competitive. We are working on getting space for Miniso in some of the local malls, and there is tremendous competition for space. Look at the investment from American companies in retail. Look at Acadia. They’re a great company. They’re buying a lot of retail. Empire State Realty Trust — for years, you never heard about them buying retail, it was really about maintaining and redoing the Empire State Building and maintaining a very strong office portfolio. They just bought a bunch of retail property in Williamsburg. Are there any neighborhoods that haven’t bounced back? The city is so strong, I would give you an answer if I knew one. I don’t know what’s not bouncing back. It seems like it’s hard to find good space in most residential markets, and certainly you look at Flatiron, SoHo — very strong. Financial District, Downtown — good activity there as well. Can we finally stop talking about experiential retail? Many years ago, department stores had makeup departments, right? And we’re talking about 25 years ago. You would go in there, and a woman behind the counter would say, “Try this lipstick.” What is that? That is and always was experiential retail. If you want to take it all the way to the other side, Nike with a basketball court, sure, very nice. But is it critical, or that important? No. I think a good product, good inventory, good service — those are the things that make retail successful, and understanding who your customer is, which probably is the No. 1 thing to mention. There’s been a big culling of retail brokers in the last few years. What are the effects of that on the market? I don’t know that there were layoffs, as this is a very hard business. It takes a long time to be good at it, and this is not about ego, because you don’t have to be a genius to be in this business. But it takes perseverance. It takes a willingness to work very hard to be successful. I think the layoffs come from people who recognize that this is not the business for them. It literally can take five years before someone can make a decent living. And you ask any broker, they’re going to tell you the same thing: It takes years to learn this business. And not to disparage other kinds of brokerage, but retail is so unique, the nuances in retail require a different knowledge base. You need to know this market and, as the market changes, you have to recognize the changes in the market. You have to be aware of all the different kinds of tenants that are coming into the market, and then you need to work hard and build relationships. When I started, I worked seven days a week. I walked the streets, I met lots of other brokers like myself. That’s a very different thing than other kinds of businesses. How can a young broker get their foot in the door? It really depends on the mindset of the broker. Do they want to work by themselves and maybe represent a few people? For me, I could never do the job well if I didn’t have a big team — we do a lot of work in terms of providing information. You know, information is king. It’s not acceptable or viable for a tenant or a landlord to make a decision without knowing what’s going on in the market, what else is available, and the types of companies that are out there. How am I going to know all that? Every senior broker has a different perspective, so I can only speak for myself. I don’t want anybody coming to work knowing they’re not going to walk away with $1 at the end of the day. So, for me, I’d rather make sure that my guys have a salary of some kind or a draw. I think it’s important. I’m not talking about getting them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but you’ve got to do that. It’s also your obligation as a senior broker, someone who’s been in the business a long time, you got to train these people. You got to teach them. They have to learn. They have to be part of your life, they have to be in your office, listening to conversations, learning about negotiation. All those things take time. What does it mean for the brokers who survived the last eight years or so? I think that if you’re hardworking and you like what you do, you can be great at it. It’s just your commitment. What role does data play for you? I love information. I love data. I think 20-something years ago, I think I was one of the first people to hire someone with a clicker to count how many people walked in front of a store. I desperately believe that without data, you can’t do a good job. You can’t provide enough information to your client. At the end of the day, I always tell people the same thing: It’s intuition and information. You need the historical information of that neighborhood. You can get specific information, but the nuances of the neighborhood — that street is always too dark or that one tenant that’s been there forever is really never leaving. The things that don’t show up in Placer.ai data come from you being on the street and understanding it. As for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the market there still going to continue in the direction it’s been heading for the last 10 years or so? ESRT just invested a lot of money there. Acadia owns property there, right? It’s a good trading area. And I think as long as the rents stay realistic, you’ve got a good demographic. What are rents like compared to before the pandemic? In some cases, we’re almost back. In some cases, it is over. Certain neighborhoods are stable. Because there’s no particular new growth, tenants can only pay so much. There’s no new development that would cause everybody to say, “Oh my god, there’s going to be additional traffic coming there, right?” So they stay pretty much the same. Flatiron, those rents came back so quickly, but they are all stable because of the same thing. One of the problems that we had historically, which we certainly had a number of years ago, was places like Flatiron got just too expensive. You need tenants to stay in business. It’s not a good look for people to go out of business because they can’t afford the rent. That’s probably my biggest concern. I know it’s counterintuitive, because brokers get paid on bigger deals, but I want people to stay in business. Now people need security, that’s tough. Theft is at a higher number than it was before. So those are the challenges that we have. Organized retail theft has been a problem for several years now. Do you think the situation is improving? I think 34th Street looks much better. There was a good amount of time after the pandemic when it was just awful. I think the business improvement district, they’ve done an amazing job. Look, I don’t want to be political, but I can tell you that it appears to me that it looks better. Fifth Avenue — recently I saw some poor families there, but I’m not seeing what I used to see. What do you think of some of the chains like Foot Locker, Red Lobster and Blink Fitness filing for bankruptcy? There’s always bankruptcy. That’s normal. Some people make good decisions and commit the right amount of money to growth and to development, and they can outlive their competition. Jeff Bezos said this and I totally believe it: Everybody will go bankrupt at some point, including Amazon. Now to the casino in Times Square — what do you think of that? Is it good or is it bad? I think if there is going to be a casino, it should be there. I think it’s the right place and I understand the challenges to the office market, and I recognize that we have to increase security for it. There’s a lot that has to be done to make it work. But the amount of revenue that would come from it would be just crazy. And the city could use it. It’d be a lot better than charging $9 for people to drive into Manhattan below 60th Street. People are afraid. There are beautiful office buildings there, and I guess the folks in the office buildings are a little concerned, but I don’t think they should be. With the right amount of police and sanitation, I think it could be a boon for New York. I’ve been going to ICSC Las Vegas every year for about 30 years, and I’ve never put a quarter in a machine. Some people are gamblers, and they enjoy it, and that’s fine, and some people just don’t find it interesting. I don’t think the whole world is going to turn to gambling just because they open a casino. Mark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com.

This growth will be fuelled by third-party cargo growth at new terminals over FY24-27E, followed by robust growth in JSW Group traffic FY27E onwards. This is based only on announced projects and there is significant optionality of new concessions given a) GoI’s aggressive port privatisation targets, b) management’s opportunistic approach, and c) its robust balance sheet. With a long residual concession life and strong growth visibility (given expansion plans of JSW Group), JSW Infra’s prem valuations look justified to us. Initiate with BUY rating. Initiate at BUY. JSW Infra’s FY27E val multiples prima facie look rich, at a premium to peers (Fig 49). We think this is justified given a) the significantly longer concession period, b) growth underpinned by expansions planned by group cos (esp post FY27E). We ascribe 18x to FY30E EBITDA and discount it back to arrive at our TP of Rs370/sh. Initiate with BUY. Pricol Ltd (Pricol): SACL Acquisition - growth at right valuations - Company Update CMP: Rs496; TP: Rs645; Rating: BUY ~ We raise our TP on Pricol to Rs645 (previously Rs580), as we account for earnings from the recent Sundaram Auto Components Ltd (SACL) acquisition and reiterate BUY. ~ This acquisition enables Pricol to focus on injection molding as a new vertical and has tremendous growth potential by virtue of new customer additions, courtesy well-established relationships in the legacy business. ~ We believe that the acquisition valuation (~12x FY24 PE ratio) is justified, given the presence of fast growing TVS Limited, relatively lower margins and its propulsion agnostic products. ~ The acquisition has led to an upgrade in the pre-acquisition earnings by 10% each in FY26/27E. ~ With 2w contributing ~65% to Pricol’s total revenues, robust demand in 2Ws presents a favorable outlook for the company to clock volume growth supported by a new portfolio of plastic components along with premiumization.
