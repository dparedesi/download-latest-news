Title: Analyst Unveils Crypto Catalysts for ‘Jubilant July,’ Says Altcoins Will Likely ‘Cook’ for Next Few Weeks

A crypto strategist with a history of timely Bitcoin (BTC) calls believes that the digital asset market will flourish this month. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. “It’s the start of a new quarter and a new month. It’s also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let’s also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.” As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. “If you’re bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.” Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he’s keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. “I do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like… sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week’s lows as a point we shouldn’t lose on most of these… I think we see others play out something like drawn below.” At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.

Title: Recently vandalized UK warplanes are foreign assets – ex-envoy to RT (VIDEO)

The Royal Air Force warplanes defaced by pro-Palestinian activists last month are owned not by the British government but a US hedge fund, prominent human-rights activist Craig Murray has alleged. He added that at least some of the planes appear to be routinely leased out to the Israeli military. In June, several activists from the group Palestine Action broke into Brize Norton, the UK’s largest airbase, and sprayed red paint into the turbines of two Voyager aircraft before fleeing the scene undetected. The group said the stunt was a protest against the supposed involvement of the Royal Air Force in Israel’s military operation in Gaza. The British authorities vowed to prosecute those responsible. Speaking to RT on Sunday, Murray, who served as British ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002 till 2004 and is an associate of WikiLeaks’ co-founder Julian Assange, said that he had discovered that the planes in question were owned by Airtanker Ltd, which, in turn, is supposedly “owned by a string of seven fake companies.” According to Murray, behind the cutout entities stands a US hedge fund named Polygon Global Partners LLP, which is the real owner of the planes. He claimed that the entity “has joint interests with the Trump organization and BlackRock,” which has stakes in several military industrial giants. The former British diplomat told RT that of the 14 planes in question “nine are permanently with the RAF, and five of them are sometimes with the RAF, and sometimes can be leased out to other foreign militaries, including the Israeli military.” “It seems to be fairly definite that the Israelis are using these planes. These planes have been frequently flying to [the RAF Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus] which has been the main military support base for Israeli activities into Gaza,” Murray claimed. He added that officials in London refuse to either confirm or deny that such military missions are carried out in support of Israel. On top of that, according to Murray, the British “taxpayer is being ripped off” as under the contract with Polygon Global, the UK government is “paying five times the value of these planes.” He said the agreement expires in 2049. In the wake of the vandalism, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to designate the activist group as a terrorist organization and ban it.

Title: Talent tug-of-war: Why companies get rattled when stars join rivals

It’s likely to be the latter more often. But the opposite is true, as well: We also believe that the best place to hire from is the competition. Just recently, Meta’s new division — with an eye on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) — announced 11 key hires from arch rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. If reports are to be believed, Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading the hiring campaign by hosting some of the potential hires at his home. This prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to claim that Meta offered $100 million signing bonuses to some of his employees. And Meta isn’t alone. The move echoes industry-wide trends. This year alone, Microsoft spent $650 million acquiring much of Inflection AI’s team while Amazon hired the co-founders of Adept, a start-up developing AI-powered agents. Begs the question whether anti-compete contracts aren’t at play? In a recent case of a software engineer vs his former employer, the Delhi High Court ruled that the non-compete clauses blocking job switches are not enforceable. The court said that Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, clearly says that any agreement that restrains anyone from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business shall be void. A research handbook published by the leading global law firm DLA Piper offers insights into anti-compete laws worldwide. Interestingly, among the 34 major countries they studied, only in five, including India, are the non-compete employment contracts non-enforceable. But, just in case you have forgotten the fine print of your employment contract and want to browse it again, you will find an anti-compete clause glaring at you. Did the MNCs bring their global template to India and were we only too happy to copy and paste it from entry-level jobs to senior leaders, making no distinction between the dictates of the roles and the laws of the land? Cognizant’s hiring of Wipro’s former CFO sparked a legal battle, which eventually got settled after nine months. The current legal proceedings between Cognizant and Infosys, involving allegations of anti-competitive practices in the US healthcare IT market, show that the stakes are high for these enterprises. When firms lose leaders who hold key customer relationships or techies who have the IP to build new-age products or platforms at the competition, the threat is real. This may prompt organisations to protect their interests, which explains the suits. In spite of these potential legal exposures, why do boards still hire CEOs from the competition? The mindset of large enterprises with deep pockets is to ‘buy’ talent, rather than ‘build’ it, since this takes time, and the risks of a potential anti-compete suit are outweighed by the benefits of the hiring. The popular ask from hiring managers is “We want to recruit someone who hits the road running”. When Zomato wanted to boost its live events business, it didn’t promote someone internally— it hired the live events head from BookMyShow and designated him as Founder. Ditto Starbucks — within 17 months of hiring a new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, it replaced him with a leader from Chipotle, and immediately its stock price went up by 20 per cent and has remained steady since. Even the stock market cheers when you hire from the competition. The hypocritical mindset of enterprise culture is hard to miss. We hire our top talent from rivals but internally we berate them on a regular basis to build the competitive spirit in our teams. Whenever we chest-thump about our products, services or employers, we can’t help but reference them against our competitors, and hence it’s emotionally hard to accept anyone amongst us joining a rival. Hence, we resort to practices like ‘garden leave’, immediate relieving, legal threats, and/or holding on to financial dues as a mark of retaliation. All these also send a ‘message’ to colleagues of the consequences of joining the competition. These over-the-top reactions breed a different set of behaviours among team members, who eventually start lying about their health and personal matters when they leave or join friendly employers briefly and eventually join competitors a couple of months later. I agree it’s an uphill task to eliminate the anti-compete clauses we have included in all roles within our enterprises. But can we take a leaf out of Belgium, where non-competition clauses are valid only if the employee earns an annual gross remuneration of at least €78,706? Day in and day out, our leaders talk about the strength of our brands, the legacy of the company, loyal customers, enviable culture, best financial rewards and, not to forget, the Best Employer certificates that we keep flashing. However, our employment contracts don’t reflect the same spirit that we find on our office posters. Are enterprises built with such weak foundations that one leadership movement to the competition can bring them down? What’s the fear? When sports clubs and premier leagues allow players to be bought and compete against the club where they were trained at, why not enterprises?

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (IBIT) Just Two Spots Away From Being Firm’s Top Revenue-Generating ETF: Bloomberg Analyst

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is already generating substantial revenue for the world’s largest asset manager, despite being on the market for less than two years. In a new post on the social media platform X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas says that IBIT needs to grow its fund’s assets by less than $10 billion to rank as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating exchange-traded fund (ETF). “IBIT is now the third-highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9 billion away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF. Here’s the top 10 list for BlackRock (aside, how about the forgettable IWF at the top spot, who knew?).” Based on the analyst’s data, BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) ETF is already producing an estimated revenue of $191 million per year at $76.314 billion in fund assets while charging 25 basis points annually to investors. Balchunas appears to posit that if the net assets of the fund grow by $9 billion, IBIT will produce an annual revenue of about $213 million, enough to surpass the revenue generated by IWF. BlackRock’s IWF or iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF offers exposure to US firms whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has been around since May 2000 and is generating $211 million in yearly revenue, charging 19 basis points per year to investors. Meanwhile, the firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) – which gives investors exposure to a broad range of equities trading in the European, Australian, Asian and Far Eastern markets – was launched in 2001 and is generating $207 million in revenue annually with an expense ratio of 0.32%. As of Thursday’s close, IBIT is trading at $62.19.

Title: New UN report reveals the companies getting rich off Israeli occupation and genocide
URL: https://mondoweiss.net/2025/07/new-un-report-reveals-the-companies-getting-rich-off-israeli-occupation-and-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, issued a seminal report on June 30, titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide.” It focuses on the economic interests benefiting from the current genocide in Gaza. While the report itself names a lot of names, from states to corporations, banks, and universities, Albanese concludes, “the entities named in the present report constitute a fraction of a much deeper structure of corporate involvement, profiteering from and enabling violations and crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory.” The report comes on the heels of two other major reports by Albanese last year: the “Anatomy of a Genocide” from March 2024 and the “Genocide as Colonial Erasure” in October 2024. In the latter, Albanese identified how Israel was expanding its genocide from Gaza to the West Bank. Her analysis holds that there are three main elements of Israel’s colonialist takeover: displacement, replacement, and erasure. Genocide is the most extreme form of erasure, but it is a part of the larger eliminationist logic within a broader plan of “colonial erasure.” Given her mandate on territories occupied since 1967, that is where Albanese focuses her analysis. The Israeli occupation since 1967 has had broad economic support, particularly from the corporate world, and these actors have mostly continued that support as Israel has moved to its next stage of colonial erasure: Genocide. The focus of this report is to show how corporations have enabled the displacement, replacement, and erasure of Palestinian life, exposing “the integration of the economies of settler-colonial occupation and genocide.” The report finishes with a stirring call to action. In Albanese’s words, “Commercial endeavours enabling and profiting from the obliteration of innocent people’s lives must cease. Corporate entities must refuse to be complicit in human rights violations and international crimes or be held to account.” A post shared by Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@francesca.albanese.unsr.opt) The economic actors facilitating displacement are mostly companies that are involved with heavy equipment, weapons, and tech surveillance. There is a myriad of actors, directly or through subsidiaries. For example, Caterpillar is a well-known example with its deep collaboration with Israeli weapons manufacturers and military: “For decades, Caterpillar Inc. has provided Israel with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes and infrastructure, through both the United States Foreign Military Financing programme and an exclusive licensee requisitioned by Israeli law into the military. In partnership with companies such as Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Leonardo DRS, Inc.-owned RADA Electronic Industries, Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, “neutralizing” the territory and killing Palestinians.” This has placed Caterpillar at the center of genocide in Gaza: “Since October 2023, Caterpillar equipment has been documented as being used to carry out mass demolitions – including of homes, mosques and life-sustaining infrastructure – raid hospitals and burying alive wounded Palestinians. In 2025, Caterpillar secured a further multi-million dollar contract with Israel.” But there are many other examples in this industry as well: “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to the destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers. Volvo’s licensee is an OHCHR database-listed company [UN database lists business enterprises that have “directly and indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the settlements”] and together they own Merkavim Transportation Technologies Ltd., which produces armoured buses sold to service colonies. Since at least 2007, Volvo machinery has been used to raze Palestinian areas, including in East Jerusalem and Masafer Yatta. For over a decade, HD Hyundai machinery has been used to demolish Palestinian homes and raze farmland, including olive groves.” And these become tools of genocide: “After October 2023, Israel increased the use of the equipment of those companies in the urban destruction of Gaza, including in flattening Rafah and Jabalia, after which the military obscured their logos.” Military tech surveillance is a big part of the Israeli colonialist displacement regime. Israeli companies such as the NSO Group have built a global market for their surveillance technology, but the report also names several well-known international corporations and outlines their roles in supporting Palestinian displacement. These include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Palantir. Once Israel displaces Palestinians, a wide array of businesses support the consolidation of its control through the creation and maintenance of Israeli colonies: construction, raw materials (often pillaged from occupied territory), agribusiness, tourism, etc. Here, there are also many international actors that facilitate the normalization of Israel’s displacement and theft: “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory. In 2024, this intensified after the administration of colonies moved from the military to the civilian Government and the Ministry of Construction and Housing budget doubled, with $200 million allotted for colony construction. From November 2023 to October 2024, Israel established 57 new colonies and outposts, with Israeli and international companies supplying machinery, raw materials and logistical support”. While the same heavy machinery providers reappear (Caterpillar, HD Hyundai, Volvo), other actors provide raw materials: “The German Heidelberg Materials AG, through its subsidiary Hanson Israel, has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank. In 2018, Hanson Israel won a public tender to supply materials from that quarry for colony construction, and has since nearly exhausted the quarry, prompting ongoing expansion requests.” Transport: “Various companies contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians. The Spanish/Basque Construcciones Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles joined a consortium with a OHCHR database-listed company to maintain and expand the Jerusalem Light Rail Red Line and build the new Green Line, at a time when other companies had withdrawn owing to international pressure. These lines include 27 kilometres of new tracks and 50 new stations in the West Bank, connecting colonies with West Jerusalem. Doosan and Volvo excavators and machinery have been used, and Heidelberg’s subsidiary supplied materials for a light-rail bridge.” Real estate: “Real estate companies sell properties in colonies to Israeli and international buyers. The global real estate group, Keller Williams Realty LLC, through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel, has had branches based in the colonies. In March 2024, Keller Williams, through another franchisee, Home in Israel, ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” And then there is “occupation tourism”, which brings in the online services, Booking.com and Airbnb: “Major online travel platforms, used by millions to reserve accommodation, profit from the occupation by selling tourism that sustains the colonies, excludes Palestinians, promotes settler narratives and legitimizes annexation. Booking Holdings Inc. and Airbnb, Inc. list properties and hotel rooms in Israeli colonies. Booking.com has more than doubled its listings in the West Bank – from 26 in 2018 to 70 by May 2023 – and tripled its East Jerusalem listings to 39 in the year post October 2023. Airbnb has also amplified its colonial profiteering, growing from 139 listings in 2016 to 350 in 2025, collecting up to 23 per cent commission. These listings are linked with restricting Palestinian access to land and endangering nearby villages. In Tekoa, Airbnb enables settler promotion of a “warm and loving community”, whitewashing settler violence against the neighbouring Palestinian village of Tuqu‘.” There is an entire interconnected network of companies, institutions, and interests that weave together to support and profit from the Israeli occupation. The entities are all enabling Israel’s illegality, and Albanese breaks them down by sector. War crimes and crimes against humanity are a risky business in general. Investing in a country that creates so much turmoil is counterintuitive for many, and many investors have bailed out of the high-tech industry, for example. That’s why financial giants are important to secure that investments in the war machine keep flowing. Albanese explains how the world’s largest banks give Israel financial cover as it carries out genocide. Albanese: “Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms – including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) – were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them. Meanwhile, the Development Corporation for Israel (i.e., Israel Bonds) provides a bond solicitation service for the Government of Israel for overseas private individuals and other investors. The Development Corporation for Israel tripled its annual bond sales to funnel nearly $5 billion to Israel since October 2023, while offering investors the option of sending the return on bond investments to charitable organizations supporting the Israeli military and the colonies.” Insurance companies then buttress this: “Global insurance companies, including [German] Allianz and AXA, also invest large sums in shares and bonds implicated in the occupation and genocide, partly as capital reserves for policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but primarily to generate returns. Allianz holds at least $7.3 billion and AXA, despite some divestment decisions, still invests at least $4.09 billion in tracked companies named in the present report. Their insurance policies also underwrite the risks other companies necessarily take when operating in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, thus enabling the commission of human rights abuses and “de-risking” the operational environment.” And pension funds are involved in this too, including Norwegian and Canadian ones: “Sovereign wealth and pension funds are also significant financiers. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, claims it has the world’s most comprehensive ethical guidelines. After October 2023, the Fund increased its investment in Israeli companies by 32 per cent to $1.9 billion. By the end of 2024, the Fund had $121.5 billion – 6.9 per cent of its total value – invested in companies named in the present report alone. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which manages Can$ 473.3 billion ($328.9 billion) in pension funds for six million Canadians, has almost Can$ 9.6 billion ($6.67 billion) invested in companies named in the present report, despite its sustainable investment policy and human rights policy. From 2023 to 2024, it almost tripled investment in Lockheed Martin, quadrupled investment in Caterpillar and increased 10-fold the investment in HD Hyundai.” But the enablers are not just financial institutions. Albanese shows how academia has also played a crucial role. The most prestigious academic institutions are tied to Israel. Like MIT: “Leading universities, especially from global-minority countries, partner with Israeli institutions in areas directly harming Palestinians. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, labs conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense – the only foreign military financing research at the Institute. Notable Israeli Ministry of Defense projects include drone swarm control – a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 – pursuit algorithms and underwater surveillance. From 2019 to 2024, the Institute managed a Lockheed Martin seed fund connecting students to teams in Israel. From 2017 to 2025, Elbit Systems paid for membership to the Institute’s Industrial Liaison Program, enabling access to research and talent.” Huge EU academic projects are involved: “The European Commission’s Horizon Europe programme actively facilitates collaboration with Israeli institutions, including those complicit in apartheid and genocide. Since 2014, the European Commission has granted over €2.12 billion ($2.4 billion) to Israeli entities, including the Ministry of Defense, while European academic institutions both benefit from and reinforce this entanglement. The Technical University of Munich receives €198.5 million ($218 million) in EC Horizon funding, including €11.47 million ($12.6 million) for 22 collaborations with Israeli partners, military and tech firms. The University and Israel Aerospace Industries receive €792,795.75 ($868,416) to jointly develop, with other participants, green hydrogen refuelling, technology relevant to Israel Aerospace Industries military drones used in Gaza. The University partners with IBM Israel – which runs the discriminatory Israeli Population Registry – on cloud and artificial intelligence systems, as part of the €7.75 million ($8.52 million) IBM Israel receives in Horizon funding. The University also collaborates on a €10.76 million ($11.71 million) project on “seamless shared urban mobility” that includes the Municipality of Jerusalem, a city entrenching annexation through urban transportation.” Agribusiness has often been seen as a trademark of Israel’s innovation, but it is inextricably connected to Israel’s occupation. “Agribusiness has thrived on Israel-led extractivism and land-grabbing – producing goods and technologies serving Israeli settler-colonial interests, expanding market dominance and attracting global investment – while erasing Palestinian food systems and accelerating displacement,” Albanese writes. She names the Israeli food giant Tnuva, and the watering giant Netafim: “Tnuva, the largest food conglomerate in Israel, now majority-owned by the Chinese Bright Food (Group) Co., Ltd., has fueled and benefited from land dispossession. Tnuva’s Chairman recognized that “agriculture … in general and dairy farming in particular are a strategic resource and a significant pillar in the settlement enterprise”. Israel has used kibbutzim and agricultural outposts to seize Palestinian land and replace Palestinians. Companies like Tnuva help by sourcing products from these colonies, then exploit the resulting captive Palestinian market to build market dominance… Netafim, a global leader in drip irrigation technology, now 80 per cent owned by the Mexican company Orbia Advance Corporation, has designed its agritech in concert with the expansion imperatives of Israel. While maintaining a global image of sustainability, Netafim technology has enabled intensive exploitation of water and land in the West Bank, further depleting Palestinian natural resources, while being refined through collaboration with Israeli military-technology firms. In the Jordan Valley, Netafim-aided irrigation systems have facilitated Israeli crop expansion, while Palestinian farmers – denied water and with 93 per cent unirrigated land – are pushed out, unable to compete with Israeli production. Furthermore, such irrigation techniques threaten to exhaust the Jordan River and Dead Sea.” Shipping giants like the Danish Mærsk then ship the goods: “Global logistics giants like A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S are integral to this ecosystem; for years they have shipped goods from the colonies and OHCHR database-listed companies straight to the United States and other markets.” And Mærsk is involved in much more than just shipping avocados: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” Those who supply Israel with energy, inevitably supply what Israel is doing – not just its colonization, but also its genocide. A lot of world actors are involved here: “Coal for electricity to Israel originates primarily from Colombia (60 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023-24); United States-headquartered Drummond Company, Inc. and the Swiss-based Glencore PLC are the primary suppliers. Their respective subsidiaries own the mines and the three ports involved in the delivery of 15 coal shipments to Israel since October 2023, including six shipments after Colombia suspended coal exports to Israel in August 2024. Glencore was also involved in shipments from South Africa; these shipments accounted for 15 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023 and 2024.” This is taking place while Israel pillages Palestinian natural resources: “The United States Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMed Energy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan. The Gaza naval blockade is connected to Israel securing the Tamar gas supply and the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline. At a time of increasing brutality, the British company BP PLC is expanding involvement in the Israeli economy, with exploration licences confirmed in March 2025, which allow BP to explore Palestinian maritime expanses illegally exploited by Israel.” While all these sectors of industry help contribute to and enable the Israeli occupation in one way or another, it cannot be forgotten that the Israeli military and weapons industry are a primary vehicle for and beneficiary of Israel’s military aggression and genocide. Albanese naturally has a section focused on the military sector, titled “Military sector – the business of elimination,” which shows how its military industry serves a major national and international economic interest. Albanese explains: “The military-industrial complex has become the economic backbone of the State. Between 2020 and 2024, Israel was the eighth-largest arms exporter worldwide. The two most prominent Israeli weapons companies – Elbit Systems, established as a public-private partnership and later privatized, and State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries – are among the top 50 arms manufacturers globally.” And there’s the cooperation with the U.S., which has culminated in the F-35 jet program, a massive international effort: “Israel benefits from the largest-ever defence procurement programme – for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin, alongside at least 1,650 other companies, including Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A, and eight States… Post-October 2023, F-35s and F-16s have been integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” There are also the Elbit drones, which is also the product of international collaboration: “Suppliers such as the Japanese FANUC Corporation provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin”. And shipping, of course, so once again Mærsk: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” So while there is the raw military industry, which people obviously associate with the worst of the attacks against Palestinians – but there is so much more to Israel’s apparatus of control over Palestine and Palestinians. It is so enormous and so globally interconnected that it would be hard to find a person in this world who doesn’t know at least one of the corporations involved. Albanese concludes with her recommendations for states, corporations, the ICC, and the UN. For corporations, this is to “cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international crimes against the Palestinian people” and to pay reparations to the Palestinian people. She offers the example of an apartheid wealth tax along the lines of post-apartheid South Africa. For states and international bodies, such as the ICC and UN, Albanese calls on them to enforce the accountability mechanisms at their disposal, not only on Israel, but on the corporations who are enabling its illegal action. In addition, she called on states to impose sanctions and a full arms embargo on Israel. And then finally, she has a call to action for us in civil society: “The Special Rapporteur urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can end these unspeakable crimes.” Albanese outlines a worldwide network of collaboration that enables Israel’s genocide in one way or another. It is overwhelming to consider, and some may be daunted by its enormity, but it is not an invincible system. It operates on elements that are very mundane: resources and money. It is dependent on an economic network and on global consent. And here lies the key to dismantling it. Albanese ends: “The complicity exposed by the report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including its executives. International law recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring scrutiny and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s self-determination and very existence are at stake. This is a necessary step to end the genocide and dismantle the global system that has allowed it.” Jonathan Ofir Jonathan Ofir is an Israeli musician, conductor and writer based in Denmark. You can hear it directly from Francesca Albanese in this 13 minute interview with Chris Hedges: “...the genocide in gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative…” “The Real Reason the Genocide Hasn’t Been Stopped” https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/06/the-real-reason-the-genocide-hasnt-been-stopped-w-francesca-albanese/ And there’s also another reason the genocide has been allowed to continue: the U.S. military is testing the waters to see what the public will tolerate: In the past several years, the Department of Defense has become fixated on how the United States might fight a major war against an enemy that rivals the American military in force and technology. In such a scenario—known as a large-scale combat operation, or L.S.C.O.—combat would take place across land, sea, air, and into the thermosphere. Command of the air could not be taken for granted. Intelligence may be spotty. Casualties could soar into the hundreds of thousands, and whole cities could be flattened. “In short,” Modirzadeh writes, the U.S. military has begun “preparing for an all-out war with China.” And, with such conflagrations burning in the mind, “LSCO lawyers,” as Modirzadeh calls them, have been arguing that the laws of war are far more permissive than many of their peers and the public seem to appreciate. From that vantage, Gaza not only looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat U.S. soldiers may face. It is a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction that such kinds of warfare entail. “What’s Legally Allowed in War…How U.S. military lawyers see Israel’s invasion of Gaza—and the public’s reaction to it—as a dress rehearsal for a potential conflict with a foreign power like China.” https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/whats-legally-allowed-in-war

Title: New UN report reveals the companies getting rich off Israeli occupation and genocide

Full Content:
The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, issued a seminal report on June 30, titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide.” It focuses on the economic interests benefiting from the current genocide in Gaza. While the report itself names a lot of names, from states to corporations, banks, and universities, Albanese concludes, “the entities named in the present report constitute a fraction of a much deeper structure of corporate involvement, profiteering from and enabling violations and crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory.” The report comes on the heels of two other major reports by Albanese last year: the “Anatomy of a Genocide” from March 2024 and the “Genocide as Colonial Erasure” in October 2024. In the latter, Albanese identified how Israel was expanding its genocide from Gaza to the West Bank. Her analysis holds that there are three main elements of Israel’s colonialist takeover: displacement, replacement, and erasure. Genocide is the most extreme form of erasure, but it is a part of the larger eliminationist logic within a broader plan of “colonial erasure.” Given her mandate on territories occupied since 1967, that is where Albanese focuses her analysis. The Israeli occupation since 1967 has had broad economic support, particularly from the corporate world, and these actors have mostly continued that support as Israel has moved to its next stage of colonial erasure: Genocide. The focus of this report is to show how corporations have enabled the displacement, replacement, and erasure of Palestinian life, exposing “the integration of the economies of settler-colonial occupation and genocide.” The report finishes with a stirring call to action. In Albanese’s words, “Commercial endeavours enabling and profiting from the obliteration of innocent people’s lives must cease. Corporate entities must refuse to be complicit in human rights violations and international crimes or be held to account.” A post shared by Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@francesca.albanese.unsr.opt) The economic actors facilitating displacement are mostly companies that are involved with heavy equipment, weapons, and tech surveillance. There is a myriad of actors, directly or through subsidiaries. For example, Caterpillar is a well-known example with its deep collaboration with Israeli weapons manufacturers and military: “For decades, Caterpillar Inc. has provided Israel with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes and infrastructure, through both the United States Foreign Military Financing programme and an exclusive licensee requisitioned by Israeli law into the military. In partnership with companies such as Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Leonardo DRS, Inc.-owned RADA Electronic Industries, Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, “neutralizing” the territory and killing Palestinians.” This has placed Caterpillar at the center of genocide in Gaza: “Since October 2023, Caterpillar equipment has been documented as being used to carry out mass demolitions – including of homes, mosques and life-sustaining infrastructure – raid hospitals and burying alive wounded Palestinians. In 2025, Caterpillar secured a further multi-million dollar contract with Israel.” But there are many other examples in this industry as well: “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to the destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers. Volvo’s licensee is an OHCHR database-listed company [UN database lists business enterprises that have “directly and indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the settlements”] and together they own Merkavim Transportation Technologies Ltd., which produces armoured buses sold to service colonies. Since at least 2007, Volvo machinery has been used to raze Palestinian areas, including in East Jerusalem and Masafer Yatta. For over a decade, HD Hyundai machinery has been used to demolish Palestinian homes and raze farmland, including olive groves.” And these become tools of genocide: “After October 2023, Israel increased the use of the equipment of those companies in the urban destruction of Gaza, including in flattening Rafah and Jabalia, after which the military obscured their logos.” Military tech surveillance is a big part of the Israeli colonialist displacement regime. Israeli companies such as the NSO Group have built a global market for their surveillance technology, but the report also names several well-known international corporations and outlines their roles in supporting Palestinian displacement. These include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Palantir. Once Israel displaces Palestinians, a wide array of businesses support the consolidation of its control through the creation and maintenance of Israeli colonies: construction, raw materials (often pillaged from occupied territory), agribusiness, tourism, etc. Here, there are also many international actors that facilitate the normalization of Israel’s displacement and theft: “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory. In 2024, this intensified after the administration of colonies moved from the military to the civilian Government and the Ministry of Construction and Housing budget doubled, with $200 million allotted for colony construction. From November 2023 to October 2024, Israel established 57 new colonies and outposts, with Israeli and international companies supplying machinery, raw materials and logistical support”. While the same heavy machinery providers reappear (Caterpillar, HD Hyundai, Volvo), other actors provide raw materials: “The German Heidelberg Materials AG, through its subsidiary Hanson Israel, has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank. In 2018, Hanson Israel won a public tender to supply materials from that quarry for colony construction, and has since nearly exhausted the quarry, prompting ongoing expansion requests.” Transport: “Various companies contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians. The Spanish/Basque Construcciones Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles joined a consortium with a OHCHR database-listed company to maintain and expand the Jerusalem Light Rail Red Line and build the new Green Line, at a time when other companies had withdrawn owing to international pressure. These lines include 27 kilometres of new tracks and 50 new stations in the West Bank, connecting colonies with West Jerusalem. Doosan and Volvo excavators and machinery have been used, and Heidelberg’s subsidiary supplied materials for a light-rail bridge.” Real estate: “Real estate companies sell properties in colonies to Israeli and international buyers. The global real estate group, Keller Williams Realty LLC, through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel, has had branches based in the colonies. In March 2024, Keller Williams, through another franchisee, Home in Israel, ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” And then there is “occupation tourism”, which brings in the online services, Booking.com and Airbnb: “Major online travel platforms, used by millions to reserve accommodation, profit from the occupation by selling tourism that sustains the colonies, excludes Palestinians, promotes settler narratives and legitimizes annexation. Booking Holdings Inc. and Airbnb, Inc. list properties and hotel rooms in Israeli colonies. Booking.com has more than doubled its listings in the West Bank – from 26 in 2018 to 70 by May 2023 – and tripled its East Jerusalem listings to 39 in the year post October 2023. Airbnb has also amplified its colonial profiteering, growing from 139 listings in 2016 to 350 in 2025, collecting up to 23 per cent commission. These listings are linked with restricting Palestinian access to land and endangering nearby villages. In Tekoa, Airbnb enables settler promotion of a “warm and loving community”, whitewashing settler violence against the neighbouring Palestinian village of Tuqu‘.” There is an entire interconnected network of companies, institutions, and interests that weave together to support and profit from the Israeli occupation. The entities are all enabling Israel’s illegality, and Albanese breaks them down by sector. War crimes and crimes against humanity are a risky business in general. Investing in a country that creates so much turmoil is counterintuitive for many, and many investors have bailed out of the high-tech industry, for example. That’s why financial giants are important to secure that investments in the war machine keep flowing. Albanese explains how the world’s largest banks give Israel financial cover as it carries out genocide. Albanese: “Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms – including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) – were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them. Meanwhile, the Development Corporation for Israel (i.e., Israel Bonds) provides a bond solicitation service for the Government of Israel for overseas private individuals and other investors. The Development Corporation for Israel tripled its annual bond sales to funnel nearly $5 billion to Israel since October 2023, while offering investors the option of sending the return on bond investments to charitable organizations supporting the Israeli military and the colonies.” Insurance companies then buttress this: “Global insurance companies, including [German] Allianz and AXA, also invest large sums in shares and bonds implicated in the occupation and genocide, partly as capital reserves for policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but primarily to generate returns. Allianz holds at least $7.3 billion and AXA, despite some divestment decisions, still invests at least $4.09 billion in tracked companies named in the present report. Their insurance policies also underwrite the risks other companies necessarily take when operating in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, thus enabling the commission of human rights abuses and “de-risking” the operational environment.” And pension funds are involved in this too, including Norwegian and Canadian ones: “Sovereign wealth and pension funds are also significant financiers. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, claims it has the world’s most comprehensive ethical guidelines. After October 2023, the Fund increased its investment in Israeli companies by 32 per cent to $1.9 billion. By the end of 2024, the Fund had $121.5 billion – 6.9 per cent of its total value – invested in companies named in the present report alone. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which manages Can$ 473.3 billion ($328.9 billion) in pension funds for six million Canadians, has almost Can$ 9.6 billion ($6.67 billion) invested in companies named in the present report, despite its sustainable investment policy and human rights policy. From 2023 to 2024, it almost tripled investment in Lockheed Martin, quadrupled investment in Caterpillar and increased 10-fold the investment in HD Hyundai.” But the enablers are not just financial institutions. Albanese shows how academia has also played a crucial role. The most prestigious academic institutions are tied to Israel. Like MIT: “Leading universities, especially from global-minority countries, partner with Israeli institutions in areas directly harming Palestinians. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, labs conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense – the only foreign military financing research at the Institute. Notable Israeli Ministry of Defense projects include drone swarm control – a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 – pursuit algorithms and underwater surveillance. From 2019 to 2024, the Institute managed a Lockheed Martin seed fund connecting students to teams in Israel. From 2017 to 2025, Elbit Systems paid for membership to the Institute’s Industrial Liaison Program, enabling access to research and talent.” Huge EU academic projects are involved: “The European Commission’s Horizon Europe programme actively facilitates collaboration with Israeli institutions, including those complicit in apartheid and genocide. Since 2014, the European Commission has granted over €2.12 billion ($2.4 billion) to Israeli entities, including the Ministry of Defense, while European academic institutions both benefit from and reinforce this entanglement. The Technical University of Munich receives €198.5 million ($218 million) in EC Horizon funding, including €11.47 million ($12.6 million) for 22 collaborations with Israeli partners, military and tech firms. The University and Israel Aerospace Industries receive €792,795.75 ($868,416) to jointly develop, with other participants, green hydrogen refuelling, technology relevant to Israel Aerospace Industries military drones used in Gaza. The University partners with IBM Israel – which runs the discriminatory Israeli Population Registry – on cloud and artificial intelligence systems, as part of the €7.75 million ($8.52 million) IBM Israel receives in Horizon funding. The University also collaborates on a €10.76 million ($11.71 million) project on “seamless shared urban mobility” that includes the Municipality of Jerusalem, a city entrenching annexation through urban transportation.” Agribusiness has often been seen as a trademark of Israel’s innovation, but it is inextricably connected to Israel’s occupation. “Agribusiness has thrived on Israel-led extractivism and land-grabbing – producing goods and technologies serving Israeli settler-colonial interests, expanding market dominance and attracting global investment – while erasing Palestinian food systems and accelerating displacement,” Albanese writes. She names the Israeli food giant Tnuva, and the watering giant Netafim: “Tnuva, the largest food conglomerate in Israel, now majority-owned by the Chinese Bright Food (Group) Co., Ltd., has fueled and benefited from land dispossession. Tnuva’s Chairman recognized that “agriculture … in general and dairy farming in particular are a strategic resource and a significant pillar in the settlement enterprise”. Israel has used kibbutzim and agricultural outposts to seize Palestinian land and replace Palestinians. Companies like Tnuva help by sourcing products from these colonies, then exploit the resulting captive Palestinian market to build market dominance… Netafim, a global leader in drip irrigation technology, now 80 per cent owned by the Mexican company Orbia Advance Corporation, has designed its agritech in concert with the expansion imperatives of Israel. While maintaining a global image of sustainability, Netafim technology has enabled intensive exploitation of water and land in the West Bank, further depleting Palestinian natural resources, while being refined through collaboration with Israeli military-technology firms. In the Jordan Valley, Netafim-aided irrigation systems have facilitated Israeli crop expansion, while Palestinian farmers – denied water and with 93 per cent unirrigated land – are pushed out, unable to compete with Israeli production. Furthermore, such irrigation techniques threaten to exhaust the Jordan River and Dead Sea.” Shipping giants like the Danish Mærsk then ship the goods: “Global logistics giants like A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S are integral to this ecosystem; for years they have shipped goods from the colonies and OHCHR database-listed companies straight to the United States and other markets.” And Mærsk is involved in much more than just shipping avocados: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” Those who supply Israel with energy, inevitably supply what Israel is doing – not just its colonization, but also its genocide. A lot of world actors are involved here: “Coal for electricity to Israel originates primarily from Colombia (60 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023-24); United States-headquartered Drummond Company, Inc. and the Swiss-based Glencore PLC are the primary suppliers. Their respective subsidiaries own the mines and the three ports involved in the delivery of 15 coal shipments to Israel since October 2023, including six shipments after Colombia suspended coal exports to Israel in August 2024. Glencore was also involved in shipments from South Africa; these shipments accounted for 15 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023 and 2024.” This is taking place while Israel pillages Palestinian natural resources: “The United States Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMed Energy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan. The Gaza naval blockade is connected to Israel securing the Tamar gas supply and the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline. At a time of increasing brutality, the British company BP PLC is expanding involvement in the Israeli economy, with exploration licences confirmed in March 2025, which allow BP to explore Palestinian maritime expanses illegally exploited by Israel.” While all these sectors of industry help contribute to and enable the Israeli occupation in one way or another, it cannot be forgotten that the Israeli military and weapons industry are a primary vehicle for and beneficiary of Israel’s military aggression and genocide. Albanese naturally has a section focused on the military sector, titled “Military sector – the business of elimination,” which shows how its military industry serves a major national and international economic interest. Albanese explains: “The military-industrial complex has become the economic backbone of the State. Between 2020 and 2024, Israel was the eighth-largest arms exporter worldwide. The two most prominent Israeli weapons companies – Elbit Systems, established as a public-private partnership and later privatized, and State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries – are among the top 50 arms manufacturers globally.” And there’s the cooperation with the U.S., which has culminated in the F-35 jet program, a massive international effort: “Israel benefits from the largest-ever defence procurement programme – for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin, alongside at least 1,650 other companies, including Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A, and eight States… Post-October 2023, F-35s and F-16s have been integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” There are also the Elbit drones, which is also the product of international collaboration: “Suppliers such as the Japanese FANUC Corporation provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin”. And shipping, of course, so once again Mærsk: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” So while there is the raw military industry, which people obviously associate with the worst of the attacks against Palestinians – but there is so much more to Israel’s apparatus of control over Palestine and Palestinians. It is so enormous and so globally interconnected that it would be hard to find a person in this world who doesn’t know at least one of the corporations involved. Albanese concludes with her recommendations for states, corporations, the ICC, and the UN. For corporations, this is to “cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international crimes against the Palestinian people” and to pay reparations to the Palestinian people. She offers the example of an apartheid wealth tax along the lines of post-apartheid South Africa. For states and international bodies, such as the ICC and UN, Albanese calls on them to enforce the accountability mechanisms at their disposal, not only on Israel, but on the corporations who are enabling its illegal action. In addition, she called on states to impose sanctions and a full arms embargo on Israel. And then finally, she has a call to action for us in civil society: “The Special Rapporteur urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can end these unspeakable crimes.” Albanese outlines a worldwide network of collaboration that enables Israel’s genocide in one way or another. It is overwhelming to consider, and some may be daunted by its enormity, but it is not an invincible system. It operates on elements that are very mundane: resources and money. It is dependent on an economic network and on global consent. And here lies the key to dismantling it. Albanese ends: “The complicity exposed by the report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including its executives. International law recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring scrutiny and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s self-determination and very existence are at stake. This is a necessary step to end the genocide and dismantle the global system that has allowed it.” Jonathan Ofir Jonathan Ofir is an Israeli musician, conductor and writer based in Denmark.

(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider what the core of your portfolio will ... More be made up of and your investment aims. You could spend your $1,000 on anything, but you made the wise decision to invest it in equities to grow your wealth. This guide will share some of the best stocks for 2025 including growth, income and volatile but high-returning opportunities. These recommendations are based on analyst ratings, sector exposure, earnings and recent momentum. As you consider this mix of equity options including the "magnificent seven” stocks, large value-oriented companies, REITs and technology stocks, you’ll see some familiar names as well as learn new ones, each with interesting theses as to why you should consider them for your portfolio. Ultimately, constructing a portfolio is research intensive and while you may not invest in each of these picks, you’ll hopefully be exposed to new industries and gain insight into the vast array of stock opportunities at your disposal. Microsoft is a tech giant and household name known for a variety of products from software with Office and Windows, to cloud computing services with Azure, to gaming with Xbox. Its latest venture in AI, through Copilot in partnership with OpenAI, is bringing AI functionality to a broader audience in hopes of better competing with Google and Apple, both of whom are expanding AI features to their customer bases. This behemoth tech stock is a pick because of both its strong balance sheet and consistent earnings, as well as its reliable dividend. Microsoft is also worthwhile to consider for your stock portfolio because of its aforementioned offering of Azure, the customer base of which is growing 14.2% year-over-year, with over 350,000 organizations utilizing it. This strong showing makes Microsoft more competitive with Amazon’s AWS, a dominant cloud services provider. Microsoft is an ideal fit for investors seeking a long-term hold stock delivering innovation-fueled growth, a strong leadership team, and security in a world adapting to AI. You’ve likely heard of NVIDIA in the context of its dominance in the world of chips, with the company holding over 80% market share for sale of data center GPUs. In particular, NVIDIA’s H100 and its now in full production Blackwell chips which power AI training and compute for the top technology firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s growth isn’t slowing down with revenue in Q1 up 69% from a year ago. While this firm does have a high P/E, NVIDIA backs it up with strong revenue and income rising as more firms invest in AI to capture its promise. The majority of analysts also maintain this stock as a buy or strong buy. NVIDIA is a good fit for those who want a high-growth stock with more room to grow, who don’t prioritize a dividend yield and who are bullish on the continued adoption of AI. Long associated with its founder, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway is a large firm delivering broad exposure to industries like insurance through Geico, car manufacturers like Mitsubishi, and technology like Apple. While Buffett may have recently stepped down, Berkshire is in solid leadership hands with years of experience working under Buffett’s tutelage and with his famous methodology and wisdom, passed down by both memos and direct work experience. Berkshire holds over $340 billion in cash, awaiting a market downturn or the right opportunities, giving them a secure buffer and investment capital for their next big stakes. While Berkshire offers no dividend, this stock offers high returns with over 20% returned over the last year. This stock offers diversification and a conservative value-driven investing approach to your portfolio. Visa is a credit card-processing giant which processes north of 40 billion transactions annually, earning fees from each purchase. With a moat built around its network which is global, billions of cards in use, deep integration with financial institutions and over 1 billion more cards in circulation than its primary competitor, Mastercard, Visa is well positioned to provide financial sector exposure and security to investors. Visa continues to expand, with new partnerships penetrating into emerging markets, and growth from digital payments through providers like Apple Pay. A majority of analysts consider Visa a buy or strong buy based on its financials and growth prospects. Investors who want a dominant financial sector stock which is conservative and global would be well suited to buy this stock. Palantir is a technology company which offers software systems primarily to the U.S. government but also to corporate clients with a suite of platforms delivering data integration, intelligence and analysis. Two of its primary platforms are Foundry, which is used for data centralization and analysis by healthcare companies, commercial firms and governments, as well as Gotham, which is an intelligence and data platform used for defense. With year-over-year revenue growth of 39% and a recent contract with the U.S. government of more than $100 million, Palantir is well positioned for growth from both its commercial and government platforms. Palantir is a mixed bag in analysts’ eyes with many considering it a stock to hold rather than buy. But with a moat of hard-to-acquire contracts from major firms and government actors and increasingly-advanced products fueled by AI, Palantir could be a worthwhile growth play in your portfolio. Ideal investors for this stock would be those comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term growth who are not seeking a dividend. Realty Income is a top REIT that owns thousands of commercial properties which lease space to firms like Walgreens, FedEx and other well-known consumer-facing companies. Investors choose O for reliable, monthly dividends which have been paying out income for decades even in the midst of economic downturns. Realty Income offers around 5.6% in dividends making it a desirable option for investors seeking reliable income, like retirees, those supplementing their own income or investors seeking to round out a growth-heavy portfolio. Realty Income’s diverse clients provide some resiliency even in down markets, and this stock has performed well even as growth stocks dip in price. O could be a good addition to your portfolio if you’re seeking to balance out other equities, if you’re seeking income or would simply like real estate exposure without buying land or properties yourself. Carvana is a technology-driven firm which makes it easy for consumers to buy or finance cars online. While its business suffered and nearly went bankrupt in 2022, it grew considerably over the last two years, nearly reaching its 2021 peak of just over $360 a share. This return to life was due to its innovative car purchasing model and drastically reduced costs. Carvana is a volatile, growth-driven stock that should be considered by investors seeking short-term gains as it rises in value. Over the last year it experienced a return of over 172% without sign of slowing down. As with Strategy, which will be discussed next, consider your risk tolerance and what percentage of your portfolio you would feel comfortable risking for juiced portfolio returns. Bitcoin treasury companies are a big trend in 2025 as they bet on bitcoin’s continued growth and adoption. The principal driver of this trend is Strategy Incorporated (previously Microstrategy). Strategy holds almost 600,000 Bitcoin, each valued as of July 1, 2025 at $105,820, and continues to buy the cryptocurrency by issuing debt or equity. This stock has risen over 170% in the last year fueled by easing of regulation on crypto, clearance of bitcoin ETFs and speculation that bitcoin will continue to rise in price. Microstrategy is thought of by some as a leveraged BTC play as MSTR often grows by 2x to 3x the growth of bitcoin, but this leverage can work in the opposite direction if bitcoin crashes. MSTR is a worthwhile investment for investors who don’t mind the high risk that the stock or BTC carries, in the hopes of continued high growth. If you do consider using part of your $1,000 to purchase MSTR, understand the risk that both this stock and bitcoin carries and invest according to your risk tolerance. Bottom Line When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider your risk tolerance, but also what the core of your portfolio will be made up of and your investment aims. From this list, a good core stock makeup for stability, quality and reasonable growth would be Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa and Berkshire Hathaway. Good growth stocks to add in moderation and according to risk tolerance, are Palantir and Carvana. For additional yield, Realty Income could be added to deliver monthly dividends and stability in downturns, and finally, Strategy could be added to deliver crypto exposure as well as the potential for high returns. This stock mix with your $1,000 would deliver income, growth and portfolio stability. Ultimately there are thousands of stocks available to consider for your portfolio but with research, analysis and consideration of your financial position, you can grow your net worth and achieve the future you seek.

Ukraine’s power distribution operator said its technicians had taken action to restore it. Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is not operating but still requires power to keep its nuclear fuel cool, switched during the outage to running on diesel generators, the IAEA said.’ Pull the other one. It plays jingle Bells. Of course neither the Ukrainian energy minister nor the IAEA makes mention of whose diesel generators were used to supply power.

As then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano revealed in March 2018, the association’s penetration of Tehran was unprecedented. At a press conference, Amano referred to the IAEA’s nuclear “verification regime” in Iran as “the world’s most robust.” The organization’s inspectors spent “3,000 calendar days per year on the ground” in the country, capturing “hundreds of thousands of images captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras,” which was “about half of the total number of such images that we collect throughout the world.” In all, “over one million pieces of open source information” were collected by the IAEA monthly. The IAEA’s fixation on Iran, coupled with suspicions that it provided the names of nuclear scientists – later assassinated by Israel – raises the question: Was the 2015 deal always an industrial-scale espionage operation designed to prepare for war? A wave of assassinations of nuclear scientists and IRGC commanders in the early stages of Tel Aviv’s failed war on Iran appears to support that conclusion. Iranian officials not only suspended cooperation with the IAEA and ordered the dismantlement of inspection cameras, but also rejected Grossi’s request to visit bombed nuclear sites. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi branded the IAEA chief’s insistence on visiting under the pretext of safeguards “meaningless and possibly even malign in intent.” What is clear is that any state still cooperating with the IAEA must now reckon with the possibility that it is not being monitored – it is being mapped for war. (…)” Nor who is delivering target coordinates…… The doodle house looks like aestethic torture. No place where you can rest your eyes and mind. It reminds me of the dazzle camouflage used to befuddle adversaries during WWI. I am not sure I could walk in that house without constantly stumbling on steps and stairs, knocking against doors and walls, and losing my bearings. Possibly a good deterrent against burglars. Those dazzle ships were just trans-zebras wannabes, unlike the Tijuana donkeys. :) Wouldn’t wanna be tripping while being in that house. …… or macro-dosing! It would appear that living with it didn’t do much for the artist’s peace of mind, either. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czd54lvjnmmo Exactly. A better lomg-form article on Mr Doodle appeared in the Guardian recently dealing with his psychotic breakdown. https://archive.is/MEcLA Thanks Revenant. As you say, much more informative than the typically thin BBC gruel. For those that want to experience lighter version of this type of sensory overload in real life, there are cafés around the World. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ9Gk-7yzu4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONci9ykySAQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oOGIVNOu-s OCD As a visual artist with a particular interest in social / political art and cultural politics, I can’t help but find the whole story disturbing. Artists have always required documentation of some kind to receive recognition / financial success, but the level of self-aware, social-media popularity that drives someone like this not only gives me anxiety just to think about it, but — not unlike ‘selfie culture’ — I can’t personally imagine what it would mean to be so self-conscious about every mark being made, and how that affects the process. And that doesn’t begin to cover the contradictory “college trained outsider artists,” audiences obsessed with the idea of mental illness and creativity, or the straight-up derivative nature of the work — not just Mr. Doodle but the numerous artists working in this ‘all-over’ high-contrast style, indistinguishable from each other (unless maybe you care to learn their individual preferred iconography). Living in Brooklyn there were multiple artists using this style and winning public-art / mural commissions. Someone wisely said to me “don’t ever harsh on another artist’s hustle,” which is good advice, since it’s a shit career if you don’t have either inherited or ‘partner’ family money. But damn, I don’t know where the satisfaction comes in with this hustle for the artists. At its core the work itself is entirely forgettable once the viewer gets past the ‘wow’ factor of x-space being covered by patterns. Agree. In the above childishness though I would guess it really is merely an (art) performance only (any financial incentive known?), blending profession and private life into one for a limited period (is this his real and only home or is it truly just a performative art space?) – just like so-called star movie actors who cannot step outside of their homes any more – accepting however that a state of loss of privacy is guaranteeing their income. Quid pro quo. If the doodles had been done as fractals. That would have been awesome. It’s so very derivative of Keith Haring but without the soul and the radical left and gay politics. It makes me ill that this is what people want. Add the Ukrainian bride to the equation and I’m nearly ready to off myself, as an artist who put it somewhere aside in order to make a living as a lawyer (sigh). During my year in art school I became increasingly put off by the fine arts scene to the point where my end-of-year essay was titled “From Post-Modernism to Post-Relevancy: The Current Era of Art” and was basically just a diatribe of the insular elitist culture that had no connection to society outside their small circles nor interest in any art that did resonate with regular people. After dropping out I moved to NYC and my first job was at a restaurant where the owner was close friends with Mark Kostabi and had his art all over the walls. His cold appropriation of the Warhol factory system was about as vapid and exploitive as a third world garment factory. He would even have his “assistants” do napkin doodles which he would then sign. Also catered another “pop” artist’s gallery show which was attended by Donald and Marla Maples. The gaudy affair cemented my distain for the fine art scene. The type of art they celebrate and the crowds that flock to it are the last ones who should be doing so. And, as has been discussed here before, it’s primarily just a money laundering racket anyway. This is why I actually love the “banana duct-taped to a wall”. It’s one of the only works of art in recent times that spoke to regular people and clearly expressed much of what is wrong with this industry. The fine arts collapse into irrelevancy really was the canary in the coal mine for culture in general. Elites glad-handing each other over derivative meaningless slop at decadent celeb-idolizing affairs where untold wealth is garnered while completely insulated from the lives, ideas, and culture of the rest of humanity. This insulation is like inbreeding and each generation of art degenerates. As you said, this doodle art has fragments of Haring DNA but minus any of the qualities that made his work vibrant and alive. Its posh hotel room art. The documentary “Exit Through The Gift Shop” best expresses it in showing how a guy used money, celebs, and PR to become and overnight artworld hotshot named Mr Brainwash. This welcoming of “popular” art is evident at all levels of the “art market.” Case in point being the time I helped Phyllis run a tent at a regional arts and crafts fair in Southern Mississippi. It was somewhat inland, but close enough to the Gulf Coast to attract quite a lot of that crowd. Over a three-day weekend, a holiday no less, Phyl sold exactly no works; which included watercolours, hand-made jewelry, and fall themed wreaths, made from dried flowers, and similar ingredients. The wreaths were particularly good. Phyl has an eye for colour and form. In the tent behind us was a group selling gaudy, tinsel, foil, and christmas tree light, (the tiny variety,) wreaths. All these objects did not have were tiny elves singing “O Holy Night” in Chipmunk voices. They charged pretty high prices. They sold a lot of their stock, because, as one of the women running the booth told me; “These styles are all the rage right now. You know, popular in the womens magazines and all.” So, despair not, the Alchemist’s Creed is alive and well in America. As Above, So Below. Stay safe. Luck with your calling. Very true. It’s not easy for substantive art to stand out next to shiny objects. Like with anything (food, books, fashion, etc) most have their tastes defined by convenience, novelty, and consensus. We often claim we are tired of the same ol’ same but lack the willingness to seek out experiences which may challenge and even disappoint us. Or worse yet, others might judge us negatively for liking! I appreciate your kind words of encouragement. I try to not let my pessimism derail my focus on trying to make art that might matter to regular people. As a good friend who has been very successful making real art once told me: “That which takes time, time will respect.” (He heard that quote elsewhere and didn’t remember who said it). Did someone say gift shop? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R7VChN-jKc The cat olympics video is generated by AI (as its title indicates). The $387M penthouse may be a real one, but it also looks as something that could be generated by AI. Or to put it in another way: architectural slop by real architects serves to train AI so that it can produce more architectural slop in turn. I am not sure I could even find aged Wagyu beef where I live, but that meat seems to me to be marbled with a real lot of fat? And one should pay over $7000 per kg for that? Something escapes me. Viewing the cat olympics video is an experience similar to viewing a boring cartoon. Waste of time. Ugly slab of meat? Space age penthouse? Ooooosie. More waste of time. NC, do better. It would be a benefit if sites could moderate and not post AI, especially videos. Imagine in a year or so it could be a true benefit to readership claiming that “no AI videos are posted on our site”, essentially, an “organic blog”. Bon courage NC. AI is not allowed and I am ripping out the cat Olympics. TYVM! In defense of the site; have you seen some of the real trash floating around the webs lately? Mr. Doodle is sane in comparison. I was maybe going to suggest that reading the articles is more thought provoking than just driving by and looking at the pictures. Also it’s good to know whats out there, how to spot ai crap, what lengths rich morons will go to to justify or trumpet their untouchability, and the animal kingdom antidotes, well if you read the articles generally speaking, and this considering the sorry state of our little rock hurtling unspecified through space, you need the animal kingdom antidotes just to decompress a little. Agreed. The sea otter video was a wonderful anecdote to the dire articles today and a perfect reminder of why it all matters. … reading the articles is more thought provoking than just driving by and looking at the pictures. That was the excuse for everyone having a Playboy magazine back in the day. :) No, it was for the stereo ads. It’s just a Sunday Supplement chronicle. It is interesting (and rather saddening) to compare the high-diving cats with the high-diving giraffes that I first discovered here on NC maybe 10 years ago?? My grandkids still ask to watch this. I think the main difference is that the high-diving giraffe video tells a little story. It’s not a very advanced story, but it’s cute. AI has a very hard time telling stories because of the lack of object permanence and inability to take detailed instructions (because it’s just statistical generation). David Gerard covered it recently at Pivot-to-AI, with rather funny examples of what happens if you try to generate famous (serious) scenes. If you just try to get the AI to tel the story, yes it won’t get you there. But people are now starting to make coherent short films with it, but it requires some film-making skills and some actual work. The character consistency issue is mostly solved, but there is still work to do. It will be a non-issue in a few months. Well I don’t mind the occasional ‘daily antitoxin’ post to keep me aware of what the scams literally looks like. This was definitely dreck. When the dive turns into that cartoon blur, it lost me completely. They couldn’t even make it up to the uncanny valley. Fatty beef ala prime rib roasts and rib eye steaks can be very delicious, the fat marbling is the key to good meat with those cuts. As for Waygu, like most luxury goods, it is not worth the upgrade. I’ve tasted Waygu (not at that kind of price), it is good but not so much better than prime rib that I would try it again. There is a farmer around here who uses Japanese methods to produce Waygu-like beef, people say it is delicious and while not as expensive as Japanese Waygu, it is pricey and I don’t see a reason to try it. My mother grew up on a dairy farm. She would always trim the fat she served us as children. Then she would eat the trimmings herself. She lived to 99 and was never fat herself. Of course, back in the day, local livestock ate very little, if any lipophilic agricultural toxins … Fat is flavor, according to people all over the world. Yum! It also satiates so a kind of dietish food reducing cravings for carbohydrates. YMMV “Fat is flavor” is yet another empty slogan Internet influencers use to entertain hoi polloi. It’s all about catchphrases. Iberico pork otoh, so so worth it. The penthouse is real. According to Google image search, it is located in the Odeon Tower in Monaco. Yes, it exists! And for anyone in the commentariat with 387m clams lying around with nothing to do, here is a handy link: https://www.thepinnaclelist.com/properties/tour-odeon-tower-sky-penthouse-principality-monaco/ I’m sure the 387m is just a highball asking price (a la Trump); they’ll probably settle for 350m. I always enjoy haggling at Tuscany’s outdoor antique markets (admittedly for drastically lower amounts). Is it my imagination, or does that $387M penthouse look like it has a giant toilet in the front? Flush the oligarchs! re: Gaza / James Baldwin machine-translation from German daily JUNGE WELT Historical reflections James Baldwin recognized parallels between the situation of Black people in the USA and the situation of Palestinians in Israel By Jürgen Heiser https://archive.is/bxvOJ `For this reason, Baldwin largely dealt with the relations between Blacks and Jews in “The Harlem Ghetto,” criticizing not only their political but also their spiritual leaders. In religious terms, Baldwin argued, African Americans identified with the Hebrews of the Old Testament: “It is the Old Testament that is most often clung to and preached from. It provides the emotional fire and dissects the pain of slavery.” But for African Americans, this very identification with the ancient Hebrews became a source of bitterness. Jewish businessmen in Harlem were complicit in the white exploitation of Blacks. They were therefore “also identified with the oppression and hated for it.” (…) In contrast, Black people in the United States identified almost entirely with the fate of the Jews. The most devout among them felt like Jews themselves and waited for Moses to lead them out of Egypt: “As Israel was chosen, so they also consider themselves chosen. The images of the suffering Christ and the suffering Jew are combined with the image of the suffering slave, and they are one: The people who walked in darkness saw a brilliant light!” (…) In the controversial essay “Open Letter to the Born Again,” published in The Nation on September 29, 1979,² Baldwin concluded: “The State of Israel was not created to save the Jews, but to save Western interests. This is now becoming clear (I must say it was always clear to me). The Palestinians have been paying a high price for more than 30 years for the British colonial policy of ‘divide and rule’ and for Europe’s guilty Christian conscience.” Baldwin had been concerned with the Palestinian conflict since the early 1960s, but his views changed radically over time. In his earlier essays, he rarely mentioned the Palestinians. Later, however, Baldwin adopted an increasingly critical stance toward Israeli policies, and his solidarity with the Palestinian liberation struggle grew. In 2024, journalist Alexander Durie, writing in the US online magazine Literary Hub on the occasion of Baldwin’s 100th birthday, referred to the Palestinian scholar Nadia Alahmed.³ The activist works as an assistant professor of African and Middle Eastern Studies at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Durie pointed out to him that after Baldwin changed his mind about Israel, he consistently criticized Tel Aviv’s policies: “Baldwin was one of the first significant Black American voices to recognize the State of Israel for what it truly is.”´ I’ll give Baldwin the nod to being very early to write about the reality of Israel and Palestine. But I think many people have long recognized the state of Israel for what it truly is and as is often said around here, their financial interests mean they must ignore that reality. With reference to America, but applicable to beneficiaries of imperialism everywhere: “But for power truly to feel itself menaced, it must somehow sense itself in the presence of another power—or, more accurately, an energy—which it has not known how to define and therefore does not really know how to control. For a very long time, for example, America prospered—or seemed to prosper: this prosperity cost millions of people their lives. Now, not even the people who are the most spectacular recipients of the benefits of this prosperity are able to endure these benefits: they can neither understand them nor do without them, nor can they go beyond them. Above all, they cannot, or dare not, assess or imagine the price paid by their victims, or subjects, for this way of life, and so they cannot afford to know why the victims are revolting. They are forced, then, to the conclusion that the victims—the barbarians—are revolting against all established civilized values—which is both true and not true—and, in order to preserve these values, however stifling and joyless these values have caused their lives to be, the bulk of the people desperately seek out representatives who are prepared to make up in cruelty what both they and the people lack in conviction. This is a formula for a nation’s or a kingdom’s decline, for no kingdom can maintain itself by force alone.” ― James Baldwin, No Name in the Street (circa 1972) More evidence of Trump’s bad character (vengefulness) courtesy of Steven A. Smith: (Not that we need any more, but the anecdote is telling, IMO) Big, beautiful bill dumped effort to tighten tax laws for NFL owners By Mike Florio Published July 5, 2025 01:58 PM When the big, beautiful bill left the House for the Senate, it contained a provision that would have created anything but a tax cut for the mega-wealthy. By the time the final bill was signed into law, the provision that would have harmed sports owners was not included. We’re told that the Senate’s version eliminated the wrinkle that would have removed the ability of sports-league owners to write off the entire value of “intangible assets” (like player contracts and media-rights deals) over 15 years, and that the House did not reinsert it. The change would have reduced the ability to write off intangible assets from 100 percent to 50 percent. As previously explained by the New York Times, the tax break can equate to “hundreds of millions of dollars,” because intangible assets “make up the bulk of a team’s worth.” The Times reported that some owners believe the change to the tax laws “feels punitive,” with President Trump seeking leverage over NFL owners. “The president is committed to ensuring that sports teams overcharging ticketholders do not receive favorable tax treatment,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields told the Times in a statement issued in late May. “His focus is on fairness for fans, not team ownership.” Why would the President want to stick it to NFL owners? Consider what Stephen A. Smith said last month on The Daily Show. “In 2014, he wanted to purchase the NFL’s Buffalo Bills,” Smith told Jon Stewart on June 9. “The price tag was $1.4 billion. . . . My sources tell me he had $1.1 [billion]. . . . He literally called me in 2014 and he said, ‘Stephen, I’m going to tell you this right now’ — and this is a quote — ‘if them (expletive deleted) get in my way, I’m gonna get them all back. I’m gonna run for president.’ Those are his exact words.” https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/big-beautiful-bill-dumped-effort-to-tighten-tax-laws-for-nfl-owners Trump’s dalliances with pro American football date back to the New Jersey Generals, his USFL franchise that featured Herschel Walker, Doug Flutie and coached by Jim Mora. I’ll have to fact check the player profiles and league dates but eventually it was Trump that insisted on challenging the NFL, 800 lb gorilla back then in court, circa the middle 80s. There were some hilarious high jinks from league players back then, rushing to cash their paycheck, that anecdote came from a different team in the league… The move into court just boded ill fated news for the fledgling spring football league, and a fatal blow to the USFL as a league. Back to the topic on tax laws, I’m sure no Senator or Congress rep would stoop so low as to do the bidding of influential billionaire class or team owners… meanwhile the poor must gladly enjoy taking their bowl of mush ala per Dickensian imagery. As a Bills fan, I should probably say a prayer of thanks every day that Trump did not end up owning the Bills. The NFL owners are notoriously a tight-knit and snobby club, and probably correctly sensed that letting Trump into their circle would be an epically bad idea. Like allowing a street prostitute to hang out with them. Can you imagine? Trump would be firing Bills players and hiring others based on his extensive knowledge of the game, there would be shouting matches with the individual players wrecking team play, he would be getting into fights with other NFL owner while trying to poach their players with his money and his strategy would change on a day by day basis. Yeah, that was one big bullet dodge that. Trump would surely not be a “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Here are some big, beautiful Bills: Josh Allen, Bruce Smith, and Dion Dawkins (6’4, 320 lbs.) Exhibit #1, Carolina Panthers team owner David Tepper Exhibit #2, New York Jets team owner Woody Johnson. Maybe with the coming fall, hope renews for these forlorn team fan bases; but even the hard core devotees really ought to question that investment of time. Being in the coterie of 30 or so wealthy team owners just might mean, that a select handful of these billionaires are comfortable at setting their own franchise investment into a roaring dumpster fire of roadside theater. Not on my list is the LV Raiders, whereby majority team owner Marc Davis is paying former employees after a consistent failure at hiring a head coach or related coaching staff… Counterpoint: if he’d been allowed to buy the Bills, maybe the rest of the world would’ve been spared from his political aspirations. It’s hard to imagine that Trump could be worse than the Haslams, e.g. Johnny Manziel and DeShaun Watson. The Hunts are a-hole billionaires always looking to grab taxpayer money, but they do stay out of running the team. Caligula comes to mind. Even ordering expensive shick and awe against a site buried un a couple hundred meters of granite. Like going to war with Neptune. Chic and awe sounds like Melania Trump’s fashion collection. :) “Elon Musk floats strategy for new political party” I would imagine that his strategy is to try to build up a party to challenge Trump and the Republicans. And when the latter return all those subsidies for EVs such as Teslas to make him go away, he will dissolve that party and tell all the people that followed him to vote for Trump’s Republicans. Will people forget that this was the guy put in charge of taking a wrecking ball to the machinery of Federal government whose effects we are seeing in Texas right now? While USAF is cancelling SPACEX to give the business back to the vendors that lost it to SPACEX. Would one of those vendors be Boeing? :) Serial failures in AF orbital launch are from a number Boeing, General Dynamics, an entity called United Launch Associate (ULA)… the line of vendors is ample for “protected” competitions between incompetents. In 1972 a NCO told me “no one ever lost money selling to Uncle Sam”. I have observed no reason to dispute that claim. Another $150B for competitions of incompetence! I imagine Musk has too many enemies to get anywhere. My memory is hazy, but did Trump do much for the 2022 cycle? This is where I can see pressure being brought. The Koch Brothers wielded power because they gave early and often, mostly early. With budget cuts, I can see the GOP elected getting antsy. Musk seems to be following the philosophy of George W. Bush: If two wrongs don’t make a right, maybe we need three or four instead! And heaven knows with only two billionaire parties, the market is far from saturated… re: COVID THEORY & CONCEPT Int. J. Public Health, 30 May 2025 Volume 70 – 2025 | https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2025.1607727 What Lessons can Be Learned From the Management of the COVID-19 Pandemic? https://www.ssph-journal.org/journals/international-journal-of-public-health/articles/10.3389/ijph.2025.1607727/full During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023), governments around the world implemented an unprecedented array of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. From early 2021, these were accompanied by major population-wide COVID-19 vaccination programmes–often using novel mRNA/DNA technology, although some countries used traditional vaccines. Both the NPIs and the vaccine programmes were apparently justified by highly concerning model projections of how the pandemic could progress in their absence. Efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation during the pandemic meant that differing scientific opinions on each of these aspects inevitably received unequal weighting. In this perspective review, based on an international multi-disciplinary collaboration, we identify major problems with many aspects of these COVID-19 policies as they were implemented. We show how this resulted in adverse impacts for public health, society, and scientific progress. Therefore, we propose seven recommendations to reduce such adverse consequences in the future. Nice link, thank you. On aspect of the failure of the COVID response is that CDC is still recommending the vaccines. It is prudent to review past problems but it’s worth our while to keep an eye on current mistakes ~ mistakes that are ongoing. Dr. Philip McMillan has been keeping an eye on this for quite a while. In a recent video (20 minutes), he informs us that Taiwan has shortened the gap between boosters to two months. In a CDC publication in October, 2024, they are discussing dosing every 2 months. By following CDC’s trajectory of “recommendations” he posits “when will it be, every month, every 2 weeks??” Can you imagine taking a measles vax every 2 months? Immune disfunction anyone? These people are morons Although the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was somewhat unseasonal (beginning in Northern Hemisphere spring) and cases were identified in summer periods, it is now apparent that there was a significant seasonal component to the dynamic of the pandemic (especially after accounting for changes in testing capacity). Other human coronaviruses in the same family as SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a strong seasonality in their incidence–reaching a sharp peak in mid-winter and having a very low incidence during the summer [82, 85–87]. Therefore, several studies suggested early on that this seasonality in coronavirus incidence might also influence the pandemic dynamics [82, 85–91]. Others disagreed and argued that SARS-CoV-2 should not be treated like other “seasonal” infections, because seasonality could not be (solely) used to characterise the early pandemic progression, e.g., outbreaks during summer and spring periods [4, 92–95]. Nonetheless, while these points rule out seasonality as the sole factor, most mid-to-high-latitude countries experienced major SARS-CoV-2 waves during the winter months and marked reductions during summer months, suggesting that seasonality is at least a contributing factor [88, 96–99]. That’s just not true; SARS-CoV-2 is not seasonal. And we have over 5 years of data to demonstrate this now. Granted they might have a very peculiar definition of “seasonal”, but out in the real world, if you can get infected year round, and you get additional albeit smaller waves at other times of the year in addition to a large “seasonal” wave, that’s not seasonal. They also believe GBD was a serious call for an alternative approach to NPIs, however flawed their rollout and enforcement may have been, and there’s nothing about GBD that can or should be taken seriously. In late 2020, three prominent epidemiologists wrote the Great Barrington Declaration (https://gbdeclaration.org/), advocating for a more “focused protection” strategy that prioritised the most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly the elderly [176], rather than the diffuse strategies of population-wide NPIs that they were “gravely concerned” were leading to “damaging physical and mental health impacts”. At the time of writing, the declaration has had 941,261 signatories including 16,176 medical and public-health scientists and 47,839 medical practitioners. Yet, rather than leading to a public discussion over whether alternative strategies could be adopted, the declaration was immediately dismissed as allegedly promoting “potentially dangerous fallacies” [102]. Behind the scenes, the then-director of the National Institutes of Health apparently tried to organise “a quick and devastating published take down of its premises” because it “seems to be getting a lot of attention” [177]. The only consolation in any of this is the virus treats everyone the same, and these authors won’t be spared its effects either. The history of the ongoing Pandemic is very much being written by people that are stupid, malicious, or both. They use signatories as a sign of weight, and we know some were literally faked: Herd immunity letter signed by fake experts including ‘Dr Johnny Bananas’ ndividual academics from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Stanford, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Exeter, Sussex and York were among experts from around the world who signed the declaration. However, the declaration’s website allows anyone to add their name to the list if they provide an email address, home city, postcode and name. Signatories also tell the site whether they are medical and public health scientists, medical practitioners or members of the general public – of whom almost 160,000 claim to have signed.

Self-colonialism in this case. re: CANNES film festival diary LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS What happens at Cannes by Daniella Shreir https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n12/daniella-shreir/diary “(…) I arrived​ in Cannes with a terrible line from Sélection officielle ringing in my head: ‘To paraphrase Woody Allen,’ Frémaux writes, ‘Cannes is like sex: even when it’s not good, it’s good.’ No one is immune to a degree of corniness when it comes to Cannes. David Lynch’s Cannes Diary, a ten-part series of short missives documenting his experience as jury president in 2002, is primarily a vehicle for him to indulge his love of café au lait, pain au chocolat, baguette avec fromage and vin rouge. He praises the French as ‘the greatest lovers of art and protectors of art in the world’ and looks on everything with childish wonder. That wonder extends to the theatres, where audiences clap and cheer at the tacky festival animation, in which the red staircase floats up into the sky. In Lynch’s words: ‘Everybody knows about carpet. And everybody knows the colour red. So you put those two things together and you get red carpet. But there’s nothing like the red carpet at Cannes.’ Was this Cannes as good as bad sex? Bad sex is usually short. At Cannes, screenings run from 8.30 a.m. to past midnight. If you are a programmer or distributor, it’s typical to watch as many as six films a day. Members of the press rush off to file their reviews or record their podcast ‘takes’. Tickets are released at 7 a.m., four days before each screening, and disappear in seconds. It’s common for screenings to be illuminated by dots of light, as people try to book one film while watching another. (…)” After attending Cannes, a friend who used to work as a film distributor told me that she watched 70 films in one week. I asked: “How did you manage that?” She: “Easy. I watch the first 15 minutes and decide if we might buy the film. If not, I walk out and go watch another one.” Yep. It´s déformation professionelle. In my youth I watched around 5/day in one week of festival, i.e. watch completely. It did give you a decent understanding and overview of what was happening in the art form. I do not know how I would operate today if I had to for job reasons. A certain level of cynicism comes with the job, with the routine. Which is no excuse. And I know people who do it the “proper” way even after 40 years. If you really want to appreciate you can´t walk out. Especially if it is NOT standard fare. You never know what happens in such movies eventually. Of course the medium, the times have changed too. Musk, Bannon, Trump feud– Remember billionaires wanting to seastead? It was a cross between Galt’s Gulch and Elysium. We should expel them and their hangers-on to such a place while confiscating their wealth for the use of the 99.99%. I give it 12 months before they all killed each other, and what a shame that would be. I found the Chinese language video fascinating, particularly in how it highlights the influence of Western thinking on the development of the language. It is interesting how there is not wide spread agreement about words. It got me thinking about the limitations of traditional linguistic approaches. As I often joke, linguists could benefit from putting Noam Chomsky aside for a while and delving into the study of AI instead. Love it or hate it, AI has yielded some intriguing insights that warrant attention from linguists. For instance, Word2Vec – a foundational technique underlying GPT models – embeds words (and now tokens) into high-dimensional space, revealing fascinating structural patterns. The vector between two points in this space often conveys meaningful relationships, such as the equivalent direction and magnitude of the ‘dad’ to ‘son’ vector versus the ‘mom’ to ‘daughter’ vector. Moreover, the remarkable ability of these models to translate between vastly different languages with minimal training suggests that there may be more universal, underlying principles at play in language than we currently appreciate. In fact, some researchers are even using these tools to interpret animal languages, which raises compelling questions about the fundamental nature of communication and cognition. Perhaps it’s time for linguists to explore the intersection of AI and language more deeply, as it may hold the key to unlocking new insights into the intricacies of human language and its relationship to the natural world. Putting the shoe on the other foot, I have been reading essays by the Russian linguist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975), and it is interesting to evaluate human experiences with LLMs through the lens of his ideas. Back in the day, some linguists did, in fact, inform the development of LLMs (at one point ca. 1990, the CIA offered to “fund my laboratory”, but I of course refused). That line of research eventually led to Google search, and thence to LLMs. But as Fred Jelinek famously quipped “Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up”. That’s a nice quote. I need to use it when I speak at a conference at some point in time. I’m seeing a number of what I think of as sorting problems where AI finds useful deep patterns. It takes substantial expertise to benefit from this and it appears, in addition to energy problems, at least the western roll out of Gen AI is mitigating reproduction of expertise. If you think of it as a massively parallel quicksort on vector products, I don’t think you’re far off the mark. Some things considered as part of AI used to be known as multidimensional optimization algorithms. The sea otter clip has been on NC before and IIRC was previously under suspicion for being faked, either with AI or as a compilation of clips of different sea otter encounters. Sorry to be a downer…. Where is the over-priced penthouse, though? At those prices. Monaco or Hong Kong but it looks like the third world from its surroundings…. I appreciate your nose for fakery, Revenant. Whether contrived or not, that clip is a cheap appeal to sentiment. Aren’t we humans wonderful, compassionate creatures, and look how animals appreciate us! Some of the animal videos are wonderful and even wondrous. Too bad that we have to pick our way so carefully to single them out. Even if it is fake there are lots of good people who do bring aid to animals in need. And sometimes a little positive sentimentality can be helpful. Humanity as a whole could stand to “fake it ‘til they make it” with regard to compassion. It belongs to a genre of animals coming to people for help, with spliced together scenes of unrelated animal video. I liked one of these on YouTube and was then deluged. In this case, there were river otters and then sea otters involved, and they are different. One of the clips was taken from my home waters of Morro Bay where we have a very visible colony of sea otters. I’ve heard about the subgenre where people put animal in problem in order to come and save it. Anything for views, and no one can prove wrongdoing. The Rs have about 36% of the electorate and D’s the same. Neither is a majority party. Both need to amass support from the 28% to achieve a majority. The not brand loyal offer a diverse set of issue and culture groups. A great chunk will simply stay home if there is nothing or no one on offer. If Musk puts money into State House and Senate races (500 carefully targeted State House races would cost as much as one high spend US Senate seat), the America Party could deliver a grassroots shock to both parties. Reform sells especially well at that level. And campaign funding is tough to come by. The chatgtp and the gene-story reminds me of my days selling online poker. You would take a person having had luck and blow up the story as if there was a strategy all the time, disregarding the more or less random character of the card being dealt. I am not convinced that one diagnose makes a physician. But if this kind of diagnosis is just maths and sequence analyses maybe it could be used for proof-reading? Anybody knows more about such use-cases in medicine? ChatGTP is so misleading here it is frustrating. First the poster writes “Despite seemingly normal B12 levels”…wait…did he do a Methytmalonic Acid test or only serum B12? Because the path to making a functional B12 in humans is a long one. And did he even get his homocysteine levels checked? Because he might have a B6 deficiency that is causing the B12 deficiency by overstimulating that methylation cycle. This would mean that ChatGTP did not find a solution to his problem and the guy might just be experiencing a placebo effect. But worse yet, that MTHFR polymorphism is not directly associated with lower B12. There is a lot of slop on the internet from pseudo nutritional genomics scams that ChatGTP picked up that links A1298C to B12 deficiency but it is not true! See this study from last year…zero correlation: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00277-024-05937-z We found a trend of higher ferritin value (p = 0.05) between patients carrying MTHFR C677T homozygous and heterozygous variants. Regarding MTHFR A1298C polymorphism, we found a statistical correlation between homozygous and heterozygous variants and lower hemoglobin values (p = 0.02). We found no statistical correlation between MTHFR polymorphisms and B12 and folate levels, LDH level, spleen size, neurological symptoms, and gastropathy. Did methylB12 help him? Maybe. Will it continue to? IMHO, no. BTW, I carry that same A1298C polymorphism (he calls it a mutation but it is not a mutation, there is a big difference) but I have Aspergers, neuropathies, and illness from a pathogenic SNP in the CBS enzyme and used to have very high homocystine. Only .0008% of people carry my CBS mutation while 10% carry the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism. Thank you very much, good Sir. About 30 years ago, I started having tingling sensations after mowing grass that were lasting longer and longer, eventually several days. Despite concerns about my doctor being a quack, I made an appointment. After arriving, I found a substitute, a retired doctor originally trained in France, and described my symptoms. He asked a few questions about red meat in my diet and I assured him that I generally ate chicken, not much red meat. No tests are performed. After 3 minutes or so he leaves and comes back with a syringe and explains that he’s going to inject me with B-12 and a bunch of other vitamins. I ask if he thinks I’ll need B-12 supplements and he says that I probably will, especially if I’m not getting enough from diet. The cure was virtually instantaneous, next time I mow, no tingling. I have supplemented with various forms of B-12 and the tingling has not returned. By far my best experience with a medical practitioner ever. A couple of decades later, I find out through genetic testing that I also have single copies of a couple of MTHFR polymorphisms, 1298C and C677T, that perhaps explained my long-ago symptoms (or maybe are just coincidental.) Had that substitute doctor not been there, I’m sure I’d have had the same fate as the chat-GPT cured patient – decades of increasingly bad symptoms related to poor circulation. I agree that parenthesis linked to B12 deficiency is common and easily observed by any well trained doctor. But the correlation to the MTHFR gene is not causation. It is highly likely that people who were raised generationally on a high red meat diet probably have these polymorphisms because a diet high in offal is very high in riboflavin, which is the cofactor for the MTHFR gene. So you’re probably deficient in riboflavin as well. Re Tesla’s terrible safety record–inquiring minds might wonder why Teslas haven’t experienced recalls and the truth is that they have been recalled. https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/tesla-recalls-2-million-vehicles-over-autopilot-issue-heres-what-you-need-to-know/ The recall affects these Autopilot-equipped models: 2012-2023 Model S vehicles. 2017-2023 Model 3 vehicles. 2016-2023 Model X vehicles. 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles. That’s nearly all the cars Tesla has sold in the US, according to The Washington Post. You can check whether your car is affected by plugging your vehicle identification number into the Tesla page or the NHTSA page. This so called recall was little more than a software update from Tesla via cell towers. But one might argue that it isn’t enough for Tesla to simply say “oopsie.” Most recalls only apply to individual parts of the car but the claimed self driving feature affects the entire vehicle and the safety of the public driving around it, not just that of the possibly irresponsible owner. Surely all such systems should meet rigorous safety standards and testing by the government itself. Time for a ban on full self drive and maybe those stupid disappearing door handles too? Trump is, after all, out to get Musk. “EU blocks China’s jet” It’s remarkable when you think about it. The Collective West, mostly under the direction of Washington, is trying to sabotage China’s development. Here it is passenger jetliners but you see it with communications equipment, satellites, computer chips, space exploration, etc. And yet with each attempt China just goes it’s own way and through their developments, may end up setting the standards for the 21st century. It will be a tough day for Boeing and Airbus when the Chinese have enough C919s for their own market and tell both those corporations that they are blocking planes from those corporations from their own skies on the grounds of “safety.” With Boeing going there way is been going i doubt ” ” will be needed as one certainly wonders about the safety of Boeing planes. Heard anything about that last crash investigation? (I’ve not) What will come of the air india crash investigation… youtube videos have raised some disturbing possibilities. The collective West never seems to grasp the fact that sanctions, especially if left in place for long periods, usually achieve the opposite of what is desired. The result is typically that the targeted country finds alternatives to whatever it was that the West formerly did. It develops its own domestic industry, it finds alternative customers, and so on. The West ultimately finds itself permanently irrelevant to the targeted country (and perhaps the rest of the world) with respect to whatever was being sanctioned. The targeted country thus becomes stronger and more self-sufficient, not weaker. ““This Bridge Shouldn’t Be Possible”: China Unveils World’s Highest Mega-Structure Now Ready to Open Above the Clouds” ‘Towering 947 feet higher than France’s renowned Millau Viaduct, this bridge is not just a transportation marvel but an emblem of architectural innovation. Built over a span of three years at a cost of $283 million, the bridge’s construction involved cutting-edge technology and meticulous planning.’ Only $283 million to build? While using cutting-edge technology? Can you imagine how much it would cost to build such a bridge in the west and how many years that it would take? Do the Chinese get to build it so cheap as there are not so many beaks being dipped? Although that bridge appears to be real (quick search shows corroborating articles at a number of websites), Sustainability Times is an AI slop farm. If I were interested enough to want to know more facts about it I’d probably start elsewhere… Yes, the entire article, including the ‘photo’ is AI slop. The structure is a suspension bridge – a very lightweight structure that seems to be justified solely as a tourist attraction. It’s in a very remote location and has almost no economic justification apart from the vague assumption that millions of tourists will come and see it. Guizhou province is poor and remote and for some odd reason has become obsessed with bridge building. They’ve spent billions on these bridges (10 of the highest bridges in the world are in Guizhou), claiming that all the traffic and tourists will somehow generate enough money to pay for it all. No doubt the citizens of Guizhou (or whoever is on the hook for all this money) are hoping that this all works out. According to this peer reviewed article in Nature, the economic justification was releasing a lot of economic potential in the region and being a significant part of getting rid of powerty. Apparently the rural places being more connected has generated 110-140 billion worth of economic activity annually. I suggest you read the study. it doesn’t say what you think it does. It is simply laying out a theoretical framework for assessing how to analyse the economic impact of infrastructure using Guizhou and its bridges as an example. Regional economics journals are full of this type of model making. It says nothing about CBA for those projects, thats a different type of assessment. Throwing around random figures for economic generation is standard justification for big infrastructure projects in all countries, you can pretty much come up with any number you want by adjusting a few variable inputs and outputs. I’ve never yet seen a road, bridge, or railway proposal that hasn’t been justified by its supposed indirect economic benefits – often derived by putting random economic values on someone being able to drive to McDonalds a bit quicker. Whether the benefits are real or not is the question and there is little consensus among infrastructure planners as to how to do this. well, scepticism aside, it is a bloody big, beautiful bridge which enables people to get places, strategically situated in the south-east of China, therefore in a region where transport towards the growing economies of south-east Asia is valuable. I don’t think that comments about “being able to drive to McDonalds” count as much more than cheap jibes. I’d say the Chinese government could have put their money into much less desirable projects. The USA way would be spending even more money on even less useful thing, on a private property of some billionaire (or just dump money into Pentagon). Looking at everything trough the profit is why the Western civilisation as we know it won’t live to see the end of this century. P.S. If Trump and Musk were still together, they would probably promise even bigger and better bridge, on Mars, for an affordable price of one hundred billion dollars. It’s definitely a weird article about the bridge. The image admits to being AI generated and my first thought was that the design shown made no sense for a bridge with dimensions indicated. Here’s a link that seems to have real images. https://english.news.cn/20250608/86962626fb8e4a899a1793dae24fc103/c.html I didn’t find any link that indicated the bridge is open yet, though it seems to be nearly completed. It says right below the picture (not a photo), AI generated. It also says that it is an illustration of a specific bridge, that is has no resemblance to. So here’s where AI got it’s ‘bridge sense”?: https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res70/203000/203060-Bixby-Bridge.jpg That’s the Big Sur coastline and the bridge was built in the 1930’s with caste-in-place concrete. So, AI generated “cast-in-place concrete” bridge image, for a text that says “built with steel trusses”, “massive concrete towers”, “glass walkway suspended”. :) @RevKev perhaps you’ve heard of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge? The one that fell down in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake and was judged to be cheaper to replace than to retrofit (originally estimated at $250M)? It was completed in 2013 for $6.5 billion. 24 years, 2.5 km long and 160 m tall. Frick says the current $6.5 billion total is a rough estimate, and that it doesn’t include interest or financing costs. With those costs included, some expect the total price to double yet again—to $13 billion https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-13/how-the-cost-of-remaking-the-san-francisco-bay-bridge-soared-to-6-5-billion On top of that, the old Bay bridge was designed to support two commuter train lines. These were ripped out to make way for more cars, but the load bearing capacity was there. The new bridge section? Cars only. One of today’s linked articles point to a much larger issue than you would suspect from the headline: “Cardinal says race to exploit Africa’s resources is the origin of armed conflict”. The larger issue is the continued argument for an ecological conversion that started under Pope Francis. File under Climate/Environment: The bishops’ conferences and councils from Asia, Africa and Latin America (SECAM, CELAM and FABC) and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America publish a document calling for climate justice and ecological conversion in light of the UN climate change conference, COP30, which will take place in November in Brazil. https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2025-07/bishops-conferences-ecological-conversion-press-office-vatican.html The joint document presented by bishops of the global south titled, “A call for climate justice and the common home: ecological conversion, transformation and resistance to false solutions,” makes the case for “the Church’s commitment to climate justice and calls nations and governments to action,” as the world prepares for the COP30 in Brazil later this year. The document, shared with Pope Leo XVI, challenges the world’s powerful with ten “commitments and responsibilities” and presents ten specific demands coupled with calls to action, including the Church’s own efforts. The document itself can be found here through a linked PDF. https://www.sjesjesuits.global/2025/07/02/a-call-for-climate-justice-and-the-common-home/ Unfortunately I wasn’t able to read the PDF since I am on a mobile phone, but I was particularly interested in this quote from another article: It calls for economic degrowth, reduction in the demand for materials and goods, and their reuse and recycling. For example, recycling e-waste can help extract critical minerals and reduce the need to mine. It urges the phasing out of fossil fuels, a halt to deforestation and calls for ending the financialization of nature through carbon credits that grant immunity to wealthy asset-owning polluters, who put pressure on resources and the lives of vulnerable groups. https://www.ucanews.com/news/global-south-churches-call-for-ecological-conversion-ahead-of-cop30/109513#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17518086094890&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ucanews.com%2Fnews%2Fglobal-south-churches-call-for-ecological-conversion-ahead-of-cop30%2F109513 saludos The EU refuses to certify China’s C919 aircraft. Meanwhile, China’s C929 and C939 aircraft are just around the corner. These aircraft might prove to be both qualitative and price competitive with Boeing and Airbus, and they are nearly all made with Chinese ingredients. And airlines in Asia, South America, and Africa are more concerned about price than brand names. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqH4N1YlUz0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynik56MdU-I There may be some legal challenges before the C919 is sold outside of China, based on past history of plane makers. Highlights of the 17-year Airbus, Boeing trade war June 15 2021(Reuters) – The United States and the European Union on Wednesday announced a truce in their epic 17-year-old transatlantic battle over aircraft subsidies, hitting the pause button on the world’s largest corporate trade dispute. Canada illegally subsidized Bombardier: Embraer January 26, 2018 RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) – Brazilian planemaker Embraer said on Friday that the U.S. Department of Commerce has shown that the Canadian government “heavily and illegally subsidized” Bombardier and its C Series aircraft, allowing the company to survive and distorting the aviation industry. The statement came just after Bombardier won an unexpected trade victory against U.S. planemaker Boeing Co when a U.S. agency rejected imposing hefty duties on sales of Bombardier’s new CSeries jet to American carriers. The EU is not refusing to certify the C919. They have said it would take 3-6 years to certify, which is not unexpected given that it is a ‘de novo’ application, which is very rare – usually they are started in conjunction with domestic certification bodies and EASA/FAA. Certification is very time consuming as it involves full checks on the entire supply chain – for whatever reason, Comac thought they could just wheel up to Europe and ask for certification (they have not applied for FAA certification). When Embraer and Mitsubishi developed commercial aircraft independently they did joint domestic/EASA/FAA certification processes – this usually takes around 2 years after the first flight, assuming that the actual checking of design and parts was being done well before this. EASA took around 5 years (from first flight to 2012) to certify the Sukhoi S100 – this was done jointly with Russia authorities at the time. The C929 and C939 exist as press releases and models only. The C929 was formerly a joint project with Russia which they played around with for more than a decade before it fell apart, now China is going it alone. Nobody expects to see one flying before 2029 at the very earliest, and even that is dubious. There is almost no information available on the C939 beyond a few very vague press releases. C919 was certified in China 2023 and COMAC has worked with EASA towards certification since 2020 (and EU-China Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement). C919 core parts have already been certified by EASA (as per the video). Even the EASA executive director Florian Guillermet admits that normal certification time is 1 to 2 years, but with C919 they will need 7 to 10 years. All the while there are a few dozen of them flying regularly in China. And about 10,000 Boeing all over the world with Chinese parts in them. Given that COMAC will be busy until 2035 (or so) filling just the domestic orders, this will probably not be a biggie for them, but I can assume European manufacturers may start to face unforeseen obstacles in the Chinese markets soon. It’s kinda hard for EASA to approve an application that hasn’t even been formally submitted yet – the discussions so far appear to have been entirely informal (this at least, seems to have been EASA’s understanding – no doubt Comac thought otherwise). The usual process is for joint certification with national bodies (such as with the Sukhoi, Mitsubishi and Embraer aircraft), and this process starts at an early design stage. For whatever reason, Comac did not seek a joint process and appears to have believed that ongoing discussions constituted part of a certification process, and have now been told otherwise. The 1-2 year time period applies as the period between when a prototype flies and final certification, but this is only the end point of a longer process – the A380 for example, took around 2 years after its first flight to certification, the Superjet took longer. EASA is statutorily responsible for the safety of all aircraft flying in Europe. It has no obligation to make life easy for applicants. Comac could have started the process years ago, but failed to do so, probably because they were entirely focused on the Asian market. It’s also possible that, being newbies to this business, they were entirely unaware of how the process works and the French, being French, didn’t bother to inform them they were doing it wrong. “US/Israel Versus Iran – Round One” Everybody knows that the Israelis are going to go for another try as how dare Iran shoot back. So of course there is going to be a propaganda war to say that the US has to attack Iran again to protect democracy or freedom or mom’s apple pie. But there may be a major spanner appearing to make things harder- ‘Conservative American journalist Tucker Carlson has announced that he will air an interview with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, saying Americans deserve to hear directly from the leader of the country their military has recently fought. In a short video on X, Carlson said the conversation, which was conducted remotely through a translator, will be released “in a day or two.” He acknowledged that he will be criticized for the interview, saying: “Why did we do it anyway? Well, we did it because we were just at war with Iran 10 days ago and maybe again.” He argued that Americans have “the constitutional right and the God-given right to all the information they can gather about matters that affect them,” including hearing the views of adversaries.’ https://www.rt.com/news/621062-carlson-teases-interview-iranian-president/ So will Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham demand that Tucker Carlson have his citizenship or his passport revoked for this piece of “treason?” maybe charged with aiding and abetting the enemy? Thanks for the link Rev. Sometimes it seems as if Carlson is more flash than substance so it will be interesting to see what information comes from this interview. I for one was very afraid that there would be a false flag attack this past July 4th somewhere in America that would be blamed on Iran. It could be used to involve us in Iran. Fortunately it did not come to pass. It seems as though now the emphasis is on creating a proxy war using Azerbaijan and Armenia as foils. Larry Johnston has posted an analysis today on the situation there by David Davidian, an intelligence analyst who lives in Armenia. It is an area that I have little information about and I found it very helpful. It is called Armenia’s Prime Minister Is Trapped and has some needed information about the recent history of the region. It looks like a real problem for Iran and Russia. So! The ugly Americans in company of similarly disposed Brits and Israelis want to send US stuff into Baku? Who knows what can happen? As to US and Israel repeating the recent exchange, how much damage can Haifa and Ashdod endure? How soon before Iran runs out of targets in little Israel? How many B-2s could be claimed to fly next thumping a mountain in Iran? Quite fascinating how elites have lost control of the information system to a large extent in the last couple of decades. Can you imagine this interview happening under the old ABC/CBS/NBC regime? Not only do over the air stations require a federal license to operate but they are also gigantic for-profit corporations supported by other gigantic corporate advertisers. Thus there were plenty of levers available to prevent unwanted content from being available to Americans. Now however, a relatively small operation, or even one dude, can reach the entire US population with whatever he wants to say, and there isn’t much anyone can do about it. Of course this situation underlies the whole “fake news” panic we’ve seen in the last few years as the powers that be try to clamp down on information sources they don’t like. But overall the toothpaste doesn’t seem to be going back into the tube, and my impression is that Americans have largely lost their fear of unapproved people speaking out about whatever they want. This is a real victory for democracy (small d) and will doubtless underlie a lot of societal changes as we go forward. NC has followed the financialization, and corruption, of health care on several fronts. It looks like another Blue Cross/Blue Shield nonprofit, already being governed like a for profit company by the “right sort” of management, is going to finally be taken into the private sector, to seize the assets gained by its former nonprofit status. This is my interpretation of a complex story by LA Times reporter Laurence Darmiento: “Insurer Blue Shield of California’s new parent company alarms consumer advocates” Original story: https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-30/blue-shield-of-california-delaware-restructuring-charitable-obligations Archived story: https://archive.ph/0ZTTj I take an interest in this sort of thing because years ago, something called “Catholic Healthcare Initiatives” or “CHI” took over a bunch of midwestern Catholic hospitals, including the local one. It trashed the local “St. Elizabeth’s” to the point where people who worked there that we knew socially told us to use the other major hospital system. The care at St. E’s had been very superior to the care in the other hospital system (also ostensibly nonprofit) whose CEO of the time flew in from the Bahamas for his 3 day a week job. (Nonprofits run by “the right sort of people” support wealth over service.) The care at St. E’s had been so superior because of a mentoring program for nurses, and staffing levels above those in the other hospital system. We had additional insight into the “trashing” because our family doctor was someone we originally encountered as a hospitalist at St. E’s. He was so good that we followed him when he set up a practice of his own. He too told us to use the other hospital system henceforth. My point in telling this much of the story: At one time there was on-line a fair amount of information about the management of CHI (now renamed CommonSpirit Health), that indicated that it was a nonprofit being run by an interlocking family dynasty that was mining it for “for-profit” like incomes and side hustles. I cannot find anything on-line about that now. But “nonprofit” governance is, nowdays, often a sham. I will vote for Democrats in 2026 if they ban religion and turn over every single Democratic strategist and neoliberal think tankie for the people to do with as they will. Otherwise they can all drop dead. I think in terms of overthrow the lot, but the means elude me, except in dreams. On the real estate article, “The number one reason most experts, myself included, don’t foresee a crash is simple: there just aren’t enough homes to go around. Mark Fleming, Chief Economist at First American, put it perfectly: “There’s just generally not enough supply. There are more people than housing inventory. It’s Econ 101.” And Lawrence Yun from NAR echoes this, stating, “…if there’s a shortage, prices simply cannot crash.” The author’s bias is selling real estate. While we may not be on the brink of Sept 2008, even with a shortage of properties available if the prices are beyond what can be paid, they won’t be. So maybe at the moment we are looking at stagnation. However, the author did not discuss the situation with insurance. The market softness in the SE and Western US could be related to the insurance issue. A little longer term (12 months even) and we might be looking at an economic contraction plus greater insurance pullback. Between less buyers than can afford to buy and fewer banks willing to loan (you’ll never see a bank put down a mortgage without insurance! ) we might see a contraction at least in the areas most impacted. Many of the old existing homes in the Northeast lie in the new flood zones. A Northward shift in the pattern of atmospheric river activity could devastate real estate in the Northeast. A quick look at parcel maps in several areas of the Northeast reveals a crazy quilt of parcels I would expect would be very difficult to develop and build new housing. Very long skinny parcels, long skinny triangular parcels, and random shape parcels predominate. “A trip through the America destroyed by ‘inevitable progress’’ Sadly true this article. Recently I was doing some research on Newark in New Jersey. When I found an address, I would look it up on Google StreetView to see what is there now after a century. Sometimes the original building was still there which was of interest but all too often there would be a vacant lot or wilderness or some such and you knew that a century ago that this would have been part of a neighborhood where families were living. Now long gone. RAND Paper AI a Revolution in Military Affairs got my attention as much as anything else revolutions in military affairs have a bad reputation. It does suggest that AI drive a vast spectrum of swarming cheap robots, drones and self driving vehicles. Selling SkyNet. Quantity has quality. The study recognizes AI can make information into knowledge but does not show how that is done better than the data automation evolutions already applied by militaries. Next goal of data services is knowledge to wisdom, which AI likely won’t provide. The report at least mentions “kill chain’, how to build SkyNet. > Next goal of data services is knowledge to wisdom, which AI likely won’t provide. The thought occurs that the training data for “wisdom” is quite thin at present. Maybe give it a few millennia. I had the relevant conversation about the evolution of IT probably 30 years ago. At the time data bases and networked search were primitive. RAND does not mention “wisdom” nor have I seen it as more like IT nirvana. I once skimmed the Book of Wisdom…. In a different setting discussing wisdom, theological thought is “wisdom is thinking like God”. RE: Texas floods Couple of things; 1) Amusing to watch the blame game for this disaster. 2) Wonder about Amfortas the Hippie – haven’t heard from him for a while. I think he’s in Texas but don’t remember what part. Hope he’s doing OK. He’s in the TX hill country and would probably be in the area but not sure if his land is close to any rivers and specifically the Guadalupe. If I’m reading the wikipedia maps right, he wouldn’t be in the Guadalupe watershed, but did get a lot of rain. Hope that he and his are OK. I am not amused by the commentary, especially coming from those who have taken a public oath to uphold the health of the citizens of this country…….no matter if they are MAGA, whatever creed, race, sex, whatever. https://x.com/Fynnderella1/status/1941567217155571958 The Texas Medical Board should immediately delicense or sanction this MD. This is absolutely evil. I sat by silent for years, far too long, as one MD after the other taunted and humiliated the unvaccinated COVID patients, spewed misinformation and hate, and refused to see unvaccinated patients or patients who were not “following the narrative”. That silence is now over. I will likely join numerous colleagues across the country today who are preparing a complaint to the Texas Medical Board en masse. It is one thing to make statements like this as a citizen. It is entirely different as a licensed, sworn by oath member of our profession. Social media has taken the consequences away from stupidity. We should all be civil toward one another at times of crisis. ESPECIALLY PHYSICIANS! I am done with this. The reputation of the profession is in tatters in no small degree because of antics like this. Literally published while the hunt for bodies goes on. Her colleagues in her own practice have already scrubbed her from their website. It is like she never existed. That is simply no longer good enough. What has happened to my profession? What has happened to the pediatricians, historically the most compassionate and humorous of all the specialties? > What has happened to my profession? Can’t speak for USians but I am profoundly disquieted by the number of medical doctors in the UK who, in a (perfectly understandable) quest to escape the increasingly rules-based and centralised “treatment pathways/protocols” (which are often politicised) are now using their day off to do part-time MBAs. COMPLETELY the wrong thing to do IMNSHO. My medical friends, who were thankfully ignorant of economic issues beforehand, now come out, indoctrinated with Neoclassical nonsense and adhere to the (demonstrably stupid since they don’t deal with opportunity costs) rules and diktats of NICE. They become “difficult” to talk to. I’ve become the “annoying f’witt” thanks to raising questions like “what happened to the THREE factors of production?” & “what’s the fundamental property of a BALANCE sheet?” Which they struggle to give a coherent answer to that is consistent with what has been drilled into them in their MBA course. They have inadvertently become part of the problem, definitely not part of the solution. They should study health informatics instead. My question is, are MDs always speaking as MDs, or are they allowed to express a personal opinion that seems to conflict with their public oath? I’ve known doctors who, away from the office, will talk about trying to get a patient for years to stop smoking and now the patient has lung cancer. And the doctor doesn’t speak sympathetically, calls him a fool, etc. But you know what? When the patient shows up at the hospital, the doctor treats him as well as any other patient. As far as I can tell, the posting was not made on the pediatric site, but on a personal one. I may be wrong, but if not, I may disagree with what she says, but it’s free speech, and she should not lose her job for expressing free speech. Unfortunately, if you look at the multiple threads she did this weekend, she was given multiple chances by colleagues to clarify. The photo on this tweet was not the worst. Not only did she not clarify, she actually doubled and tripled down. It reached truly awful proportions. After the hospital systems she worked with began being bombed with complaints, everything was scrubbed. I guess one of my mottos in life about online posting is if something is worthy of being scrubbed a few hours or days later, it is probably best not to post in the first place. In instances of extreme outrage, I have found it much better for all to unload personally on my trusted colleagues and not published to the world. Much of the time, with colleagues’ feedback, I learn that I am well and truly full of crap and being overwrought. And as you point out there is all kinds of locker room talk of venting frustrations amongst ourselves. It is sheer folly to put this type of discussion on social media Yes, there is free speech. However, there are consequences to free speech. She has every right to say whatever she wants. I have every right to notice that her thoughts are inconsistent with the ideals of the profession and she needs to be held accountable as an example for all. Please note, I did not say a word about her right to say anything. I do decry the social media stampede to this kind of thing. And I have every right, given what she freely said, to never send her, her group, or her hospital another patient until there is appropriate accountability. Why would I expose a single patient to this? As I have said, there was a time when professionals and doctors never said a word in public about their politics. This example is largely why…..although wishing death and harm on others is a bit extreme. There are some saying what about the MAGA who had all kinds of nastiness to say about LA? I would agree. I have searched in vain for several minutes today to find examples of MAGA oriented MDs calling for death and destruction while the fires were burning. I have been unsuccessful finding a single example. The complaint to the Texas Medical Board that you are considering joining is an example of squashing free speech. I’m not in the medical field, but I assume the Board could revoke her license or fine her, something like that. If that happens, then she is indeed being punished for her free speech. As it is, she seems to be getting quite a bit of sh*t from citizens, customers and her employers. This kind of blowback I can’t argue with, but I don’t believe a medical board should be involved unless it involves her actual handling of patients. Abusive or Disruptive Behavior: Engaging in public or private abusive or disruptive behavior towards the general citizenry, patients, their families, or other medical staff. Dishonorable Conduct: Engaging in conduct that is dishonorable or that reflects poorly on the medical profession Those are two of the six very broad categories of the Texas Medical Practice Act that are applicable to this situation. The other 4 are a bit more tangential. This is codified into law by the State Legislature of Texas. It has been signed by the Governor of Texas every single time there is any alteration. It is the law. Every applicant who gets a license in Texas must take a test demonstrating they have mastered the rules and statutes in the Texas Medical Practice Act. It is called the Texas Medical Jurisprudence Exam. I will also tell you that Texas has extremely lenient laws compared to other states. That being said, I have known Texas physicians to have big problems from much less infractions. The laws are very broad and written in such a way that the members of the Board have some leeway in deciding the gravity of the situation. This physician decided to do this in the middle of a national tragedy. I am not sure how much sympathy there will be for her. I will assert that you will find similar statutes in the books of every State of the Union. As was described to me by the Board member when I got my license 35 years ago, the medical license is a privilege not a right. It can and will be revoked for inappropriate behavior. It was reiterated to every young doctor in the room that the main issues with discipline were drugs, addictions, and inappropriate sexual conduct. But also if we by word or action caused great shame to the profession, there would be consequences. Freedom of speech is a right. And she exercised it. We all have that right. However, there is no right to a medical license. A medical license is a PRIVILEGE granted by the states and there are very specific laws and statutes that must be upheld to maintain the PRIVILEGE. The profession as a whole and each state individually has its own rules. Calling for harm to citizens and kids and families simply because of their political beliefs is entirely inappropriate, a breach of medical principles and ethics, a breach of the very foundational oath of the profession, and a breach of the laws enshrined in the Texas Medical Practice Act. FYI – There will be an investigation. From the Chairman of the Texas Medical Board – It is clear they see the same issues with the law that I and many others do. https://x.com/szaafran/status/1941712042022387749 I will go on to reiterate that there is a large contingent of physicians in America that are just sick and tired of this kind of thing and watching our profession dragged through the mud by those among us who thrive in drama and self-righteous behavior online. It is high time that something be done about this. This is the very definition of unprofessional behavior and is causing great problems with trust in our communities. Jacktish, the ancient and modern recognized professions – law, medicine, the clergy – as opposed to the trades, have always been held to a higher standard of social respect and approval. These professions deal with personal contracts, crises and attendant personal secrets. Losing public faith in their carrying out their public duties impartially would be fatal to the professions. imo. re: “I guess one of my mottos in life about online posting is if something is worthy of being scrubbed a few hours or days later, it is probably best not to post in the first place. ” One of the things I’ve drilled into my students, at least wrt their uni email accounts (and hopefully their private email accounts): do not post anything online or in an email that you would not want your grandmother to read or to see posted on the church bulletin board. That last sentence triggered a memory for me. I was reading about Scottish Regiments in the British Army of the 19th century who were very religious and whose orders were given in Gaelic rather than English. One threatened punishment to keep those jocks in line was that any punishment that they would receive in their Regiment would result in it being published and posted in their church back home. Very effective. Sir, a state institution must not infringe on political statement. Laughing and demeaning those who are dying and suffering is not a political statement. It is painful for me to realize that unfortunately in the USA, it has become the norm to engage in this type of thing – but it is not a sign of good judgement – but the most important thing – it is not in any way effective to convince others to join your ideas. And it certainly should not be done by those in my profession. It would have been one thing for her to state facts as she sees them. That is not what she did. The statement violated state laws regarding the conduct of physicians. Physicians consent, as a condition of being licensed, to restrict their behavior, including their speech. I’m not amused by pols covering their asses on this one. People have died. Better, I think, to be pissed off big time, and try to better understand how american capitalism continues to kill and kill and kill. I agree. Seems to me state and federal officials should have been well aware of the flood risk, but chose to ignore the risk and spend money elsewhere. https://theconversation.com/why-texas-hill-country-where-a-devastating-flood-killed-dozens-is-one-of-the-deadliest-places-in-the-us-for-flash-flooding-260555 That’s false. People in the area of the flood report getting MULTIPLE alerts on their cells many hours before the flood hit, and the warnings were clear that the risk was high. What a tragedy and sadly part and parcel of the new normal with these everlasting gobstopper 10-20 inch rain events being a feature… If a similar storm hit here, every last business along Hwy 198 would be underwater and then some, not to mention hundreds of homes. It would be just the storm’s effect locally, but everything falling as rain in the higher climes will come down muy pronto~ Now that ICE has a bigger budget than the FBI,DEA,the Marshal’s service and the ATF combined the fibbies will need to increase their focus on potential Domestic Violent Extremists while ICE will be adding Potential threats to America’s National Security interests. There’s plenty of “Potential” here for budgets and AI is the right tool to use to fully exploit that potential! False positives are a plus both because of budgets and the way it encourages people to stop saying mean things about our betters. On being repurposed to go after different groups, during the investigations by HUAC (the House Un-American Activities Committee) on the State Department, it went from hunting down communists to hunting down homosexuals under the guise of hunting down communists. Employees would come to the interviews with investigators thinking that they would be good Americans giving information about spies only to be shown pictures of themselves going into gay and lesbian bars and asked about that. It was started by Senator McCarthy’s aide Roy Cohn, who was homosexual. I’m always amazed (and I shouldn’t be by now) that people do not think about the future use and abuse of new laws and powers given to an administration. They can learn form Ukraine’s TCC on how to maximize their profits and still show some results… Hey, wait a minute. The Ukrainians employ snatch squads to grab future “recruits” off the streets – while ICE uses snatch squads to grab possible illegal emigrants off the streets. I’m seeing a similarity here. Next step – a Night and Fog decree like in 1940s Germany where people would go out in the dark and fog and would just disappear never to be seen again= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacht_und_Nebel https://reclaimthenet.org/doj-antitrust-lawsuit-trusted-news-initiative-big-tech-independent-media The US DOJ seems to be supporting an interesting selection of what appears to be rabid anti-vaxers. Interesting. That Chinese language video is yet another amusing example of Orientalism. People often forget that Edward Said’s famous eponymous work wasn’t just about how European imperialists used knowledge of the other as a technology of imperial control. It was also about how the colonized sometimes actively participate in their own self-orientalization. This amusing video relies on the confusion between graphemes, morphemes, and sememes to impress viewers for whom translation is necessary. The contrast between the familiar and the unfamiliar seems innocent enough but it subtly encourages identifying the familiar with a norm or standard. One would never guess from watching it that there is a long history in the 20th Century of debates among linguists concerning the viability of the very concept of “word.” Chinese language(s) underwent major transformation, predominantly in the 20th Century, following the invention of a national language, what we commonly call “Chinese” or “Mandarin Chinese” today. This transformation spanned everything from the grammatical to the lexical. Today, a lot of people are quick to criticize the PRC for “social engineering” policies, especially in places like the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. These people probably forgot, or didn’t know in the first place, that practically everything about modern China, starting from the national language, is the result of a “social engineering” project. I concluded she was just trying to sell her services as a tutor or some other such general-service linguist. It’s not easy to make money as a linguist when you’re competing with MT and LLMs. ‘Tears My Heart to Pieces’: North Carolina Braces for Medicaid Cuts (NY Times via archive.ph) President Trump’s domestic policy law jeopardizes plans to reopen one rural county’s hospital — and health coverage for hundreds of thousands of state residents.

Imagine if there was any urgency to reduce the spread of a level 3 biohazard in the middle of year six of the Pandemic, ha. The Schryver article above says Iran won “a major strategic victory” in the recent war with Israel. A few days ago, the strongly pro-Zionist Telegraph in the UK published new details of the damage done to Israeli military sites by the Iranian bombing, according to satellite data. Such information still cannot be published in Israel. https://archive.ph/cT1KO I wonder if the Russians and/or the Chinese were slipping the Iranians exact longitude & latitude coordinates of Israeli targets for maximum effect. I doubt the Russians would, under the current administration. The almost 2 million Israeli Jews of Russian ethnic background are still regarded as part of the global Russian population deserving of protection. My guess is that most of what Iran gets from Russia are defensive weapons. China may have fewer conflicted loyalties like this, however. Russia would have to remember though that World Likud regards Russia as an enemy of Israel. Why that would be I have no idea, especially as there are so many Russian-Israelis. Russia would remember how Israeli jets deliberately put a Russian Il-20 plane in the path of Syrian aerial defenses a coupla years ago leading it to be shot down with the deaths of 15 Russians. And they would remember how at the beginning of the Hamas war, over 1,000 Israelis who were fighting for the Ukraine had to pack up and return home. And more recently how the modus operandi of the Israeli attack on Iran resembled the Ukrainian attack on Russia’s bomber force. Apparently lots of ordinary Russians took note of that one as did the government. Chuck Schumer once said that so long as two bricks leaned against each other in America, that it would be loyal to Israel. I do not think that there is a similar feeling in Russia for them. Israel demands total loyalty. The USSR during the 1970s and 1980s started leaning toward the Arab cause despite having been the first country to recognize Israel earlier on. They (or, rather, their successor, the Russia Federation) still haven’t lived that down as far as the Likudniks go. And really any original sympathies the USSR had lay with the Israeli Labor Party, which has pretty much been rendered an irrelevancy since Begin and Sharon and Netanyahu started dominating the political scene. But Putin and Netanyahu do have some kind of ongoing relationship which is not entirely adversarial, in spite of the official positions of their governments being at odds in a number of serious ways. I forgot when posting this that the original ruling socialist party was Mapai, which eventually merged with some allied parties to form Labor. And apparently the party has recently rebranded themselves as the Democrats, a not very felicitous choice. “The almost 2 million Israeli Jews of Russian ethnic background…” Information in Wikipedia puts the proportion of citizens from Russian/former USSR at 15% — 1,557,698 people according to the latest figures. It is a lot, but still significantly below 2 million. Thanks for the correction. I was trying to quote from memory something Putin said recently when explaining why “guaranteeing Israel’s security” was important to Russia. Maybe he was exaggerating, or maybe the translation was inexact. Or, more likely, maybe it’s that my memory is not too great these days!

But of course, sadly, this interview sums up everything that is also wrong with the US antiwar left and which encapsulates its incompetence in certain areas.

Title: Brendan Moynihan: ‘GP said I was too young for bowel cancer...he was wrong’

LOYALTY CODE: The paper code cannot be redeemed when browsing in private/incognito mode. Please go to a normal browser window and enter the code there Brendan Moynihan was visiting the bathroom up to six times a day and all he was passing was blood. Still, he was dismissed by his doctor and repeatedly told that he was “too young” for bowel cancer, a cancer which can affect any part of the colon or rectum. His doctor was wrong. Brendan was diagnosed with stage two bowel cancer at 38 years old, and more than two years on from his recovery, he is dedicated to raising awareness and funds to fight against this disease. Talking to Irish Country Living over Zoom from his home in Sydney, Australia, he says it is a world away from his native homeland of Berrings, a rural townland near Ballincollig, Co Cork. He describes growing up in rural Cork with fondness – “I played Gaelic football, I played hurling, I was really sporty all my life.” After moving to Dublin to study at DCU, he then worked with Kerry Group for many years before moving to Australia on a career break. “I haven’t moved back. I’m here now 14 years,” he says. Brendan is talking to us during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month in Australia. Bowel cancer is Australia’s most deadly cancer for people aged 25-44 years old. It is also the second most common cause of cancer death in Ireland, with over 2,500 new cases of bowel cancer reported every year. There has been a rise in the diagnosis of younger people too. Figures from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland, which examined more than 25 years of data, highlighted that the incidence rate had doubled (up to 2019). Professor Ferga Gleeson, gastroenterologist at Blackrock Health Clinic, tells Irish Country Living that it is important for younger people to be aware of bowel cancer and its symptoms. Professor Ferga Gleeson, gastroenterologist at Blackrock Health Clinic. “There can be a tendency for some people to consider bowel cancer as a disease that only affects the older population, but we know that more and more young people are being diagnosed,” she says. “In many cases with younger patients, we are seeing people present with the more advanced forms of bowel cancer.” This is the myth that Brendan is keen to dispel in his advocacy: “bowel cancer is not an old man’s disease,” he says fervently. Struggle to get diagnosis When Brendan was diagnosed with bowel cancer at the end of 2022, he was living in Melbourne and had been experiencing extreme tiredness for several months. This is one of the symptoms of bowel cancer that can go overlooked. “I’m a runner,” says Brendan. “I run five days a week and I got to a point in August 2022 when I couldn’t run 500 metres. I just had no energy and that’s what prompted my first visit. “I visited my doctor over a six-month period and he dismissed me on five different occasions. He kept saying to me: ‘you’re too young’ for bowel cancer. Brendan completed the Melbourne Marathon in 2023 to raise funds for Bowel Cancer Australia. “That’s a big thing that needs to change all around the world. It affects people of all ages and it affects both genders.” Brendan went to a different doctor in December that year. “I got to a point where I was in so much agony, I wasn’t sleeping. I was unable to function at work.” It was Christmas week, and he remembers the visit clearly. “I knew by his body language and his tone as he listened to my story that I was in trouble.” In January 2023, Brendan underwent right hemicolectomy surgery [surgery that removes the ascending colon and part of the transverse colon] and about half of his large colon was removed. “What I know today is very different to being diagnosed because when the news was broken to me, I wasn’t even aware of bowel cancer. It was not on my radar at all.” It was difficult for Brendan being diagnosed with stage two bowel cancer with his family on the other side of the world but he says that the short time period between his diagnosis and operation made it easier. “I had such a short window to get my life in order. I was diagnosed on Christmas Eve and my first surgery was 9 January. I didn’t have time to stress about it, whereas my recovery and especially my time off work was a lot more challenging.” Although Brendan still goes for scans every six months, he considers himself “one of the lucky ones”. Everything was covered by his private health insurer and the tumour had not metastasised to other parts of the body. “Luckily they managed to remove everything that needed to come out through surgery. Provided I could pass stool naturally myself within a period of time, I could go home.” Fighting on Since his operation, Brendan has been heavily engaged in raising awareness of bowel cancer. He delivers talks, contributes to podcasts and recently shared his story on national TV in Australia. “I am an ambassador for Bowel Cancer Australia and our biggest initiative is called Never2Young. We go to Parliament every year to meet politicians and demand they do more.” Brendan shared his experience of bowel cancer on The Morning Show in Australia in June. Brendan also does his own fundraising for Bowel Cancer Australia through sponsored runs. “My goal is to raise $100,000/€55,000,” he says. Brendan works in brand management, and his employer, the Coca-Cola company, have donated $10,000/€5,500 to his fundraiser. With a working background in whiskey, Brendan also organised a big whiskey auction last year and raised $17,000/€9,000. “It’s kind of leaning into my network to spread the word and then leverage connections to get the money for bowel cancer,” he says. Brendan’s big message is to go for regular checks with your GP. “I think rural people have a tendency to say: oh, it will be grand. “If there’s something wrong health wise, go and speak to your doctor. Equally, if you’re not happy with what they tell you, get a second opinion because you know your body. It costs you nothing and you have everything to live for. “I love that more and more people are talking about this. I think rural people are less likely to openly talk about things like poo, as an example, but the more we’re aware and talking about it, the greater chance of catching this early.” Professor Gleeson also stresses that the earlier bowel cancer is detected, the better the outcomes. She highlights the importance of the national screening programme [people aged between 59 and 70 in Ireland are eligible for free bowel screening every two years] and a colonoscopy. “Bowel cancer oftens begins as a growth called a polyp, located inside the colon or rectum. Finding and removing polyps can prevent bowel cancer,” says Professor Gleeson. “A colonoscopy after an abnormal unexplained stool test is associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of cancer death. “If you are experiencing any unusual symptoms relating to your bowel that persist for a long period of time, you should visit your GP,” says Professor Gleeson. “If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed, it does not automatically mean that you have bowel cancer, but you should check with a medical professional who can discuss next steps with you.” Bowel cancer: know the symptoms In Ireland, the national BowelScreen programme also offers free bowel screening to people aged 59 to 70 every two years. Screening helps to detect bowel cancer at an early stage. People who wish to take part in the screening programme are sent a screening test kit in the post. The Irish Cancer Society have warned that bowel cancer screening uptake is going backwards and nationwide awareness needs to be increased. According to HSE data, only 2 in 5 people who were eligible to participate in BowelScreen actually took part. Ireland’s target uptake is just 45%, which is nowhere near the EU recommended bowel cancer screening target uptake of 65%. What are the symptoms of bowel cancer to look out for? B is blood in your stool. O is obvious changes to your bowel habit e.g. diarrhoea or constipation. W is unexplained weight loss. E is extreme tiredness. L is lumps in your stomach or your abdomen.

Now he is a proud ambassador for Bowel Cancer Australia. https://www.farmersjournal.ie/brendan-moynihan-gp-said-i-was-too-young-for-bowel-cancer-he-was-wrong-874478 Already registered?

Brendan Moynihan was visiting the bathroom up to six times a day and all he was passing was blood. Still, he was dismissed by his doctor and repeatedly told that he was “too young” for bowel cancer, a cancer which can affect any part of the colon or rectum. His doctor was wrong. Brendan was diagnosed with stage two bowel cancer at 38 years old, and more than two years on from his recovery, he is dedicated to raising awareness and funds to fight against this disease. Talking to Irish Country Living over Zoom from his home in Sydney, Australia, he says it is a world away from his native homeland of Berrings, a rural townland near Ballincollig, Co Cork. He describes growing up in rural Cork with fondness – “I played Gaelic football, I played hurling, I was really sporty all my life.” After moving to Dublin to study at DCU, he then worked with Kerry Group for many years before moving to Australia on a career break. “I haven’t moved back. I’m here now 14 years,” he says. Brendan is talking to us during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month in Australia. Bowel cancer is Australia’s most deadly cancer for people aged 25-44 years old. It is also the second most common cause of cancer death in Ireland, with over 2,500 new cases of bowel cancer reported every year. There has been a rise in the diagnosis of younger people too. Figures from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland, which examined more than 25 years of data, highlighted that the incidence rate had doubled (up to 2019). Professor Ferga Gleeson, gastroenterologist at Blackrock Health Clinic, tells Irish Country Living that it is important for younger people to be aware of bowel cancer and its symptoms. Professor Ferga Gleeson, gastroenterologist at Blackrock Health Clinic. “There can be a tendency for some people to consider bowel cancer as a disease that only affects the older population, but we know that more and more young people are being diagnosed,” she says. “In many cases with younger patients, we are seeing people present with the more advanced forms of bowel cancer.” This is the myth that Brendan is keen to dispel in his advocacy: “bowel cancer is not an old man’s disease,” he says fervently. Struggle to get diagnosis When Brendan was diagnosed with bowel cancer at the end of 2022, he was living in Melbourne and had been experiencing extreme tiredness for several months. This is one of the symptoms of bowel cancer that can go overlooked. “I’m a runner,” says Brendan. “I run five days a week and I got to a point in August 2022 when I couldn’t run 500 metres. I just had no energy and that’s what prompted my first visit. “I visited my doctor over a six-month period and he dismissed me on five different occasions. He kept saying to me: ‘you’re too young’ for bowel cancer. Brendan completed the Melbourne Marathon in 2023 to raise funds for Bowel Cancer Australia. “That’s a big thing that needs to change all around the world. It affects people of all ages and it affects both genders.” Brendan went to a different doctor in December that year. “I got to a point where I was in so much agony, I wasn’t sleeping. I was unable to function at work.” It was Christmas week, and he remembers the visit clearly. “I knew by his body language and his tone as he listened to my story that I was in trouble.” In January 2023, Brendan underwent right hemicolectomy surgery [surgery that removes the ascending colon and part of the transverse colon] and about half of his large colon was removed. “What I know today is very different to being diagnosed because when the news was broken to me, I wasn’t even aware of bowel cancer. It was not on my radar at all.” It was difficult for Brendan being diagnosed with stage two bowel cancer with his family on the other side of the world but he says that the short time period between his diagnosis and operation made it easier. “I had such a short window to get my life in order. I was diagnosed on Christmas Eve and my first surgery was 9 January. I didn’t have time to stress about it, whereas my recovery and especially my time off work was a lot more challenging.” Although Brendan still goes for scans every six months, he considers himself “one of the lucky ones”. Everything was covered by his private health insurer and the tumour had not metastasised to other parts of the body. “Luckily they managed to remove everything that needed to come out through surgery. Provided I could pass stool naturally myself within a period of time, I could go home.” Fighting on Since his operation, Brendan has been heavily engaged in raising awareness of bowel cancer. He delivers talks, contributes to podcasts and recently shared his story on national TV in Australia. “I am an ambassador for Bowel Cancer Australia and our biggest initiative is called Never2Young. We go to Parliament every year to meet politicians and demand they do more.” Brendan shared his experience of bowel cancer on The Morning Show in Australia in June. Brendan also does his own fundraising for Bowel Cancer Australia through sponsored runs. “My goal is to raise $100,000/€55,000,” he says. Brendan works in brand management, and his employer, the Coca-Cola company, have donated $10,000/€5,500 to his fundraiser. With a working background in whiskey, Brendan also organised a big whiskey auction last year and raised $17,000/€9,000. “It’s kind of leaning into my network to spread the word and then leverage connections to get the money for bowel cancer,” he says. Brendan’s big message is to go for regular checks with your GP. “I think rural people have a tendency to say: oh, it will be grand. “If there’s something wrong health wise, go and speak to your doctor. Equally, if you’re not happy with what they tell you, get a second opinion because you know your body. It costs you nothing and you have everything to live for. “I love that more and more people are talking about this. I think rural people are less likely to openly talk about things like poo, as an example, but the more we’re aware and talking about it, the greater chance of catching this early.” Professor Gleeson also stresses that the earlier bowel cancer is detected, the better the outcomes. She highlights the importance of the national screening programme [people aged between 59 and 70 in Ireland are eligible for free bowel screening every two years] and a colonoscopy. “Bowel cancer oftens begins as a growth called a polyp, located inside the colon or rectum. Finding and removing polyps can prevent bowel cancer,” says Professor Gleeson. “A colonoscopy after an abnormal unexplained stool test is associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of cancer death. “If you are experiencing any unusual symptoms relating to your bowel that persist for a long period of time, you should visit your GP,” says Professor Gleeson. “If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed, it does not automatically mean that you have bowel cancer, but you should check with a medical professional who can discuss next steps with you.” Bowel cancer: know the symptoms In Ireland, the national BowelScreen programme also offers free bowel screening to people aged 59 to 70 every two years.

Global developments will shape market sentiment in the coming week along with quarterly earnings. Among important events is the announcement of US-India trade deal. Along with US President Donald Trump’s move to inform trading partners about planned tariff rate. The US Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. The June 2025 quarter earnings season begins this week, with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. set to announce its results. On the IPO front, Travel Food Services’ public issue opens for subscription, and Crizac is set to debut on the stock exchanges. Back home, Indian equities ended last week in the red amid caution around the India-US trade deal, foreign capital outflows, and the start of the earnings season. The Nifty formed a small bearish candle on the weekly chart, suggesting a phase of consolidation after recent gains. Analysts expect the index to trade with a positive bias within the 25,200–25,700 range, with stock-specific action likely to drive market direction. Benchmark indices broke a two-day losing streak to settle higher on Friday but on a weekly basis the Nifty 50 and Sensex declined over 0.75%. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 55.70 points or 0.22% higher at 25,461, while the BSE Sensex closed 193.42 points or 0.23% up at 83,432.89. This week, the broader market indices outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty and Sensex experiencing declines after two consecutive weeks of gains. The Nifty Realty sector saw a significant drop of over 2%, making it the worst-performing sector of the week, with Macrotech Developers Ltd. and Brigade Developers leading the declines. Investor focus in the coming week will remain firmly on the uncertain India-US trade deal, with US President Donald Trump's July 9 deadline approaching. Despite months of negotiations, no breakthrough has been achieved, and it is expected that the deal will be announced in the coming week. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made it clear that India will not rush into any deal based on external deadlines, insisting that any agreement must be fully concluded and in the national interest. Markets are also preparing for the start of the fr=irst quarter earnings season. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Tata Elxsi Ltd. will report their results during the week, offering early insights into sector performance amid ongoing global demand concerns. Retail giant DMart is scheduled to announce its results on Friday. Apart from corporate earnings, India’s weekly foreign exchange reserves, will be released on Friday. While investors wait for US President Donald Trump’s move ahead of the deadline of July 9, they will also track US Federal Reserve's minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. US crude oil inventories will also be released on Wednesday. Additionally, the US will release the jobless claims data for the week ending July 5. UK will release its GDP date for the May. The primary market is set for a busy week with six new public issues lined up, including one major mainboard IPO and five SME offerings. The headline act is Travel Food Services, a Mumbai-based operator of airport lounges and quick-service restaurants across India and Malaysia. Its Rs 2,000 crore public issue opens on July 7, with a price band of Rs 1,045–1,100 per share. The offer comprises 1.82 crore existing shares, and investors must apply for a minimum of 13 shares. On the SME front, upcoming IPOs include GLEN Industries, Chemkart India, Smarten Power Systems, CFF Fluid Control, and Asston Pharmaceuticals. These smaller offerings aim to tap into investor appetite for niche, high-growth companies in specialised sectors. The listings provide a range of options for investors seeking opportunities outside of large-cap names. Several IPOs are also set to make their stock market debut this week. Pushpa Jewellers, Silky Overseas, Vandan Foods, Cedaar Textile, and Marc Loire will list on July 7. Crizac in the only main board listing in the week and will debut on July 9, followed by Cryogenic OGS and White Force on July 10, and Meta Infotech on July 11. The upcoming week is set to be active with various corporate actions, including several companies going ex-trade for dividends, bonus issues and rights issues. Investors looking to benefit from these actions should pay close attention to the ex-dates to ensure their eligibility. Key names in focus this week include HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., among others, all of which have record dates for final and special dividends coming up. Titan Co., JSW Steel Ltd., Mphasis Ltd., Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Apollo Tyres Ltd. and IDFC First Bank Ltd. are among the many stocks that will trade ex-dividend this week. Meghna Infracon Infrastructure Ltd., Alkosign Ltd., Dynamic Cables Ltd. and Roto Pumps Ltd. are scheduled to distribute bonus shares to their stakeholders, ahead of their respective record dates next week.

Title: The Force-Feeding of AI on an Unwilling Public

Time Published: 2025-07-06T06:19:41Z

A few months ago, I needed to send an email. But when I opened Microsoft Outlook, something had changed. Microsoft asked me to use Copilot to write my email. Copilot is my AI companion. (That’s the cute word they use.) Hey I don’t want a companion—especially not a fake AI buddy. I never asked for this. And what about the people receiving my emails? They don’t want this either. They want to hear from me, not a bot. How do I turn my companion off? After some trial-and-error, I found a way to disable Copilot. Phew! But a few days later, Microsoft surprised me again. It wouldn’t let me save an Excel file until I had agreed to new terms for my software account. Guess what? AI is now bundled into all of my Microsoft software. Even worse, Microsoft recently raised the price of its subscriptions by $3 per month to cover the additional AI benefits. I get to use my AI companion 60 times per month as part of the deal. But I don’t want to use it. I want to kill it. As you can see, I’ve never used this service. I still have all 60 credits unused. But I’m paying for it—because it’s now embedded into Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason. Most people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product. You never get to decide. Before proceeding let me ask a simple question: Has there ever been a major innovation that helped society, but only 8% of the public would pay for it? That’s never happened before in human history. Everybody wanted electricity in their homes. Everybody wanted a radio. Everybody wanted a phone. Everybody wanted a refrigerator. Everybody wanted a TV set. Everybody wanted the Internet. They wanted it. They paid for it. They enjoyed it. AI isn’t like that. People distrust it or even hate it—and more so with each passing month. So the purveyors must bundle it into current offerings, and force usage that way. There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and services, they can hide the losses on their income statement. That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more likely, loss) very easy to measure. Shareholders would complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address customer concerns. But if AI is bundled into existing businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker, even if the public is lukewarm or hostile. It’s like a restaurant selling granite rocks for dessert. Nobody will buy them or eat them—so the product fails miserably. But if a popular restaurant adds a dollar to the meal price, and gives every customer a rock with their bill—well, then they can say that: Every customer gets rocks for dessert. Every customer pays for it. Their business is more profitable because of the tasty granite rocks. This is how AI accounting works in Silicon Valley. And that’s why Google does something similar to Microsoft. They add AI to search results—you don’t get to choose. It’s force-feeding all over again. So these huge digital platforms can pretend that users have totally embraced the new tech. Shut up, buddy, and chew on your rock. This is how AI gets implemented everywhere. You don’t get to choose. You’re never asked. It just shows up. Now you have to deal with it. I don’t want AI customer service—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI responses to my Google searches—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI integrated into my software—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI sending me emails—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI music on Spotify—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI books on Amazon—but I don’t get a choice. If they gave people a choice, they would reject this tyranny masquerading as innovation. The AI business model would collapse overnight if they needed consumer opt-in. Just pass that law, and see how quickly the bots disappear. Customer surveys prove that. The survey cited above presented customers with descriptions of different refrigerators. When AI was added as a feature, people showed a preference for all the other models. The Wall Street Journal concludes that companies should “beware of promoting AI in products.” And it’s more than just products and services. People don’t even want AI in texts or documents of any sort. In an earlier day, customer feedback would discourage businesses from adding AI. But the dominant AI companies are huge quasi-monopolies. So they don’t ask, they don’t care—they just do it. Every day it gets more brazen. Meta is now planning to unleash bots on you in even more aggressive ways than Google or Microsoft. They are training AI bots to send you messages, whether you want them or not. And I know (from painful personal experience) that you cannot disable Facebook Messenger without shutting down your entire Facebook account. There’s a word for this. It’s called spam—and people hate it. But that’s the blight of the AI revolution. It looks like spam. It smells like spam. It tastes like spam. What happens if we decide to boycott AI? The sad truth is that we can’t. It’s already too powerful. If I wanted to boycott AI, I would need to give up My email account All Google searches My word processing software Also Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Amazon and many other online retailers Spotify and any other music streamer that allows it Contacting customer service at many companies Etc. etc. etc. That’s bad news—because most of us need some of those things to live and work. But it will soon get much worse. Just wait and see. The day will eventually come when… You want to see a doctor or nurse—but you will be forced to use the AI chatbot. You will desperately need counseling, but only AI will be available. You seek legal advice, and just get a bot. You apply for a job, but they give it to a bot instead. You need an emergency responder—police, firefighter, paramedic—but you can only reach a bot. We already know that they won’t let us choose. That’s already decided. So now the only question is how quickly they will remove the few remaining instances where humans deal with humans. Judging by the current situation, tech companies will move quickly. They don’t ask for permission. It just happens. What’s most shocking is that they have done all this before making AI reliable. Every day I hear accounts of stupid and ridiculous things coming from bots. You would think they would fix this mess before forcing AI on us. But here’s the harsh reality. They won’t fix it, because they don’t know how. Despite that, they will accelerate the force-feeding. There should be laws against this. There should be transparency laws. There should be opt-in laws. There should be liability laws. There should be IP laws. We’re lucky that AI bots don’t write the laws—at least not yet. We should take action before that happens. And if politicians won’t act, let’s turn to voter initiatives (which are binding in many places) or class-action suits or take other steps. I have a hunch that juries will be sympathetic to our plight. After all, they are getting force-fed too. Let me address a final question—which is the frequently mentioned argument that the US needs to develop AI as fast as possible to get there before the Chinese. I’m not sure where there is. But I’m happy to let China or other countries arrive at that unhappy destination while I wait behind and watch. I’m absolutely certain that getting there will be a matter of great regret. There might even be the last place you would want to be. So I’d rather it happened as far away from here as possible. Ted, you called it "spam." My term for it is far less polite. I'm off all social media. I refuse to use AI for my writing. When AI "overviews" come up on Google searches, I immediately skip past them to real sources. I opt out as much as one individual can. There are free alternatives to Microsoft Office and they don't have AI. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Ethereum ETF Inflows Remain Green Despite Price Struggles – Here Are The Numbers

Ethereum’s price performance over the past 48 hours has been relatively subdued, suggesting that the altcoin’s recent rally may be cooling. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has dipped by just over 1%, with Binance showing a 1.22% decline and CoinGecko reporting a slightly steeper 1.81% drop. Intraday trading activity has been confined to a narrow band between $2,478 and $2,555, according to data from CoinGecko. However, beneath the surface, a different narrative is unfolding with steady inflows into Ethereum-based Spot ETFs. According to updated data from on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, US-based Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of 36,439 ETH on July 4, valued at approximately $92.19 million. This builds on a solid showing the day prior on July 3, when daily net inflows into the ETFs totaled $148.57 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs were on a roll of inflows in the just concluded week, with the latest Friday inflow making up four days of inflows out of five. The only day of outflow was on Wednesday, July 2, when the ETFs witnessed a negative netflow of $1.82 million. The lion’s share of Friday’s inflows came from the iShares (BlackRock) Ethereum Trust, which added 32,987 ETH, equivalent to $83.46 million in value. The fund now holds a substantial 1.81 million ETH, worth over $4.57 billion. Despite the relatively flat market price, this continued accumulation shows the current state of institutional confidence in Ethereum. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust also added 3,105 ETH on the day, even as its larger sibling, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), recorded minor outflows of 77 ETH. Meanwhile, other players such as VanEck, Bitwise, and Fidelity have maintained positive inflow momentum across the week. Over a seven-day period, the total net inflow across all listed Ethereum ETFs stands at 76,892 ETH, equivalent to roughly $194.54 million. Technically, Ethereum is starting to move into a consolidation pattern with its price action in the past 48 hours. It’s hovering above support at $2,400 but below resistance in the $2,600 range. Over the past seven days, Ethereum has mostly moved in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,630, ending the week with a gain of roughly 4%. At the time of writing, Ethereum is up by 4.1% in the past seven days, according to data from CoinGecko. This outpaces Bitcoin’s 0.7% gain in the same timeframe. Interestingly, Ethereum price action is forming what looks like a wedge pattern, according to technical analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart. This analysis places emphasis on the resistance at $2,600, which could open up a rejection to another support level at $2,200. Many analysts are eyeing breakouts above $2,600 and $2,800 for a possible rally to $4,000, while a drop below $2,200 could trigger a pullback to the $1,750 area. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,515, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The Kyiv Independent lies incessantly - it's a mouthpiece for Zelensky or his military psyops. But, I do think this story has some validity to it as lying about it doesn't help much, and I can see that Blackrock would have made a profit had Biden remained in office, and so they ran away when Trump won instead. 1 posted on 07/05/2025 6:14:46 PM PDT by ransomnote [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ransomnote Blackrock didn’t get the outcome it wanted, and now the war will end.

Pluribus Unum Workers are anxious that artificial intelligence could wipe out their jobs as layoffs continue and employers are cautious about hiring. Tech executives, economists and other experts say that AI could automate mundane and tedious tasks and also create new roles. Tech companies that are cutting jobs and leaning more on artificial intelligence are also disrupting themselves.Amazon’s Chief Executive Andy Jassy said last month that he expects the e-commerce giant will shrink its workforce as employees “get efficiency gains from using AI extensively.”At Salesforce, a software company that helps businesses manage customer relationships, Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week that AI is already doing 30% to 50% of the company’s work.Other tech leaders have chimed in before. Earlier this year, Anthropic, an AI startup, flashed a big warning: AI could wipe out more than half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.Ready or not, AI is reshaping, displacing and creating new roles as technology’s impact on the job market ripples across multiple sectors. The AI frenzy has fueled a lot of anxiety from workers who fear their jobs could be automated. Roughly half of U.S. workers are worried about how AI may be used in the workplace in the future and few think AI will lead to more job opportunities in the long run, according to a Pew Research Center report.The heightened fear comes as major tech companies, such as Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and Meta cut workers, push for more efficiency and promote their AI tools.

Earlier this year, Anthropic, an AI startup, flashed a big warning: AI could wipe out more than half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.Ready or not, AI is reshaping, displacing and creating new roles as technology’s impact on the job market ripples across multiple sectors. The AI frenzy has fueled a lot of anxiety from workers who fear their jobs could be automated. Roughly half of U.S. workers are worried about how AI may be used in the workplace in the future and few think AI will lead to more job opportunities in the long run, according to a Pew Research Center report.The heightened fear comes as major tech companies, such as Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and Meta cut workers, push for more efficiency and promote their AI tools.

Title: Cork boss Ryan still sees room for improvement

Cork hurling manager Pat Ryan watched his side stride into the All-Ireland SHC final with a 20 point demolition of Dublin, but still sees room for improvement as he targets a 'perfect' performance in the final. The Rebels ran out 7-26 to 2-21 winners at Croke Park as Ryan’s men blew Dublin away with a second-half performance where they scored 3-13, restricting Dublin to 1-09. Alan Connolly claimed a hat-trick while Brian Hayes and Tim O'Mahony both hit the net twice as the Rebels secured their place in the All-Ireland final for the second year in a row. Speaking to RTÉ Sport after the game, Ryan admitted that he was pleased with the nature of his side’s victory but insisted that they will have to be better in the final if they’re to end their 20-year wait to lift the Liam MacCarthy Cup. "I’m delighted, we came up here to win, that was the key aim," he said. "We knew we were coming up against a formidable team after the way they played (against Limerick) and we prepared really well for them. "We knew the last three or four weeks have gone really well. We were disappointed by one or two injuries today that left us short but we did well. "But having said that, there were still areas that we weren’t happy with. Our efficiency wasn’t good enough, our tackles from behind weren’t good enough and we gave away one or two sloppy goals that we weren’t happy with. "That’s something that we’ll work on, everything needs to be perfect from now on. For an All-Ireland final it wasn’t perfect last year, so we need to be perfect in two weeks time. "You just can't take the foot off the pedal. We will train really well over the next two weeks, that's our plan and we’ll hopefully will go one better we did last year." Cork manager Pat Ryan still sees room for improvement, despite his side claiming a 20 point victory over Dublin in the All-Ireland SHC semi-final at Croke Park. pic.twitter.com/b6ZA16hGm0 Dublin rarely looked like repeating the shock victory they claimed over Limerick in the semi-final as Cork were comfortable throughout, but Ryan was unhappy with some of their play in the first-half. He explained: "We just tried to get back to what we were doing. I thought we probably didn't take our scores and left a couple of wides behind us and they got a lot of short puckouts against us where we were chasing the ball. "We just weren’t really tuned it. Fellas were looking to get scores as opposed to looking to get tackles, hooks and blocks." Meanwhile man of the match Connolly – who ended his day's work with 3-02 from just six shots on goal – felt the Rebels’ lightning-fast start was crucial. "Our goal was to have a good start and we got that," the Blackrock forward said. "We were a bit worried if it would dip going into half-time and it did a bit but we kept going. You look at the scoreboard and see it’s seven goals, we’re delighted with that win. "We work it as a team. We [the forwards] stop the ball going in and they [the defenders] keep the ball coming in. Savage ball coming in, but everyone played their part." When Dublin did threaten to work their way back into the game late in the first half, Connolly reckoned the Munster men’s solution was simple and effective. "We just scored a goal, like!" he told RTÉ Sport. A massive Cork crowd made its way to Croke Park for a semi-final that played out in front of a packed house. The red jerseys in the stands proved an inspiration to the men wearing them on the field of play. "It was a good performance, we’ve no doubt the Cork crowd will follow us again in two weeks’ time so we’re looking forward to that one," Connolly beamed.

Title: BlackRock Issues De-dollarization Warning, Says Rising Debt Levels Could Push Capital Outside US Borders: Report

Time Published: 2025-07-05T17:33:35Z
Full Content:
The largest asset manager in the world says the risk of a de-dollarization of the global economy has edged higher due to rising US debt levels. In a third-quarter fixed income outlook note seen by Reuters, BlackRock analysts say that growing government debt is weakening demand for key US assets like the dollar and long-dated Treasuries. While de-dollarization may be far-fetched, the analysts say the government’s fiscal situation is increasing that risk, especially following the passage of President Trump’s tax and spending bill, which is expected to add up to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next five years. Says BlackRock, “We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets.” The firm’s investment managers also warn that an increasing amount of government spending is being allocated to paying off interest on the debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the US is projected to spend 5.3% of its GDP – about 29% of all its revenue – on interest on the national debt by 2034. BlackRock says there may not be enough natural demand to scoop up the amount of debt the US is trying to sell, which could prop up yields and make its debt burden even worse. “Despite proposed spending cuts, deficits are still climbing – and more of that spending is now going toward interest payments… With foreign investors stepping back and the government issuing more than half a trillion dollars of debt weekly, the risk of private markets being unable to absorb this debt and consequently pushing government borrowing costs higher, is tangible.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: BlackRock drops Ukraine fund – Bloomberg
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621038-blackrock-drops-ukraine-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-05T15:36:02Z

US investment holding BlackRock stopped its search for investors to back a multi-billion dollar fund for rebuilding Ukraine earlier this year, Bloomberg has reported. Interest reportedly dropped after President Donald Trump retook the White House. The fund was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome next week. It had been close to securing backing from firms supported by the governments of Germany, Italy, and Poland, the outlet wrote on Saturday, citing anonymous sources. Nevertheless, BlackRock reportedly decided to shelve the talks early this year “due to a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty over Ukraine’s future,” after the US changed its stance towards Kiev under the current administration. Trump has long promised to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has sought avenues to reach a peace deal. He has also pushed European NATO allies to take over the burden of militarily supporting Ukraine. Earlier this week, Washington reportedly froze critical arms deliveries to Kiev to focus on replenishing its own stockpiles, although the US president has insisted some military aid still continues. The Trump administration “was a notable absence from the fund’s backers in December,” Bloomberg added. In March of last year, BlackRock vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand indicated that the Ukraine Development Fund was on track to secure at least $2.5 billion from private investors, countries and other grant lenders. A consortium of such investors could finance at least $15 billion towards reconstruction work in Ukraine, he said. However, a BlackRock spokesperson indicated that the firm is no longer engaged in “any active mandate” with Kiev, having finished its pro-bono consulting work with the Ukraine Development Fund last year, Bloomberg wrote. The investment firm, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. Moscow has repeatedly condemned foreign arms supplies to Kiev, arguing that they make pro-Ukrainian Western nations party to the conflict, which Russia views as a NATO proxy war. The Kremlin has stated that the recent freeze in US military aid to Kiev will accelerate settlement of the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

Title: CEOs Say AI Is Poised to Wipe Out an Astonishing Number of Jobs

Full Content:
Billionaire tech moguls aren't the only ones doomsaying about artificial intelligence layoffs. CEOs across a range of industries are now jumping on the bandwagon, saying it's no longer a matter of "if," but "how many" jobs AI will take. A recent survey by the Wall Street Journal explored just how pervasive the automation idea is throughout a number of industries, and execs aren't pulling any punches. For example, CEO of Ford Motor Company Jim Farley recently predicted that AI "is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the US." He added that "AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind." In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy spooked his employees with a memo saying to expect layoffs in the next few years because of the "once-in-a-lifetime" revolution of AI. And at JPMorgan Chase, CEO Marianne Lake recently told investors to expect the company's overall head count — and therefore its payroll expenses — to fall by as much as 10 percent over the next few years, thanks to the magic of AI. If the AI automation dystopia really is upon us, it evidently slipped under the radar of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which recently released its latest jobs report. Among other things, it found that the US added 147,000 jobs in June, slightly dropping the unemployment rate from 4.2 percent to 4.1 — and seemingly refuting the claim of an impending AI takeover, at least for now. Over half of these jobs, NBC notes, were in state and local government roles, while healthcare, social, service, and construction work made up the bulk of other gains. Still, there are some major issues buried in the data, like the fact that long-term unemployment — people unemployed for six months or more — has skyrocketed from 190,000 to a whopping 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of people unemployed at the median length of unemployment, 15 weeks or more, jumped from 34.9 percent to 38.3 percent. That level hasn't been seen since the throes of the pandemic, NBC notes. While those numbers are bad news — like, really bad — the crisis they point to is a little more complicated than an AI-powered dystopia. At their core, these numbers are arguably the result of our economy's dependence on unemployment laundered through AI hype. As economic researchers Jeffrey Funk and Gary Smith observed in a recent column, revenue from large language model (LLM) adoption is falling far short of the tech industry's promises. What gets presented as proof of AI's automation potential is instead a mash of penny-pinching layoffs, outsourcing, labor market saturation, and in some cases, employer bias against recent college grads. With that view in mind, all the CEO bluster looks less like an imminent crisis brought on by AI, and more like business as usual in a market economy. What workers do about that whole situation is another story altogether.

Title: One Big Beautiful Bill & Job Growth Send Stocks To New Highs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Continued job growth and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the One Beautiful Big Bill ... More Act (OBBBA) helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline looms as the next big hurdle this week. Better-than-expected job growth and the passage of US tax legislation propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs on Friday. Please note that the tax bill is named the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA), so no partisan political views are intended by using its name. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The resiliency of the labor market and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the OBBBA helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since the stocks bottomed, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. This data bolsters confidence in the view that the macroeconomic situation has been the primary driver of stocks so far this year. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks The S&P 500 reached an all-time high in the holiday-shortened week, now resting at 2.2% above its previous mid-February high after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 3.5% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. The strength in US bank stocks remains notable. The Federal Reserve recently revised its methodology, which will result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital means better profitability and the ability to return more capital to shareholders. In addition, banks are economically sensitive, so they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. Market Returns Employment grew by 147,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly higher, which is a positive. The household survey data was solid, with a gain of 93,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 751,000. The significant increase in the research series reverses much of the decline from the previous month. Monthly Job Growth Contrary to expectations, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. The decline was due to job gains of 93,000 in the household survey and a reduction of 130,000 in the labor force. US Unemployment Rate Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.8% last month. The average workweek hours were lower at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, hampered by weather and the LA fires. Workweek & Wages Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The improvement in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market has been resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Bottom line: The details of the jobs report were less impressive than the headline, but job growth was better than expected, and labor market health remains solid. Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. The better jobs data eliminated any chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is still expected in September. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Economic data releases are sparse this week. In addition, there are only two companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings. Now that the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA) has been signed into law, President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline should be the focus. While deals with Vietnam and the UK, as well as a détente with China, have been reached, the tariff levels of many large trading partners remain unsettled, barring a trade agreement. President Trump said letters are being sent to the countries notifying them of the effective tariff rate on their exports to the US, effective August 1, unless a trade deal is reached. Market participants will be keen to see if more trade deals are signed or if the possible economic drag from higher tariffs begins to weigh on the US economic outlook again. Stocks have reacted favorably to the better economic data and the likely boost from the tax cuts passed last week. The hurdles at these valuation levels are higher, but optimism about future corporate earnings has improved as economic downside risks have receded. Another spike in effective tariff rates around President Trump’s July 9 deadline could raise concerns about the economic headwinds increasing again, so increased volatility would not be unexpected.

Title: Tesla robotaxi incidents spark confusion and concerns in Austin

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two weeks into Tesla’s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety. Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who’ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses. The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver’s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles. Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it’s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they’re concerned about several incidents — documented on camera and shared on social media — where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who’ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla’s share price. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government. In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why. In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back. Some elected officials in Austin said they’re worried about the incidents. “There are just a lot of errors,” said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. “They have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.” And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn’t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government — which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust. “Tesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I’m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites’ safety,” she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla’s service halted for now. Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried. “We’ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,” he said. He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there. It’s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court. The Austin Police Department said in a statement: “As with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,” the department said. Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency “is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.” Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously. “I think that it’s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,” she said. Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 — the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law. Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company’s driver-assistance software. “I’ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,” she said. “I’ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.” Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla’s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear. Tesla’s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service. The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms. The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. “Take a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,” the person’s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment. Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service. “I was totally trusting of the technology,” she said in a YouTube video on her channel, “Ellie in Space.” She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car’s audio system to say that she couldn’t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.) Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla’s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach. “Elon must have a reason for why he believes in that,” she said. She’s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they’ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: “flawless,” “seamless” and “history-making.” But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren’t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand. Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla’s already-converted choir of supporters. Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google’s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla’s most enthusiastic fans are “all fairly convinced that it’s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don’t see it.” Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they’re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven. “What matters is not individual demonstrations. It’s statistics,” he said. Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 — six and a half years ago. Waymo began “rider only” rides in 2019. Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water. One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being “flooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. … The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.” The top comment on the post asked for a truce. “I want to see progress by both companies,” the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. “Waymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.” “I just want cars to drive themselves,” they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: 'Should I still consider a pension plan If I'm already investing?'

Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com I have been investing consistently since the beginning of 2025. I am 23 and I want to set myself up with the possibility of retiring early at the age of 55, living solely on my investments. My portfolio is composed thusly: Primarily ETFs consisting of S&P 500, STOX600, Vanguard FTSE All World ETF, and Gold. I also have speculative investments in the fields of nuclear power, quantum computing and to a lesser degree Cryptocurrency related stocks (MicroStrategy, Etoro, Webull, BlackRock, Coinbase, (without directly buying any cryptocurrency) I have done well for myself so far with a sizeable unrealised gain and frequent dividend payments. However, I have some queries which persist. Lately, I have been bombarded with emails and calls to sign up for a Private Pension Plan. In a way, I have my investment portfolio intended to cover my retirement expenses. Is there any benefit in investing in a pension plan instead/also? What is the catch? My second question revolves around taxes. Namely I understand that taxes are paid on any realised gains. Seeing that my investments are yielding unrealised gains, and any dividends gained are reinvested; what are my obligations regarding local taxes? My third question has to do with the fact that when I near my retirement age, I need to start liquidating my assets. How would you approach this matter? Would you liquidate a lump sum every year or withdraw money from the brokerage account gradually? My last question has to do with the brokerage application I use. I have in the past dabbled with some day trading on eToro. I have moved past trading to some disciplined Dollar Cost Averaging on Trading212. I find the interface of this application intuitive as it facilitates rebalancing and the stock purchases are commission free. Trading212 has long been touted as an ideal application for beginners. But I feel a consistent sense of insecurity on the long-term (up to retirement) sustainability of the application and how would my investments be affected if the platform goes bust. Regards, Disciplined Young Investor Dear Disciplined Young Investor, First of all—well done. Many people don’t even have such a goal, let alone by age 23. The fact that you’ve already thought about retiring at 55 and are investing consistently is a strong foundation. With a time horizon of 32 years, you’re giving yourself a real chance. Historically, by consistently applying DCA (dollar-cost averaging) into the market - especially something like the S&P 500 - you’re likely to see average returns of around 8–10% per year. You’ve set yourself up well. Your portfolio appears to be thoughtfully constructed. From what you've described, you’ve included a mix of broad-based ETFs such as the S&P 500, STOXX600, and Vanguard FTSE All World, along with some exposure to gold. This type of approach is often associated with diversification and relatively lower fees. Including a smaller allocation to sectors like nuclear energy, quantum computing, and crypto-related equities suggests that you've taken an interest in emerging industries as well. While every investor's approach will differ, having a clear strategy and awareness of your overall risk profile is always a good starting point. On your question about private pension plans—here’s the straight answer: There are two main advantages: 1. 25% tax credit (capped at €750/year as of the latest update - check for changes yearly). 2. Illiquidity: This may not seem like a benefit now, but the fact that you can’t access it until retirement actually protects you from dipping into it impulsively in the future - especially when life throws unexpected costs your way. But there are drawbacks too: Whether or not to open a private pension plan depends on your personal circumstances and long-term goals. While some individuals choose to include it as part of their broader financial planning (mainly to benefit from the tax credit and the structured approach it offers) others may prefer to continue investing independently. If it’s something you’re considering, I’d suggest reviewing the terms carefully, paying close attention to all fees involved, and seeking guidance from a licensed financial advisor before making any decisions. On the tax side, it is best to always consult with a licenced tax advisor in such case. As a Financial Coach I’m afraid I cannot help you much there. On withdrawals at retirement: You don’t need to worry too much about this now, but as you near your goal of retiring at 55 (or even before), the strategy will have to shift. When that time comes It is again best to consult with a licenced tax advisor specialised on investing to see what would make most sense to your portfolio at that point in time. And lastly: Trading212. I agree that it’s intuitive, low-fee, and great for DCA. But I do understand your concern about long-term sustainability. The key question to ask is whether the platform is regulated by a major authority—like the FCA (UK), or MFSA if local. If it is, your investments are technically held with a custodian, not the platform itself, meaning that if Trading212 ever goes bust, your holdings should remain safe. That said, it’s smart to stay updated on the platform’s status, and eventually—when your portfolio gets larger—you may want to consider splitting your funds across two platforms (or more), just as an added layer of protection.

For a while, it looked like the boom in deal activity that was expected after President Donald Trump retook the White House wouldn't happen. Companies pulled IPOs as the Liberation Day tariffs hit sentiment, while others put acquisition plans on hold. Deals, in short, dried up. But that seems to be changing. Deal activity is picking up for a host of reasons, experts say, among them Trump's retreat from some of his harsher tariff plans and increasing investor expectations that trade deals will be struck or tariffs at least kept at their baseline levels. Add to that a relatively resilient U.S. economy and record-high stock markets and you get a recipe for rising deal volume. IPO and M&A volumes are at their highest levels in years, according to Dealogic data, after years when high interest rates put a damper on things. In the first half of 2025, 174 companies raised more than $31 billion from U.S. IPOs, the most since 2021, when a record $200 billion of funds were raised in the same year-to-date period. U.S. M&A volume so far this year has already topped $989 billion, the highest level since 2021's record year, when there were $1.56 trillion in deals in the same period. Trump's Liberation Day tariffs hit stock markets and led companies like Swedish fintech Klarna to pause plans for IPOs. That's changing as investors are piling into tech and fintech firms, and investors are eyeing the possibility of interest-rate cuts in the second half that could keep stocks rising. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), has since seen its shares more than triple since its March listing. USDC stable coin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) was among June's IPO stars, benefiting from the increasing popularity of crytocurrencies and bitcoin; Israel-based retail trading platform eToro (ETOR) and space and defense tech firm Voyager Technologies (VOYG) were also among June's star listings. Circle and CoreWeave "in particular have been outstanding performers and a big driver of investor interest," said Dealogic’s Global ECM Head Samuel Kerr said. The pipeline of new deals is now building up again: In early July, design software maker Figma filed for an IPO. Here are 2025’s top five US IPOs ranked by funds raised, according to Dealogic. LNG exporter Venture Global (VG) raised $1.75 billion from its January IPO, the most by a listing so far this year in the U.S. and the most since Lineage's $5.1 billion listing in July last year. Unlike some more recent tech IPOs, its shares have lagged below their listing price. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), raised $1.57 billion from its listing on the Nasdaq in March. It had a tepid debut, but has since become one of this year's stars, trading more than three times above its $40 IPO price. SailPoint, a Texas-based cybersecurity company that private equity firm Thoma Bravo took private in 2022, made its return to public markets in February, raising $1.38 billion from its listing. Its shares continue to lag its $23 IPO price. Crypto firm Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has been one of this year's IPO stars, raising $1.21 billion from its IPO priced at $31 a share in June; the stablecoin issuer's stock is now around $189. The fifth-biggest IPO this year was the $994 million June offer by fintech firm Chime Financial. Its shares remain above their $27 IPO price. M&A volumes, which like IPOs took a hit this year, have been helped by enthusiasm for companies linked to artificial intelligence. “Although March brought a burst of large-cap deals, optimism faded in April after ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs sent shockwaves through the market," Mergermarket Head Lucinda Guthrie said. "Still, the opportunities presented by the volatility in the public markets drew attention from private capital. A key deal driver in 1H25 has been M&A to fuel the evolving AI landscape. " Here are the top M&A deals so far this year in the U.S, according to Dealogic, ranked by deal size, with No. 1, the funding round into ChatGPT maker OpenAI— illustrating the allure of AI investments. (All the deal volumes are excluding debt.) The ChatGPT maker raised $40 billion in new funding from a group of investors who took a 13.3% stake in a round led by SoftBank Group. Other investors included its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT). Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struck a $32 billion cash deal for cybersecurity startup Wiz in March that would be the tech giant’s largest acquisition ever. The deal hasn't closed yet. In June, Swiss building-materials company Holcim spun off its North American operations in a $28.7 billion deal. The Chicago-based cement and roofing provider started trading under the stock symbol (AMRZ). Charter Communications (CHTR) announced a $24.1 billion deal in May to buy privately held rival Cox Communications in a deal that would combine two of the U.S.'s largest cable providers. The deal has yet to close. Nuclear power producer Constellation Energy (CEG) agreed to buy private energy company Calpine for $17 billion excluding debt, a transaction that would create the largest clean energy provider in the U.S. The combined company would serve the AI boom, feeding the growing power needs of data centers.

Title: Elizabeth Plunkett: How murdered woman’s family discovered they were not ‘relevant victims’ in serial killer case

When something false is repeated often enough, it has a tendency to become accepted fact. At some point a seed of incorrect information takes root in the public discourse before spreading through newspaper articles, books and political statements. Eventually, the actual truth becomes almost impossible to discern. It is a phenomenon known to researchers as the illusory truth effect. The family of Elizabeth Plunkett came face to face with this effect in 2023 after getting a call from the Parole Board. Elizabeth was a 23-year-old woman from Ringsend in Dublin who, in 1976, was kidnapped and murdered by two English men. The killers, John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans, had come to Ireland with the aim of murdering one woman every week. A month after Elizabeth’s death, they murdered another young woman, Mary Duffy, from Co Galway, before being caught by gardaí and confessing to their crimes. Shaw and Evans became known as Ireland’s first serial killers. Both received life sentences and Evans died in custody in 2012 at the age of 72. Shaw (78) remains in Arbour Hill Prison. He is Ireland’s longest-serving prisoner. He sought to change that in 2023 by applying for parole, having already been granted release for two days a year. Under a new parole act passed in 2019, the Plunkett family had an automatic right to express their views on Shaw’s parole bid. When the family were contacted by the Parole Board, it was decided two of Elizabeth’s sisters, Bernadette Barry and Kathleen Nolan, would speak for all of the siblings. They spent hours drafting their submissions, explaining the ongoing trauma of Elizabeth’s murder and the effect it had on their parents who both died a few years afterwards. Shaw should not be released under any circumstances, they said. “I poured my heart and soul into that,” said Kathleen this week. “It was like slicing me open, with the trauma of remembering.” They repeated the process later in person during a meeting with two members of the Parole Board who would decide Shaw’s future. “We got emotional, we got angry – it was gruelling,” recalled Bernadette. Afterwards, the family put the matter to the back of their minds and prepared for the wedding of Kathleen’s daughter that summer. That August, the sisters got a call from the solicitors representing them in the parole process and were asked to come into the office on a Saturday morning. Their solicitor, James McGuill, informed them that the Parole Board had made a serious mistake. It had been discovered the Plunkett family were not “relevant victims” and therefore had no right to take part in Shaw’s parole process. This was because Shaw had in fact never been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder. Bernadette and Kathleen could not believe what they were hearing. For decades, newspaper articles and books had repeated the same “fact”: that John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans – “Ireland’s first serial killers” – were serving life for the murders of Elizabeth Plunkett and Mary Duffy. More than that, various State agencies were under the same impression. Over the years, every time Shaw or Evans was moved out of the prison, for example for hospital appointments, the Irish Prison Service (IPS) contacted the Plunkett family “as relevant victims” to let them know. Similarly, the Parole Board had contacted the family in the belief that Shaw had been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder, only to realise belatedly its mistake. “There’s retired judges on the Parole Board,” said Kathleen. “The highest echelons of Irish society get these jobs on these boards. They’re highly educated people, and yet no one checked this out.” How did this illusory truth take hold? A look through the archives provides a few clues. Shaw and Evans confessed to raping and murdering both women shortly after their capture. However, the prosecution was a convoluted affair. First, a judge granted a defence application that the men be tried separately, as each one was blaming the other for the murders. For reasons that remain unclear, the judge also ordered the men be given separate trials for each of the murdered women, meaning a total of four trials. The hearing began in July 1977, when Shaw went on trial for Mary Duffy’s rape and murder. To the surprise of many onlookers the jury became deadlocked on a verdict. He was retried and subsequently convicted. [ The late summer murders: Two men on a mission to kill Irish womenOpens in new window ] The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) then successfully appealed the original judgment mandating separate trials, meaning they could try Evans for both of the murders at the same time. Following the trial, he was convicted of Mary Duffy’s murder but, for reasons that are also unclear at this remove, the judge ordered the jury to find him not guilty of Elizabeth Plunkett’s killing. Both men were sentenced to life for Mary Duffy’s murder. Then, in 1979, the DPP dropped the charges against Shaw relating to Elizabeth’s rape and murder. To date, nothing has emerged to explain this decision. It is possible the DPP believed Shaw would never be released so there was no point in going through the expense of another trial. Like the rest of Irish society, Bernadette and Elizabeth, who were teenagers at the time, went through their life believing Shaw was in prison for their sister’s murder. They explained that during the trials, their father went to great lengths to shield the family from the trauma of the process. “The way it was in the house, it wasn’t discussed. My father would just shut down any conversation about it because it set my Mammy off. It was all about trying to keep us together because we were all ready to just lose the plot,” said Bernadette. “When you see somebody going to jail and there was a court case, you just automatically live your life thinking, yeah, they were found guilty,” said Kathleen. After being informed about the Parole Board’s mistake in August 2023, the sisters decided they would refuse to accept the label of “not relevant victims”. Their solicitor hired two barristers to examine the case. After searching through the records, the lawyers found that not only had there been no conviction for Elizabeth’s murder, no inquest had been held either. It would later emerge that a death certificate had not even been issued for the young woman. It felt like Elizabeth had been erased, the sisters said, and they were determined to address that. The sisters wrote to the Garda, the DPP and the Government but got nowhere. At that point they decided to go public and made contact with the RTÉ Documentary on One team, having been impressed by their investigation into abuse in Blackrock College. “I said to Kathleen: they’re meticulous. They have to be. Because they can’t afford to be sued after all the Ryan Tubridy thing,” joked Bernadette. The sisters have nothing but praise for the documentary team, and in particular its producer Liam O’Brien. Last month RTÉ started publishing a six-part podcast on the case called Stolen Sister. Earlier this year, thanks to the sisters’ campaign, an inquest was finally held into Elizabeth’s death which recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. However, officially, no one has been convicted of her death and the Plunkett family still have no say in Shaw’s parole. [ From the archive: State’s longest-serving prisoner in fresh bid to secure temporary releaseOpens in new window ] His last parole bid was rejected. He is expected to apply again early next year. James McGuill, their solicitor, has called on the Garda to reopen the murder investigation with a view to securing a murder conviction against Shaw. The Garda has said its investigation concluded in 1976 and the matter is one for the DPP. The family have received legal advice that, in rare cases, it is possible to reopen a case after charges are dropped. One path being pursued by McGuill and the two sisters is gathering enough new evidence to allow prosecutors to reopen the case. They have had some success to date. After the inquest, and particularly after the start of the RTÉ series, multiple women have come forward to say they believe they were also targeted by Shaw and Evans during the men’s 1976 crime spree. [ Eight women come forward with information on being targeted by 1976 killers of Elizabeth PlunkettOpens in new window ] This includes a woman who was knocked down by a car very close to where Elizabeth was abducted in Co Wicklow. These testimonies will be passed on to the Garda and DPP, McGuill said. Looking back, Kathleen says she can understand her father’s desire to protect them from the trial and why he “hid the newspapers behind the sideboard”. “When anyone would it bring up, he’d say: ‘Let Elizabeth Rest in peace’, because he couldn’t cope,” she said. Nevertheless, they are determined to keep up their campaign for Elizabeth’s case to be reopened by authorities. “They thought these two auld ones would just go away, said Bernadette. “But no, sorry, not when you’re fighting for your family.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Finding George Gibney: ‘I feel sad for 13-year-old me and nine-year-old Ber, who were not believed’

Time Published: 2025-07-05T05:00:00Z

Earlier this week, not long after The Irish Times had printed the story of George Gibney’s arrest in the United States under the headline “George Gibney facing 79 charges relating to alleged sexual abuse of four girls,” my phone pinged. “I am so glad. But feel sad for 13 yr old me and 9 yr old Ber, who were not believed,” it said. The text was from Tric, a talented swimmer, who had been one of six people involved in a case in Ireland against Gibney in the 1990s that was halted in the Supreme Court. The sentiment had nothing to do with self-pity but the name, the arrest, the charges hit hard, like an emotional jolt from the past. The broad outline of the allegation in the news story about Gibney’s US arrest was not dissimilar to the case involving Tric Kearney, Ber Carley and others. [ US government asks court to detain George Gibney until Irish extradition case is concludedOpens in new window ] The latest legal filings lodged in the US district court showed that Gibney had been accused of 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape over the alleged sexual abuse of four girls and the alleged attempted rape of one of the girls. Much like those allegations made decades ago, all four girls were minors, aged between eight and 15, and were coached by Gibney at the time of the alleged abuse. The text was a reminder that sometimes in the glare of headlines and the frenzy of how quickly news moves, how many charges are brought and how many people are involved, the human cost to nine- and 13-year-old girls can be forgotten. The original 1993 charges, at Dún Laoghaire District Court, were 27 counts of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge of young female swimmers under the age of 15. But no case was ever heard in Dublin. Gibney’s accusers have never had their day in court and that has been a devastating truth to live with and a source of deep frustration for more than 30 years. Gibney’s lawyer argued in an Irish Supreme Court judicial review at the time that he could not defend himself, as some of the allegations went back to the 1960s. It was true, some charges did go back that far. But some were also from the 1980s, just 11 years earlier. The line of defence that allegations reached too far back in time was an idea that became a dark in-joke to those involved in the case. It was simultaneously absurd and enraging. Gibney had introduced modern ways of training to his athletes. Before his name became synonymous with allegations of abuse, he was diligent and detailed and encouraged swimmers to keep meticulous diaries so that if they swam a national or event record, they could look back and see what training they had been doing to get the time. They kept their diaries. Following on from the Supreme Court ruling, Mr Justice Declan Costello in the High Court granted an order prohibiting the Director of Public Prosecutions, Eamonn Barnes, from proceeding with the charges against Gibney. Leave to appeal was granted but no appeal was made by the State. Gibney left Ireland when he was released in July 1994, a free and innocent man in the eyes of the courts. By then the Sunday Tribune (where I was working at the time), along with Gibney’s star swimmer of the time, Gary O’Toole, a double Olympian from Seoul and Barcelona, and European Championship silver medallist, had taken up the story and published details of the allegations against the coach. In an unusual request, all swimmers who were mentioned in the Sunday Tribune were asked for sworn affidavits and agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper’s defamation lawyer Hugh Mohan. For surety, more legal advice was taken from barrister and future Supreme Court judge Adrian Hardiman. The assumption was that Gibney would sue. But he did not. By the time the story was published he was already on the move and turned up in Warrender Baths Swimming Club in Scotland, working as a coach. Warrender, who had a medical doctor on their board, were horrified when informed of the allegations made in Ireland. By the end of 1994 Gibney was sacked and fled again, this time to the US. With an uncanny knack of moving and turning up at places where they needed a swimming coach, he emerged at the North Jeffco Swim Team in Arvada in Colorado in late 1995. He seemed to be endlessly landing on his feet. [ Why has it taken so long to arrest George Gibney in the US to enable extradition?Opens in new window ] People wondered how that could be before realising that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA), the then governing body of swimming in Ireland, had robustly defended Gibney and showed him astonishing deference. An example of that was in 1992, in what most people would have considered clear grounds for standing down Gibney as national coach. After the Barcelona Olympic Games in which O’Toole competed, he wrote to the Leinster Branch requesting a meeting them in December at the Ashling Hotel in Dublin, where he was accompanied by another swimmer, Chalkie White, and the husband of a female swimmer. O’Toole spoke first to the president Harry Kavanagh, the secretary Mary O’Malley and the treasurer Eddie Eaton, telling them he believed Gibney was a paedophile and had been sexually abusive to boys and girls for years. He advised them that the gardaí were involved and taking statements from various people and alleged that Gibney had tried to get into bed with him as a young swimmer before the young O’Toole garnered the strength to ask him to leave the room. The husband said to the Leinster Branch that his wife had been repeatedly sexually abused by Gibney and White alleged that as a boy he too had been molested by the coach. O’Toole urged the Leinster Branch to remove Gibney from Irish swimming and cancel a swimming course for 11- to 15-year-olds a few weeks later in early January. However, when Gibney was asked to step away, he threatened to sue the organisation. The juvenile course went ahead with Gibney in charge. Gibney was given life membership by the IASA in 1989 and despite the court case and the Sunday Tribune coverage, it was not rescinded until the beginning of 1997. The Sunday Tribune sent their story to Colorado and Gibney was moved again, this time to California, before settling in Florida. This week, with the arrest of the 77-year-old in Florida, the image of a younger Gibney standing at the pool deck with the large round glasses and goatee beard, the timing device slung around his neck like a stethoscope and the Sergio Tacchini polo shirt, has circled around and again brought people back in time – back to a small 25-metre swimming pool in Blackrock, Co Dublin, where a club called Trojan used to train. Trojan was where talented Irish swimmers wanted to be during the 1970s and 1980s, because Gibney was one of the best. It’s where he got his break after starting out working in swimming clubs at various pools around the Dublin area, including the Guinness pool, Marian and Waterford Crystal before moving to Glenalbyn in the early 1970s – a pool that is no longer functional, located beside the Kilmacud Crokes GAA club in the suburb of Stillorgan. A convincing, can-do coach, Gibney struck up close relationships with swimmers’ parents, easily gaining their trust, and by the mid-1970s Trojan was the top club in Ireland. He had a highly convincing personality and his CV was impressive. As well as being national director of swimming, he had published works on lactate testing in swimmers. He was a member of the National Training and Coaching Centre in Limerick University and the Irish Recreational Management Association, as well as an RTÉ Sports commentator for the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he rapidly rose through the swimming ranks in Ireland to become the Irish Olympic coach in 1988 for the Seoul Olympic Games and the IASA’s national director of swimming in 1991. But just three years after that appointment he was leaving everything he had created in Ireland. Behind were the accusers left to deal with an alleged abusive coach who they said had shattered their trust and altered their lives, a swimming association that turned away when their need was most desperate, and the rank failure of an Irish judicial system that had given process but, in their eyes, denied dignity or justice. Gibney might have been ducking and diving by state-hopping in the US, but because of the company he had kept at home, he was never far from the Irish public consciousness. By the end of 1997, Derry O’Rourke, who succeeded him as national coach, stood in the dock at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, where he pleaded guilty to 29 sample charges of sexual abuse against 11 young swimmers on numerous occasions between 1976 and 1992. Early the following year, O’Rourke, who used to try to hypnotise his swimmers, was jailed for 12 years by Judge Kieran O’Connor. O’Rourke’s investigation began in 1993, the year Frank McCann was formally charged with the murder of his wife, Esther McCann (née Leonard), and his 18-month-old foster-daughter Jessica McCann, when he set fire to their family home in Rathfarnham. The couple had been trying to adopt Jessica, but the process had been delayed, due to information gleaned by the adoption agency that McCann, president of the IASA Leinster Branch and a swimming coach, had fathered a child with a 17-year-old student. McCann is currently serving a life sentence in Arbour Hill Prison. It would take more than another decade but Ger Doyle, a successor to both Gibney and O’Rourke as national coach, would also find himself in the dock. In 2012, the 51-year-old from Wexford pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual assault and 34 charges of indecent assault at New Ross Swimming Pool between January 1981 and December 1993. The jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all charges. He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and released in 2015. To many people it beggared belief how so many figures involved at the higher levels of Irish swimming chimed so closely with allegations of child sexual abuse. But with the considerable attention and the constant pressure on the swimming association, the centre couldn’t hold, and the sport collapsed. The then minister for sport Jim McDaid stopped funding to the IASA in 1998 and set up what was ultimately an unsatisfactory inquiry, where witnesses were not compelled to attend and many did not. The Murphy Report was subsequently published in June 1998 and soon after the IASA was replaced with Swim Ireland. For many, that was the end, or at least a new beginning. But not for all. Several Irish news outlets, including the Irish Star, RTÉ’s Prime Time and the Sunday Tribune made journeys to Colorado, California, and Florida. They upset the tempo of Gibney’s life and made it uncomfortable, but didn’t move the dial regarding him answering the allegations made against him in Ireland. In 2016, Justine McCarthy, author of Deep Deception – Ireland’s Swimming Scandals and now an Irish Times columnist, reported that the Garda gave a certificate of character to George Gibney to support his application for his American visa, dated and stamped January 20th, 1992. [ For over 30 years, George Gibney has lived as a free man, without having to face a trialOpens in new window ] From the Dáil, Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan pressed home the need for a concerted approach from the police in Hillsborough County in Florida, where Gibney lived, and the Garda in Ireland. O’Sullivan’s letters followed the work of investigative journalist Irv Muchnick at the end of 2017. He had gone to the Californian courts in his case, Irvin Muchnick v United States Department of Homeland Security, seeking details of how Gibney had come to be in the US. He asked who had helped him with employment, who had written letters of comfort, and why, given his past, he had been allowed to remain a long-time resident alien in the country. Nobody knows exactly how much pressure the reporting, the door-stepping, court hearings in the US and letter writing to their congressional members put on the Irish State to act. In February 2018, The Second Captains released a 40-minute podcast called The George Gibney Case: 25 Years On. “The greatest illusion that was perpetrated in sport ever. There was nothing about that man that was real,” said O’Toole about his former coach Gibney. Second Captains producer Mark Horgan used the quote when he wrote a piece in The Irish Times in 2020 before the release of the 10-part podcast series Where is George Gibney? The big reaction to the 2018 piece pointed to real interest in the Gibney case and prompted them to consider a greater interrogation of the story. When Dylan Haskins, the commissioning executive for podcasts with BBC Sounds, was sold the idea for something more extensive and investigative, Horgan and Ciaran Cassidy hit the road. On and off for two-and-a-half years the pair travelled across the US, where they tracked down people who had previously stayed silent. They discovered new information on Gibney’s past and the path to where he resided in Florida’s Seminole county. During one of their visits to Florida, Horgan and Cassidy confronted Gibney outside his home. But he wouldn’t talk to them, wouldn’t listen, and awkwardly got into his car and drove away. “You couldn’t shut him up,” said Horgan. “That was, until the day he decided he’d never speak publicly again.” The silence and the voiceless shuffling of Gibney as questions were barked at him reached the ears of those swimmers who had not been part of the original 1990s case. Four came forward to make statements to gardaí alleging Gibney had sexually abused them between 1971 and 1981. By 2021, with the statements gathered, detectives at the Sexual Crime Management Unit had a criminal investigation and in May 2023 a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It directed that Gibney should face trial on 79 criminal charges; one charge of attempted rape and 78 of indecent assault. In the coming months, the outcome of the extradition and legal process in Ireland will be known. But already the four women who have made the allegations have gifted something those who went before them, something they have not had for many years. They have given them hope. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: If Institutions Are Buying Why Isn’t The Bitcoin Price Going Up?

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Matt Crosby Bitcoin price not soaring despite institutional billions? Uncover why profit-taking and derivatives hold it back, with a breakout looming! ETF inflows and institutional purchases continue to climb, yet many investors are puzzled by the muted Bitcoin price action. With billions flowing into BTC, why aren’t we seeing the price explode to new highs? The reality is more nuanced than it first appears. Looking at the ETF cumulative inflows chart (excluding GBTC outflows), it’s clear that demand from institutional players has been robust. Since the most recent pullback in late March, net ETF inflows have climbed from roughly 527,000 BTC to over 630,000 BTC, an increase of around 100,000 BTC in under 3 months. These are significant numbers, yet the Bitcoin price has largely mainly drifted sideways since the start of 2025. It’s important to remember that not all ETF flows represent “institutional” buying in the purest sense. Many ETF purchases come from client allocations, for example, family offices or high-net-worth individuals using platforms like BlackRock. Still, these flows matter, and the steady accumulation is a positive driver for long-term supply and demand dynamics. Complementing ETF inflows, corporate treasury buying has also been strong, with (Micro)Strategy leading the charge. MSTR alone have seen their holdings have jumped from roughly 528,000 BTC to over 592,000 BTC in this year alone. Across all treasury companies tracked, total holdings now exceed 823,000 BTC, representing an astounding $86 billion in value. Despite this, many market participants feel underwhelmed by price action compared to prior cycles. But we must contextualize expectations: the BTC market cap is now in the multi-trillion-dollar range. The sheer scale of capital required to drive exponential moves today dwarfs previous cycles. Comparing this cycle to the 10x returns of earlier eras isn’t realistic. In truth, BTC has more than doubled from $40K at the time of ETF launch to recent levels above $110K, a still monumental achievement for a maturing asset class. To understand why Bitcoin prices haven’t surged even further, we must examine selling behavior. By analyzing HODL Waves data for 1-5 year bands, we can quantify long-term holder profit-taking. Over the past three months, more than 240,000 BTC from these older bands has been distributed to the market, nearly a quarter-million BTC in net outflows. This selling has largely counterbalanced institutional accumulation. Given that daily miner issuance still adds another ~450 BTC to the market, we see why price has struggled to break higher: the market is in a state of supply-demand equilibrium. Meanwhile, open interest on BTC derivatives markets has exploded. From under $5B less than 3 years ago to over $25B today. Many new participants prefer are opting to trade “paper BTC” on derivatives rather than buying spot BTC, which reduces the positive influence on price of increased market participants. There is however now reason for optimism. Long-term holder selling is now decelerating, with recent net outflows falling below 1,000 BTC per day, a substantial reduction from previous monthly averages just weeks ago. If institutional inflows remain steady and retail demand starts to awaken, even at levels seen earlier this cycle rather than extreme prior peaks, we could easily see another powerful leg higher. Past instances show that when retail flows surge from these levels, BTC can double in price within months. ETF inflows and treasury purchases are pouring billions of dollars into Bitcoin, but the muted Bitcoin price reaction makes perfect sense when viewed through the lens of supply and demand. Heavy profit-taking by long-term holders and growing derivatives speculation have balanced out the inflows. As long-term selling subsides and institutional buying continues, the stage is being set for the next bullish impulse. Whether we see the euphoric retail mania of prior cycles remains to be seen, but even modest retail inflows combined with current institutional demand could drive prices sharply higher sooner rather than later.

Title: Fidelity snaps up 1% of all Bitcoin as institutional buying surges

Fidelity outpaces BlackRock in ETF inflows, but broader BTC demand slump limits upside momentum. U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (exchange-traded funds) are back with a bang, posting the second daily inflow of $601.94 million on the 3rd of July. However, the Fidelity BTC ETF fund (FBTC) has recently seen more aggressive demand than BlackRock’s IBIT. In fact, at press time, FBTC led inflows with $237.13 million, compared to IBIT’s $224.53 million, SoSo data showed. On the 2nd of July, FBTC also dominated the BTC ETFs, attracting $183 million of the overall $408 million inflows seen on that trading day. Source: SoSo Value Since Q2, the sustained inflows into FBTC have increased its holdings to 199,493 BTC as of 4th of July. This translates to $22 billion worth of net assets per current prices and 1.02% of the total BTC supply of 21 million coins. Fidelity’s BTC ETF growth is part of a broader surge in institutional accumulation from Q2. Notably, ETFs scooped 111,411 BTC in Q2, increasing their overall BTC stash by 8%. But public corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), bought more BTC (131K BTC) and grew their BTC stash by 18%. On the ETF side, Fidelity was second only to BlackRock’s IBIT in terms of total BTC holdings. IBIT had 692,887 BTC or 3.3% of the total BTC supply, as of the 4th of July. However, according to Fintel data compiled by AMBCrypto, IBIT saw higher institutional holder growth of 9% compared to FBTC’s 2.6% in early Q3. It meant more major institutional players like hedge funds and endowments piled on BlackRock than Fidelity. Source: Fintel However, overall share-holdings and capital allocation were down in early Q3, suggesting a trimmed position likely linked to recent quarter-end rebalancing or diversification. That said, the strong demand from ETFs and public treasuries has not managed to juice up the broader spot market demand. According to CryptoQuant, the apparent demand has dropped to 857K BTC despite ETFs and Strategy buying 748K BTC. Per the analytics firm, the broader contraction could cap BTC upside in the short term. “ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of Bitcoin demand; overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases, and the acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies.” Source: CryptoQuant As a result, CryptoQuant stated that although ETFs and Strategy’s buys were positive, they ‘are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs.’ The asset was valued at $108.8K, at press time, after tagging $110.5k on the 3rd of July.

Title: European ESG rebrand challenges NZ ethical investing norms – Fran O’Sullivan

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. European stock exchanges are redefining ESG to include defence under "energy, security and geostrategy". Photo / Getty Images THE FACTS New Zealand company directors take note: European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. In truth, the Europeans have had their collective ass handed to them by Donald Trump. The US President has strong-armed Nato members into increasing their defence budgets to 5% of GDP. However, the Europeans are determined their increased expenditure should boost their own defence companies – not simply be used to buy American military hardware and boost the profits of those American companies contributing to the US war machine. Back here, New Zealand companies have devoted thousands of pages in successive annual reports to trumpeting their prowess on environmental, social and governance metrics (traditional ESG). Some are required by law. Some frankly fall into “feel-good” box-ticking (often notable among failing companies!) and a deflection from a company’s true commercial driver, which is to post a profit and stay in business. It is time for a rethink. As with DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies, which even BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink (a previous champion) has walked away from, there is a sharpening of focus. At the Amsterdam Stock Exchange last week, chief executive René van Vlerken was quick to emphasise that the heightened geopolitical risks – obvious on Europe’s backdoor where the Russian-Ukraine conflict verges on a “forever war” – has made for the more existential approach. The Amsterdam exchange is part of the pan-European stock exchange Euronext, which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Portugal as well as the Netherlands. In May, Euronext’s chief executive and chairman Stephane Boujnah said the redefinition of ESG was in response to a “new geopolitical order”. “European aerospace and defence companies have expressed the urgent need to invest heavily in their innovation and production capacities to guarantee Europe’s strategic autonomy for the next decade,” Boujnah said. Euronext said it would revisit the methodologies for ESG indexes to limit the exclusions currently placed on defence companies. This poses a challenge for traditional ESG ratings agencies when it comes to advertising investments in defence industry-related bonds (for instance). It also has ramifications for entities like the New Zealand Super Fund and KiwiSaver funds, which walk a tightrope on definitions of ethical investing, with all sorts of activists getting exercised over where the funds invest. How will funds approach investing in New Zealand companies ranging from aerospace to quantum computing or drone manufacturing – all within the scope of the Government’s new defence plans – when there is a clear implication their products will be used in armed conflict? Euronext has said it will encourage the rating agencies to restrict the concept of controversial weapons solely to armament activities prohibited by relevant international treaties. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. I was in the Netherlands with 40 business leaders on the New Zealand Initiative think tank’s Go Dutch study tour, which was designed to provide insights from small, advanced economies. Fortuitously, our time in the Netherlands coincided with the Nato Summit in the Hague. It also coincided with the US attack on three nuclear facilities in Iran with “bunker buster” bombs and Tomahawk missiles, which made for frantic rebooking of flights back to New Zealand after some airlines pulled back from flying over the Middle East. Trump did attend Nato, being hosted overnight by the Dutch King and Queen in their personal palace before a truncated Nato meeting. At the summit, the allies made a commitment to investing 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements and defence and security-related spending by 2035. At least 3.5% of GDP was to fit within agreed definitions of Nato defence expenditure to resource core defence requirements and to meet Nato’s Capability Targets. The other 1.5% was to be invested in protecting critical infrastructure; defending networks; ensuring civil preparedness, resilience and innovation; and strengthening the defence industrial base. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was also in the Netherlands. He was the only political leader from the Indo-Pacific Four – Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand – to attend the Nato Summit. It was noted that he had turned up. Luxon contends he was under no pressure to increase New Zealand’s defence spending above the targeted 2% of GDP within the decade that was outlined in the recent Budget. But this is a more dangerous world. It was notable that when we visited Rotterdam – which hosts Europe’s largest port and some fully-automated container terminals – that the Dutch Ministry of Defence wants to acquire terminal capacity for handling multiple ships carrying military cargo (mainly equipment and ammunition) simultaneously. It has been agreed within Nato that this type of cargo can be transported via the Netherlands, even if the destination is outside the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, where older Dutch people still hold sharply to the lessons from the Nazi occupation in World War II – and where they have more recently been hurt by soaring energy prices sparked by the withdrawal of Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine – there is a quiet confidence. With 26% of land under sea level, the Netherlands has developed extensive water management systems, including dikes, dams and polders (land reclaimed from the sea) to manage the obvious risk. There is a frank realism there – we could do with a bit more here. Disclaimer: Fran O’Sullivan met her own costs to take part in the New Zealand Initiative’s Go Dutch study tour. These are her views.

Title: Trump pitches plan allowing farmers to vouch for illegal immigrant workers facing deportation

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 12:30:55 PM PDT by thegagline The Trump administration plans to implement a process whereby farmers in Iowa can vouch for hard-working, law-abiding migrant farmworkers who may be facing deportation, so that they can remain in the U.S. The proposed process was shared by President Donald Trump during an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday night, kicking off a year of patriotic celebrations meant to honor the nation’s 250th birthday. Trump said the new plan will take place in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and that legislation for the measure is currently being drafted while speaking Thursday evening from Iowa. “You know, they’ve had people working for them for years. And we’re going to do something … we’re going to sort of put the farmers in charge,” Trump told the crowd of people in attendance. “If a farmer has been with one of these people that worked so hard – they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that, but they work very hard, and they know him very well, and some of the farmers are literally, you know, they cry when they see this happen – if a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristie, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” “We don’t want to do [border security] where we take all of the workers off the farms,” Trump added. “We want the farms to do great.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Fraud and dishonesty is not exactly unheard of in this country right about now. “...they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that...” We can do that one day a year.....April 15th. I’m not a fan of this. Blackrock and liberals have been buying up farmland. Think they would fib to a feller? sponsorship means more to me than lip service. It means some skin in the game by all parties. one on the things in that agreement is no free stuff from the govt. a financial deposit and I am sure there are others. OH, Close enforcement of the agreement. How can Trump get away with amnesty just for farm workers? Sounds good to me. Every successful economy in history imports foreign workers. Some level of foreign workers are helpful, too many are harmful. We just need to find the correct balance of foreign workers. Awful, awful, awful! GOP at its worst. He needs to hear from us loud and clear! This is wrong, and we will have liberals accept large numbers this way. The law was and is broken. It’s a ridiculous - and frankly offensive - plan. If farmers can vouch for farmworkers, why can’t roofing companies vouch for roofers? And landscaping companies for landscapers? And, etc. If they’re so critical, put them under the farm workers visa program. All illegals should get the boot. Too many loopholes that will be exploited. Yeah, sure. Microsoft's Situation: Microsoft recently laid off a large number of employees (9,000, adding to previous layoffs totaling nearly 16,000). Around the same time, they reportedly applied for thousands of H-1B visas.IOW, Americans get laid off but let's hire foreigners. I don’t like it. Let them all self-deport and then apply for worker Visas, and come back.

The surge of Nvidia's market value is fueled by the AI race, as lot of companies are fighting over a share of the AI reserves, Nvidia is simply supplying weapons to all sides of the war. Though Nvidia has many AI models of its own, it isn't targeting endpoint consumers or making chatbots for everyday use. One of Nvidia's models, Nemotron‑4 (340B), is used to generate synthetic data used for training LLMs. Thanks to the increasing competition among tech giants to build the most advanced AI data centers, train cutting-edge models, and dominate the sector, Nvidia is cashing in. It supplies most of the chips used for these purposes. Just 2 weeks ago, Nvidia became the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.34 trillion. Hitting this new all-time high represents a ~17.4% growth from the $3.34 trillion market value we reported about 2 weeks ago. Unless the AI race slows down, Team Green is likely to keep seeing green. Fun fact: The world’s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, manages over $11.5 trillion in assets but has a market value of about $182.6 billion. CompaniesMarketCap.com

Title: The Graduate: A Slick BMW Boxer Bobber Built From R65 and R100 Parts

Time Published: 2025-07-04T17:01:01Z
Full Content:
You might not know Sam Clercx’s name, but you’ve seen his work. He launched his career at the tender age of 15 as an intern at Ironwood Motorcycles, under the guidance of Arjan van den Boom. He’s had a hand in many of the amazing machines that have graced our pages—and he’s learned a thing or two, judging by this beautifully executed BMW boxer bobber. “I was there with Arjan when he built the Mutant, and most of the other BMWs that put Ironwood on the map,” Sam tells us. “It was an extremely exciting time for me, as you can imagine. Most of my friends had jobs in supermarkets or cafés and I was helping build these amazing-looking and sounding custom bikes.” The niggles associated with classic motorcycles are partly why meneer van den Boom hit pause on Ironwood a few years ago. But Sam still has an affinity for the beloved BMW boxer motor. So he built up this R65 basket case as a side project, while completing another internship—this time at Motoism in Munich. “After Arjan closed up his shop and stopped building his boxers, I got a chance to buy a 1979 BMW R65 in parts, for cheap,” says Sam. “Thanks, in part, to Arjan and other people building wonderful machines out of these old R-series BMWs, the prices rose significantly, putting a nice riding rolling base out of my price range. I grabbed the opportunity and slowly started envisioning my perfect twin-valve custom.” “With a tight budget, but plenty of time, I picked up the neglected R65 in boxes. The short R65 frame and swingarm, paired with R100 cylinders, pistons, and heads, offered an affordable path to the quick, agile airhead I always wanted.” In stock form, the R100 makes about 25 hp more than the R65—so rebuilding the engine with R100 parts was a good call on Sam’s part. He also added BMW R100RS badges to the engine block to tease the engine’s true capacity, and adorned the heads with classic peanut covers. The airbox was swapped for pod filters, and the space it left behind was filled with a 3D-printed cover, housing a NOCO NLP9 battery. Sam scalped more R100 parts for the front end, fitting the lowered forks and twin Brembo brakes from a BMW R100RS. The R65 retains its drum brake and snowflake rims, which are now shod with Shinko E-270 tires. “It was a great help throughout the build to have a lot of spare parts from Arjan sitting in my garage,” he adds. “Small stuff like seals, throttle cables, and a lot of wiring—but also some nice bling parts.” A pair of aftermarket shocks props up the rear, connected to a custom-made stepped subframe. Lower down, the unsightly brackets that normally hold the mufflers and passenger pegs were trimmed down, leaving just enough space for the latter. “While style was obviously important, I didn’t want to sacrifice function,” Sam adds. “There are, of course, more practical bikes out there, but I set out to strike a balance between function and form: keeping it a two-seater and asking the talented Tom Hurley to make the seat as comfortable and waterproof as possible, while keeping it slim; adding tie-down points under the seat for my luggage; and fitting modern LEDs for good visibility at night, along with reliable electronics. I’m a rider first and a builder second.” Keeping with this philosophy, Sam fabricated a pair of short fenders for the bike and protected the fork stanchions with fresh rubber boots. A chromed LED headlight sits out front, nailing the mix of classic style and modern reliability that Sam was after. The headlight is neatly tucked into a 3D-printed fairing that was inspired by the plug-and-play fork covers that Motoism produces. It includes integrated Motoism turn signals, with a tidy housing for a slim Motogadget Motoscope Mini speedo up top. Other Motogadget bits include the bike’s keyless RFID ignition, and the company’s mo.unit blue module, around which the whole bike was rewired. The fairing also helps to route the cockpit’s cables and houses, making for an uber-neat setup. Wide handlebars sport vintage-style grips, a MessnerMoto throttle, and modern push-buttons with internal wiring. Tarozzi foot controls round out the control package. Motoism’s influence is clear in the BMW’s rear lighting too. Sam designed and 3D-printed his own taillight housing, equipping it with powerful LED internals. The rear turn signals are Motoism parts too, but the bracket that holds them is a one-off. The boxer’s glorious two-into-one exhaust headers were created by Sam’s good friend Chiel Nipius (of Nius Moto). They’re matched to a Spark silencer to create an appropriately throaty rumble. The most striking thing about this BMW boxer bobber is how well judged every last part and finish is—from the refinished motor to the period-correct pin striping and blacked-out tank roundels. “The color scheme was inspired by a picture of a classic Porsche 356 convertible I found—black leather, chrome silver, and this stunning blue,” explains Sam. “It was perfectly executed by Royal Kustom Works on the tank, fenders, and front fairing.” Now that his BMW R65/R100 is complete, Sam plans to take it on a few trips before selling it to make way for the next project. But first, it’s being exhibited as his official graduation project at the Utrecht School of the Arts. If it were up to us, we’d give him full marks.

Title: I’m a retiree with $900k cash but no home. How do I make it last? - Mary Holm

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. There's no need for your 80s to be sad. Photo / 123RF Q: I am a twice-married woman of 70. I have not come out of either marriage settlement well. For six years now, I’ve been living with a friend in a large, comfortable home. However, it is not a great situation and I really need to be out of it. My problem is that I have three children with families who all live in the Auckland area, and I would like to be located so that I can see them easily. They all lived offshore for a long time and now they are all here. I am so lucky. I have all up around $1 million, although $100,000 is on loan to my daughter to enable her to buy a home. My only income is the pension (I guess you’ve heard this all before!), but I am hopeful of living these next few years as I would like to live. Clearly, my 80s look sad. I am English-born, lived in Australia and met my Kiwi husband and moved to NZ. My 20-year marriage ended, and five years later I met my second husband. We had a business together which was successful, but he mismanaged our funds (he being the only director) and then left to live a nomadic life! My circumstances need to be addressed. I do not know if renting is wise as I’d hate to continually move, and my money would only allow me to buy something tiny anywhere near my only family in NZ. Is there any solution to this? I have been harbouring this problem for far too long, and I must move on. A: Let’s set you on a more positive path – not just for now but for your future. There’s no need for your 80s or beyond to be sad. I think renting, rather than tying up your savings in a small property that doesn’t appeal to you, is the way to go. You’ve got $900,000 available now. If you plan to live on that from now until you’re 90, you could spend $45,000 a year – in addition to NZ Super - even if you were earning no return on the savings. But if you earn 3% a year, after fees and tax, you could spend $60,000 a year – or $5000 a month - according to an online regular withdrawal calculator. What about when you’re 90? Many people report they can live comfortably on just NZ Super at that stage – although they tend to be homeowners. But by then, it would surely be reasonable for your daughter to repay your $100,000 loan, which you could use to supplement your Super. There are a few issues to consider here: If you prefer to just put the lot in bank deposits, your return would probably average above 2% a year after tax, and you could spend $4500 a month. You can make this work! Footnote 1: Cash-poor retired homeowners might want to consider selling their homes and renting in much the same way. Many people wouldn’t dream of doing that. But they would have considerably more spending money. Footnote 2: In your story, there is a message for other women whose husbands run the money side of a joint business: Be involved. Please. Q: I write regarding last week’s letter about landlords being charitable for too long and needing to raise rents. Landlords need to remember that their market is individuals with limits on what they can pay in rent. These individuals are not a charity to support indigent landlords. Of course, landlords can raise rents, but they may not find tenants. I see this in the apartment block where I own my home. Rents range from $500 per week for a studio to $750 for a two-bedroom. Lovely tenants moved out because the landlord raised the rent at lease renewal time. Apartments have been vacant for weeks until landlords got more realistic and reduced the asking price, in at least one case to below the previous rent. My renting neighbours are professionals on good incomes, the only people who can afford to rent here. I am a single superannuitant and could not afford to rent an apartment in my building. As an owner, my outgoings are around $6500 per annum, which I can afford. Obviously, a landlord’s outgoings also include mortgage repayments. But with the substantial rents my neighbours pay, I am surprised that landlords can’t cover their costs, particularly now that interest is tax-deductible. Possibly some landlords didn’t look carefully at risks and returns and are too highly geared, but I don’t see why tenants should pay for landlords’ poor business decisions. A: Your observations are interesting. A key factor in how well a rental property investment works for the landlord is the size of their mortgage. With no mortgage, most rents would easily cover expenses, but with a large mortgage, the interest payments can kill the short-term profitability. On the other hand, the bigger the mortgage, the bigger the long-term return the landlord stands to gain on their original investment – as long as property values rise. That’s the risk highly geared property investors take. Usually it works, or certainly has in the past. But if property values fall or stagnate, landlords with big mortgages they are struggling to pay are sometimes forced to sell at a loss. Expecting tenants to rescue them by paying rent above market rates is unrealistic. Q: You get lots of letters from landlords that focus on the social service they are doing by having properties that people can rent. There is no question that we need a stock of rental properties, but there are two points that many seem to miss. The first is that landlords, when they purchase properties to rent out, add demand to a limited supply of properties, and help raise the price. Secondly, when they threaten to leave the market, they will argue that there will be fewer properties for people to rent. That’s not true if the property is bought by another landlord. And if it’s bought by someone moving from rental to home ownership, then there is also one less person looking to rent. Unless they decide to leave the property vacant - highly unlikely - the total number of houses does not change when a landlord exits the market. A: You’re quite right on both points. If someone wants to own more than one house – so they can rent one property out – that must push up demand, and therefore prices. Several other readers also made your second point. One added that, if a previous tenant is able to buy a house from a landlord who has left the market, “from an overall societal perspective, this is a very good thing”. Also, she says, “I understand that the new healthy homes regulations are persuading some landlords to sell. Brilliant.” More on landlords and tenants next week. Q: Many years ago, I would read your weekly NZ Herald Q&A commentary (back in the days when the paper was known as conservative Granny Herald). Your bias against residential rental property was evident. You pushed for a capital gains tax and now quite possibly want a wealth tax in NZ. I also recall that your underlying views appeared to be somewhat socialist. Beyond this, I appreciate that you were giving advice to those who were not as financially literate as yourself. Over the many years my rental properties have appreciated in value, and now that, at retirement, I am mortgage-free, I have plenty of income and the benefit of capital gains. Also excellent long-term tenants and nicely renovated properties. Landlords have been particularly demonised in the last 10 or so years, and a culture of envy has developed against those who work to get ahead. We now have so many on a benefit (including NZ Super) that we have become unproductive as a nation. So the few work hard to support those who either don’t want to work or who can’t. I chanced upon an item online from your column back on February 24 last year asking the question, “Should we, the uber-rich and ‘chauffeured’!, be retiring ... at 85!” - whilst I was researching how I can financially help family by setting up a super fund for them, here and in Oz. Surely you are taking the mickey and invented this story? Otherwise, the couple must have dementia or cognitive impairment to write this nonsense to you. If, by some stretch of the imagination, there was some truth to what this couple wrote, the only purpose in publishing it was to engender envy and hatred, or dismay at best. It is great to stir the pot of green envy in NZ, as the left need the support of their “besties”, the media, including columns like yours, to further their agenda. Also, no wonder trust in the media, as revealed in recent polls, is at an all-time low, including distrust of our institutions and politicians, who also introduce legislation by stealth. Not to mention experts whose comments are all “politicised” today, and a left-biased judiciary and universities. Constant cherry-picking, an unbalanced distortion of the facts, running to their own narrative and pushing their agenda. There are still more than a few of us who are immune to all the propaganda and were educated in free thought. I do fear many will be departing our shores, though, given the push to greater socialism and redistribution of wealth in this country, and the racial divisions and subsequent erosion of democracy. A: Gosh. It must be hard being unhappy with beneficiaries, people who get NZ Super, the media, institutions and politicians, the judiciary and universities. You’ve well and truly broken the 200-word limit for letters, but you raise some interesting points. My comments: You acknowledge that some people can’t work. Along with setting up financial help for your family, it would be wonderful if you donated to charities that support these people. It might make you happier – I mean that sincerely. * Mary Holm, ONZM, is a freelance journalist, a seminar presenter and a bestselling author on personal finance.

Title: Nine Dividend Achiever Banks Raising Dividends After Passing the Fed's Stress Tests

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Several of the large banking institutions in the US passed the Stress Tests imposed by the Federal Reserve. As a result, they announced their intentions to raise dividends and boost buyback allocations. I went through the list of increases from last week, and focused on the institutions that have a ten year track record of annual dividend increases: I also added ten year charts showcasing the trends in share price, quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends. In order to understand equity returns, you need to decompose them to their sources. Equity returns are a function of: 1. Dividend Yields 2. Earnings Per Share Growth 3. Change in valuation In the long-run, the first two items (dividends and earnings per share) are the so called fundamental sources of returns. They drive the total return over periods longer than say a decade. The changes of valuation matter the least in the very long-run. In the short-run however, for periods of five to ten years or less, valuation does matter a lot. This is why your returns would be much different if you bought a company at a starting yield of 4% versus a starting yield of 2%. That being said, rising earnings and dividends matter a lot too, because they provide the needed fuel behind great returns in the long-run. However, if you manage to acquire a good company at a discount, your potential returns will be higher. Visualizing the interplay between dividend yields, earnings per share growth and the changes in valuation showcases where returns have come from perfectly well. It also provides the perspective to determine where we are today, and also to potentially provide some markers as to where a potential future buy point could be set at. Bank of America (BAC) hiked its quarterly dividend by 8% to $0.28/share. This will be the 12th year of consecutive annual dividend increases for this dividend achiever. The company has managed to grow dividends at an annualized rate of 8.70% over the past five years. The company has managed to grow earnings from $1.38/share in 2015 to $3.25/share in 2024. The company is expected to earn $3.63/share in 2025. The stock sells for 13.46 times forward earnings and a dividend yield of 2.13%. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) increased its quarterly dividend by 12% to $0.53/share. This will be the 15th consecutive increase in the annual dividend for this dividend achiever.

The company is expected to earn $6.80/share in 2025. The stock sells for 13.60 times forward earnings and a dividend yield of 2.03%. Bank OZK (OZK) increased its quarterly dividend to $0.44/share. While this is a 2.30% raise over the dividend paid in the previous quarterly, it is also a 10% increase over the dividend paid during the same time last year. Bank OZK tends to raise dividends every quarter. This dividend aristocrat has regularly increased dividends since 1997. It has managed to grow dividends at an annualized rate of 10.90% over the past five years. The company has managed to grow earnings from $2.10/share in 2015 to $6.16/share in 2024.

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Several of the large banking institutions in the US passed the Stress Tests imposed by the Federal Reserve. As a result, they announced their intentions to raise dividends and boost buyback allocations. I went through the list of increases from last week, and focused on the institutions that have a ten year track record of annual dividend increases: I also added ten year charts showcasing the trends in share price, quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends. In order to understand equity returns, you need to decompose them to their sources. Equity returns are a function of: 1. Dividend Yields 2. Earnings Per Share Growth 3. Change in valuation In the long-run, the first two items (dividends and earnings per share) are the so called fundamental sources of returns. They drive the total return over periods longer than say a decade. The changes of valuation matter the least in the very long-run. In the short-run however, for periods of five to ten years or less, valuation does matter a lot. This is why your returns would be much different if you bought a company at a starting yield of 4% versus a starting yield of 2%. That being said, rising earnings and dividends matter a lot too, because they provide the needed fuel behind great returns in the long-run. However, if you manage to acquire a good company at a discount, your potential returns will be higher. Visualizing the interplay between dividend yields, earnings per share growth and the changes in valuation showcases where returns have come from perfectly well. It also provides the perspective to determine where we are today, and also to potentially provide some markers as to where a potential future buy point could be set at. Bank of America (BAC) hiked its quarterly dividend by 8% to $0.28/share. This will be the 12th year of consecutive annual dividend increases for this dividend achiever.

All portfolio trades were executed with global reinsurance companies and top-tier Lloyd's of London syndicates, and were sourced through the top three global reinsurance brokers. MCM Fund I opens access to reinsurance income for a rapidly expanding capital base of new investors seeking diversified and uncorrelated investment alternatives with attractive yield and structured liquidity. The launch represents the growing importance of funds structuring their offerings to take advantage of the continuing convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Backed by Solana, Aptos, and Cardano and supported by institutions like Coinbase, Archax, Apex Group, and Envelop Risk, MembersCap has selected the Solana, Aptos, Cardano, and Base protocols to provide access to qualified investors wishing to invest using eligible cryptocurrencies. MembersCap has been selected as the first fund in the real-world assets category on the Archax platform, sitting alongside tokenized offerings from other institutions like BlackRock, State Street, and Aberdeen. The reinsurance opportunity Being fundamentally uncorrelated with the financial markets, reinsurance has consistently outperformed most traditional alternatives over the past two decades. Despite being highly yield-generative, the sector has historically been reserved for pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional giants. Increasingly, both crypto-native investors and smaller traditional allocators are seeking refuge from market volatility by accessing reinsurance as a stable, diversified income stream to support a balanced portfolio and enhance overall returns. "Every generation is presented with new technologies that unlock economic opportunity. To us, tokenisation and the blockchain represent access to better asset management for a different class of investor," said Lloyd Wahed, Co-Founder and CEO of MembersCap. "We're excited to be one of the first institutional funds to emerge from this space." "Our investors– digital asset institutions, family offices, HNWIs —want to meet their goals of resiliency and long-term sustainable growth through new and more efficient means. With this novel approach, we're seeing these investors view reinsurance as a core part of their portfolio for the first time," said Patrick Barrett, Co-Founder and COO at MembersCap. "This launch proves that tokenisation can bring new capital to help address the growing insurance protection gap by lowering barriers and providing access to the private reinsurance market," said Dr. Benjamin Fox, Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer at MembersCap. "Our tokenised model enables a new cohort of investors to participate pari passu alongside large institutions in an uncorrelated asset class with a track record of reliable, attractive returns." Positioned as an alternative to private equity, venture capital, and fixed income strategies, MCM Fund I provides qualified investors with regulated and collateralised access to reinsurance via direct exposure to natural catastrophe and cyber reinsurance contracts sourced through blue-chip global partners. For Web3 treasuries, foundations, and institutions, the Fund delivers high-yield opportunities and structured liquidity, derived from high-quality, real-world reinsurance returns, without exposure to DeFi volatility and over-concentration in altcoins. MembersCap was founded in 2024 and is backed by a strong coalition of both institutional and blockchain-native partners. This blend of traditional underwriting expertise and on-chain architecture ensures institutional-grade standards while embracing next-generation accessibility. About Members Capital ManagementFounded in 2024, Members Capital Management ("MembersCap") is a licensed investment manager regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, bridging institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Backed by leading blockchain protocols including Cardano, Aptos, and Solana, and supported by institutional infrastructure from Archax, Coinbase, Apex Group and Envelop Risk, MembersCap delivers a new institutional blueprint: tokenised participation to the global reinsurance market, an asset class traditionally closed to most investors.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily It is the latest decision in favor of the Sandro and Maje parent company. PARIS — SMCP will get its shares back. The Singapore High Court has ruled that Dynamic Treasure Group must return the 15.5 percent stake it holds to European TopSoho, the parent company of SMCP, which had been transferred illegally. The court ordered that Dynamic Treasure Group has one week to return the shares, or appeal the decision. In a statement, the company said it will “keep the market informed about the effective completion of the return of this stake.” Related Articles Celebrity News Princess Beatrice Brings Understated Flair in Striped Sandro Look to First Day of Wimbledon 2025 Financial SMCP Sales Gain 2.6% in Q1 Amid Strategic Shift Away From China This is the latest twist and turn in a case stemming from 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital of Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot parent company SMCP “disappeared” from France and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. You May Also Like This follows a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. It’s also the second ruling in the case within a month as it winds through courts and regulators in multiple jurisdictions. In June, French regulatory body Autorieté des Marchés Financiers fined the company and its shareholders for a series of irregularities. First, the regulatory body sanctioned former majority shareholder European TopSoho, director of European TopSoho Chenran Qiu and Dynamic Treasure Group, which received the shares, for disclosure violations and market manipulation. The shares were moved from Luxembourg to the British Virgin Islands without notifying the authorities. They effectively “went missing” until they reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by Qiu, weeks later. European TopSoho had sold them to DTG for a symbolic one-euro price. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu was involved in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. As a result, the AMF issued a series of fines. Qiu was sanctioned with 1 million euros, European TopSoho 400,000 euros, and Dynamic Treasure Group 300,000 for a total of 1.7 million euros. Separately, the AMF fined SMCP 20,000 euros for an unrelated leak of their financial information in 2021, when it accidentally published quarterly results on its website before market close. The London-based GLAS is the trustee for European TopSoho creditors including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan that united to save the group with the issuance of bonds, and effectively SMCP’s largest shareholder. They announced last year their intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares. That move could trigger a mandatory takeover action under French law if a single purchaser snaps them up. SMCP has been on the road to recovery as it seeks to replace the market share it lost in China by expanding into new regions in Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia and India. It recruited former Loewe executive Kleine Tan to take up the role of chief executive officer of SMCP Asia in April, tasked with implementing the company’s “strategic road map in the region, notably our network optimization in China,” she said in a statement shared first with WWD at the time.

Title: World of Warcraft: What’s Up With the Collector’s Bounty?
URL: https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-collectors-bounty-july-legacy-content-1851785640
Time Published: 2025-07-04T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As part of the run-up to patch 11.2, Blizzard is closing out Season 2 of World of Warcraft: The War Within with a couple of special events. One of them is a buff called Collector’s Bounty which is aimed at transmog collectors and mount farmers. Here’s what you might want to know before you jump in. There’s been some confusion about how Collector’s Bounty works. It was implemented on July 1 after the weekly reset, but took a couple of hours to kick in. Its effects were initially invisible. Now every character who logs into a modern TWW server will receive Collector’s Bounty on entry into the world. While this buff persists, bosses in every dungeon and raid instance in “legacy content” (any expansion before Dragonflight), drops double the normal loot. In dungeons, this typically means four to six items, while raid bosses can drop up to 12 depending on the raid’s difficulty setting. Anecdotally, it also seems as if dungeon monsters have a greater chance to drop green- and blue-quality items. This is a great opportunity to hunt down any transmogrification items you’ve been missing. (Personally, I use the AllTheThings add-on to track my collection, which is why my tooltips are slightly longer than usual). Further, several specific items, such as rare mounts and legendary weapons, have a +5 percent chance to drop during Collector’s Bounty. This is 10 times their usual drop rate, and some obsessed players have been trying to get them for actual calendar years. Maybe now’s their chance. Specific items affected by Collector’s Bounty include: Note: While not specifically affected by Collector’s Bounty, SoO has a few secret transmogrification items as boss drops, such as the Kor’kron Dark Shaman set and Mannoroth’s Tusks, that should be easier to farm now. In addition, keep an eye out for two high-demand cosmetic weapon drops from Antorus. Aggramar’s flaming sword Taeshalach has been a popular transmogrification option since Legion came out, and Argus has a low chance to drop his scythe. While anyone in Champion-track TWW gear or better should blast through most BfA content like it isn’t there, this is also where raid encounter design can get a bit tricky. For example, the Stormwall Blockade encounter in Dazar’lor has an instant kill built into it if you don’t interrupt Catastrophic Tides in time. (If you’re a warlock, make sure your felhunter is out.) The entrance to Ny’alotha can appear in either Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms depending on where the Black Empire is attacking in a given week. You can solo N’Zoth these days without the old BfA legendary cloak, but at current TWW gear levels, you cannot simply burst N’Zoth hard enough to ignore his central mechanics. You’ll need to enter his Mindgates and reclaim your Severed Consciousness or you’ll simply drop dead. While there are a couple of ways to reach various parts of the Shadowlands without having to go through its introductory sequence, you’ll typically end up out of phase with most of the features and characters. To get into places like the Maw or Zereth Mortis on a new character, you’ll need to start their introductory quests by talking to the Knights of Ebon Blade in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Like BfA, there are a few different bosses in Shadowlands with instant-kill gimmicks, particularly in mythic raids. While none of them have the firepower to really bother a level 80 character, given the stat inflation between this expansion and TWW, a few have abilities that can seriously ruin a solo raider’s day. Particular offenders here include the Jailer’s mind control, Soulrender Dormazain’s Warmonger Shackles, and Artificer Xy’mox’s Stasis Traps. Keep an eye on your dungeon journal. At time of writing, So’leah is also difficult to beat solo, as her dungeon gimmick gives her a massive damage reduction bonus that you can’t dispel without a team. You can either autoattack her for 10 minutes, bring friends, or use a level 80 monk’s Touch of Death to bypass her shields and drop her in one hit. Collector’s Bounty in World of Warcraft is currently planned to last until July 28. .

Friday, July 4th, 2025 Trading activity was thin towards the end of this week as the United States celebrates Independence Day – with a record-breaking 72 million people traveling – but both ICE Brent and WTI edged slightly lower on expectations of OPEC+ hiking production targets again in August. Whilst OPEC+’s Saturday meeting seems to be a rather predictable affair, next week’s big price moves will be dictated by the July 9 tariff deadline as Asian countries try their luck with last-minute negotiations with President Trump. OPEC+ Moves Its July Meeting a Day Ahead. Sticking to its policy of trying to surprise market watchers, the group of eight OPEC+ producers unwinding production cuts decided to move their meeting initially planned for July 6 to Saturday, in anticipation of yet another 411,000 b/d monthly output hike. Trading Giant Tries Its Luck with Last-Minute Bid. A consortium led by privately-held trading giant Vitol submitted an eleventh-hour bid for Venezuela-owned US refiner Citgo Petroleum, offering more than 10 billion for Citgo’s 807,000 b/d capacity for three refineries, the highest known offer in the ongoing auction. India Wants to Expand Strategic Reserves. The government of India has started feasibility studies on the construction of three new strategic petroleum storage sites, more than doubling the current 40-million-barrel SPR stock, placing a special emphasis on salt caverns in the northern state of Rajasthan. Exxon Returns Unused Guyana Acreage to State. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has returned 2,534 km2 (equivalent to 978 sq miles) of the Stabroek block offshore Guyana to the South American country’s government, relinquishing it after it didn’t manage to explore or develop those territories. BlackRock Comes to the Rescue. With Saudi Arabia expected to take on more debt this year after a $15.6 billion deficit in Q1, US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reportedly expressed interest in selling its stake in Saudi Aramco’s (TADAWUL:2222) natural gas pipeline network back to the NOC. China Eases Taxation on Embattled Teapots. The regional government of Shandong hiked fuel oil import tax rebates for independent refiners in the region, returning between 75% and 95% of payable consumption tax for gasoline and diesel as most ‘teapots’ barely survive at 50-55% utilization rates. Brazil Eyes More Exploration Money. Following a bumper revenue stream of 180 million from Brazil’s 5th Concession Offer bidding last month, the Latin American country now wants to hold an additional E&P auction to be organized in 2025 still for uncontracted pre-salt areas, eyeing higher budget revenue. Glencore Mulls Its Options with UK Refinery. Swiss-based global trading house Glencore (LON:GLEN) has been in talks with the UK government over the fate of the 113,000 b/d Lindsey refinery, caught in great turmoil after the insolvency of its operator Prax, as Glencore has been its exclusive crude supplier. Sanctions-Hit Venezuela Revisits China Dependence. Despite the Trump administration’s sanctions snapback on Venezuela, PDVSA’s exports of oil and refined products edged slightly higher in June to 844,000 b/d, however almost 90% of all flows are now moving towards China, a longtime ally. US Oil Drilling Wanes on Uncertain Outlook. According to the latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, oil and gas business activity in the US turned negative in Q2 2025 as the uncertainty index soared to 47.1, with almost half of companies expecting to drill fewer wells this year than initially expected. Japan Wants Fully-Fledged Carbon Trading by 2027. Japan launched discussions with domestic industry participants to kick-start its full-scale emissions trading system by 2027, mandating that all companies emitting more than 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 participate in ETS trading, a step up from the current voluntary market. Ecuador Declares Force Majeure on Oil Production. Ecuador’s state oil company Petroecuador declared force majeure on all its operations after the 360,000 b/d SOTE and 450,000 b/d OCP pipelines carrying crude from the country’s inner regions to the coast were damaged by landslides and erosion. Trump Admin Lifts Restrictions on China-Bound Ethane. The US Commerce Department rescinded its mandate for US ethane exporters to seek export licenses for deliveries to China, with both Enterprise and Energy Transfer confirming flows from the Morgan’s Point and Nederland terminals have fully resumed.

Title: Is Elon Musk Really Behind the Bitcoin Buzz This Time?

Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:56:08Z

The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility induced by Elon Musk. His tweets have historically caused major price swings. But as BTC flirts with fresh highs, the current rally is more data-driven—and the Tesla CEO’s role remains unconfirmed. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has achieved a historic milestone by closing the second quarter at its highest level ever, reaching $107,149 on the Bitstamp exchange. This performance follows an 11.6% decline in the first quarter, but Bitcoin rebounded with a 30% gain in the second quarter. Social metrics from LunarCrush and Santiment show a spike in Bitcoin-related engagement following a cryptic tweet from Musk on June 29. The post included a rocket emoji and a dollar symbol—enough to prompt a flurry of interpretations from the crypto community. However, no direct reference to Bitcoin was made. Analysts at CryptoQuant and Kaiko note that while social sentiment surged after the tweet, no significant wallet activity linked to Musk or Tesla has been reported. Bloomberg estimates that BlackRock IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI remains under 60, suggesting there’s room for more momentum. Price is holding above its 50-day ($105,970) and 200-day ($87,717) moving averages. Meanwhile, whale activity appears mixed. IntoTheBlock data shows a 45% drop in large BTC transactions over the past month, suggesting some cooling among high-net-worth traders. Still, BTC’s technical posture remains bullish. The network’s health and rising ETF demand suggest fundamental strength rather than hype-driven movement. While Elon Musk’s influence on the market remains a wildcard, current data suggests that his actions do not primarily drive Bitcoin’s momentum.

Title: Nvidia Briefly on Track to Become World's Most Valuable Company Ever

Photo Credit: Reuters Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4 percent to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalization than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5 percent at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7 percent to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8 percent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 percent from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalization underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7 percent of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28 percent of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

DeFi Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “DeFi Technologies”) (Nasdaq: DEFT) (CBOE CA: DEFI) (GR: R9B), a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (“DeFi”), has announced its expansion in the GCC and MENA region with the registration of DEFI DMCC (certification no DMCC199558) with offices in Jumeirah Lake Towers Dubai UAE. 0 04 July 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour, and Valour Digital Securities Limited (and, together with Valour Inc., “Valour”) a leading issuer of exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) has also opened a trading desk at DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Center) in UAE. The DeFi Technologies team and its subsidiary Valour, aim to support the increased institutional interest in digital assets in the GCC region and specifically in the UAE. This expansion into the Middle East is a key element of the strategy to increase product offerings and global footprint. As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy through its integrated and scalable business model. This includes Valour, which offers access to more than 65 of the world’s most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs with plans to offer 100 by the end of 2025. With regulatory momentum, product velocity, and institutional credibility converging, DEFT is positioning itself as the BlackRock of Web3. Globally, institutional capital is pouring into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and in the Middle East and in the UAE in specific this is also becoming a trend. Recently, UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announced it expanded its position in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF showcasing the latest example of institutions increasingly turning to non-traditional exposures wrapped in an ETF. Bitcoin ETPs are facilitating greater exposure for investors who had been interested in crypto but want a familiar and efficient wrapper. Currently, total assets under management (“AUM”) in crypto ETPs have reached $176.3 billion. Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour, stated, “ We believe the demand for digital asset ETPs will increase not only globally but in the GCC and Middle East. Investors whether sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, family offices and even retail investors are interested in crypto but require familiar and efficient vehicles to get exposure.” He adds, “Wrapping digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated financial instruments such as ETPs will increase the number of crypto investors and offer countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia access to international foreign investment. Local and international get exposure to these assets through trusted providers like the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, Dubai Financial Markets, and others.” Already DeFi Technologies has expanded into Turkey through a collaboration with Misyon Bank, and Misyon Kripto to work to introduce ETPs. In Turkey currently over 50% of investor population are holding digital assets. In 2024, DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour partnered with GulfCap Investment Bank (“GCIB”), a licensed investment bank as its key Transaction Advisor for the proposed cross-listing of Valour’s ETPs on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) in Kenya. The proposed cross-listing will allow Valour’s ETPs to be traded in Kenyan Shillings on the NSE and provide investors in East Africa with exposure to leading digital assets through regulated investment vehicles. In Europe DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour currently offers 65+ fully hedged digital asset ETPs on leading European exchanges including Xetra, Spotlight, and Euronext.

Title: One of America's most important companies slashes 20,000 jobs and offers huge buyouts

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 5:44:20 AM PDT by DFG UPS is offering voluntary buyouts to its full-time US drivers following its decision to slash 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities. The Atlanta-based company will be providing its laid off employees with various benefits, including pensions and healthcare. The layoffs are part of UPS's network configuration plan, which also confirms the upcoming closures of over 90 more facilities in the future. The changes are part of the company's $3.5 billion cost reduction target for 2025, aiming to reach a 12 percent US operational margin by next year. UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

For one thing they have a lot of competition, so they are by no means a bell weather. Many, many years ago, like almost 60 years, I worked at a place that got deliveries and shipped stuff as well. Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then. Well, a few years later, he was out of a job, and the company he worked for was out of business. That company was known as REA… Railroad Express Agency. I think there is a lesson there. 20 posted on 07/04/2025 7:59:33 AM PDT by Ditto [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

For one thing they have a lot of competition, so they are by no means a bell weather. Many, many years ago, like almost 60 years, I worked at a place that got deliveries and shipped stuff as well. Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then. Well, a few years later, he was out of a job, and the company he worked for was out of business. That company was known as REA… Railroad Express Agency.

The changes are part of the company's $3.5 billion cost reduction target for 2025, aiming to reach a 12 percent US operational margin by next year. UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

For one thing they have a lot of competition, so they are by no means a bell weather. Many, many years ago, like almost 60 years, I worked at a place that got deliveries and shipped stuff as well. Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then. Well, a few years later, he was out of a job, and the company he worked for was out of business. That company was known as REA… Railroad Express Agency. I think there is a lesson there. 20 posted on 07/04/2025 7:59:33 AM PDT by Ditto [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then.

July 04, 2025 08:08 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged toward its all-time high in recent weeks, adding around 50% since dropping to its April lows as crypto changes the game for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, which is braced for a “big” month ahead after the White House crypto czar teased a major update, has climbed to give bitcoin a total market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, with bullish traders predicting a looming bitcoin price boom. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that remain on the sidelines, bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to Congress she described as “groundbreaking.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has declared himself the first "crypto president," helping the bitcoin ... More price soar. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world,” Lummis said in a statement. The bill would see small crypto transactions of less than $300 exempt from taxes, as well as crypto lending, and defer taxes on income generated from crypto mining and staking until the coins are sold. It would also apply a typical 30-day wash rule to crypto, removing a loophole that has allowed crypto investors to sell at a loss only to buy back in again while still claiming a tax deduction. Lummis highlighted estimates from the congressional joint committee on taxation that estimated the bill would generate about $600 million through 2034. “We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” Lummis said. Lummis had tried to squeeze the crypto tax reforms into U.S. president Donald Trump’s so-called "one, big, beautiful" bill but ran out of time before the Senate sent it to the House. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, propelled by U.S. president Donald Trump's ... More return to the White House. Trump’s "one, big, beautiful bill," designed to overhaul the U.S. tax-and-spend landscape and power the country’s next phase of growth while adding an expected $3 trillion of debt and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, has been passed by the House of Representatives. House Republicans have meanwhile declared the week beginning July 14 "crypto week," in which policymakers will focus on three major crypto bills—the stablecoin Genius Act, the market structure Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC [central bank digital currency] Surveillance State Act. The Trump administration’s pro-bitcoin and crypto agenda has been named as a catalyst for a bitcoin price break out in coming months. “We expect bitcoin to print new all-time highs in the second half of the year, buoyed by growing ETF [exchange-traded fund] and corporate treasury flows, as well as U.S. policy and regulatory developments,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. Spot bitcoin ETFs, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, as well as so-called bitcoin treasury companies that have sprung up in the wake of Michael Saylor’s bitcoin-buying giant Strategy, have hoovered up more than $100 billion worth of bitcoin between them in the last few years.

The holiday season is make-or-break for many retailers, with Christmas marketing turning up the heat on sales and customer engagement. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported U.S. holiday (November-December) retail sales reached a record $994.1 billion in 2024, up 4% from 2023. That’s nearly $1 trillion of buying power in just two months. And about 55% of e‑commerce Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) is generated in the last two quarters of the year. With consumers ready to spend, it’s essential to have a solid plan in place. Here are 22 proven Christmas marketing ideas, complete with real examples and practical tips to help inspire impactful festive campaigns. Holiday shoppers behave differently from other times of year. Many start early: roughly 28% of consumers begin holiday shopping before Labor Day, and nearly 73% aim to have most gifts purchased by December. In other words, planning for Christmas Marketing should begin well in advance (late summer or early fall) to catch early-bird buyers. Mobile and social channels dominate this season: mobile devices generate 71% of digital traffic and 56% of orders during the holidays, while 89% of consumers say social media influences their holiday shopping. Moreover, festive campaigns also play by different rules than everyday promotions. Shoppers expect holiday-themed storytelling, festive visuals, and limited-time urgency. Campaigns that feel warm, joyful, and generous can cut through the clutter. As Subharun Mukherjee, Head of Marketing at CleverTap, notes in the Guide to Optimizing Massive Online Sales (OMOS) Events e-book: “Global online events are revolutionizing the e‑commerce landscape, with companies reporting their highest sales during the holiday season. During online sales events, customers are inundated with deals, discounts, and exclusive offers, making it even harder for businesses to differentiate themselves from the competition.” Merchants must align their Christmas marketing ideas with today’s realities: digital-first, mobile-optimized, and emotionally resonant campaigns that stand out in a crowded and competitive environment. Christmas marketing requires early, creative planning and strategies tuned to seasonal mindsets. With that in mind, here are 22 top Christmas marketing ideas to boost sales this holiday season: Run a “25 Days of Christmas” sale or advent-style countdown on your site. Feature a different deal or product each day and promote it via email marketing, SMS, and push notification. Daily surprises (e.g., flash discounts or bonus gifts) build excitement and urgency as Christmas approaches. You can use CleverTap for Christmas marketing to schedule automated push or in-app messages for each day’s offer, keeping users engaged with timed alerts. This approach gamifies shopping and drives repeat visits to see what’s next. Create themed gift bundles (e.g., “Holiday Wellness Kit” or “Winter Warmth Bundle”) that group complementary products with a special price. Bundles encourage customers to buy more in one order. Product bundles drive up the average order value (AOV) by encouraging customers to purchase more items in one go. For example, Apple’s holiday strategy includes exclusive bundles with premium services, targeting loyal users with limited-time offers, proving that even simple bundles can feel high-end with the right positioning. Source: KennyLee Creative Make the bundles feel exclusive (limited supply or exclusive items) and wrapped in festive packaging or imagery. For example, group best-selling items together or curate gifts around a theme like “Gifts for Her” or “Gourmet Food Basket.” CleverTap can help here by recommending bundles to customers based on their past purchases or browsing behavior, or by sending targeted emails promoting bundles to those who have shown interest in similar products. Occasionally run surprise flash sales or “lightning deals” on key days during Christmas marketing campaigns. Because these are on a very short deadline (hours or a day), they tap into shoppers’ fear of missing out (FOMO). Limited-time offers with a ticking clock get people to act fast. Promote flash sales aggressively: use site banners, social media posts, and especially SMS or push alerts to ensure customers see the deal immediately. CleverTap can orchestrate these multi-channel blasts, allowing you to reach email, push, and social channels simultaneously and follow up with reminders. Because timing is key, set up countdown timers on pages and send alerts at the sale’s midpoint and final hour. Offer free shipping on holiday orders (possibly with a minimum threshold) and emphasize hassle-free returns. Free shipping is one of the most powerful incentives: around 60% of shoppers will add extra items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping. Prominently advertise “Free Shipping” on banner ads, email subject lines, and product pages. Extend your return window as well, reassuring customers that any gifts that don’t fit can be returned in January at no additional cost. From an operational view, free returns are also important: 45% of consumers rank free return shipping as most important to them. Give your online store a seasonal look. Update homepage banners, product images, and CTAs with a holiday theme (think snowflakes, twinkling lights, or red-and-green color schemes). Change button text to holiday calls-to-action (“Shop Holiday Gifts” instead of “Shop Now”). These visual cues signal to visitors that they’re in a festive shopping environment. A themed site also feels fresh and can boost engagement. (Don’t forget holiday-specific SEO – e.g., update meta titles/descriptions to include keywords like “Christmas sale,” “holiday gifts,” etc.) Give your logo, product images, or packaging a limited-edition holiday twist. Even a slight seasonal makeover can make your brand more shareable on social. Iconic examples prove the power of this: Starbucks’ annual red holiday cup (introduced in 1997) became a cultural touchpoint signaling the start of the holiday season. Source: Forbes Similarly, Hershey’s Kisses added red-and-green foil wrappers and holiday ads, cementing their image as a holiday staple. Source: Herseyland You can do the same at your scale. Add Santa hats to your logo, wrap products in festive-themed boxes, or create holiday gift tags. When packaging looks gift-ready, customers are more likely to share photos on social media, amplifying your reach. Pick an overarching theme or narrative for your Christmas marketing. For example, run a “12 Days of Gifting” campaign, a Santa’s workshop theme, or a winter wonderland story. This theme should tie together your emails, social posts, ads, and on-site banners. For example, WestJet Airlines created a heartwarming “Christmas Miracle” narrative. They set up a video Santa to ask passengers what they wanted, then secretly bought everyone’s wishes and delivered the gifts on the baggage carousel. The whole event was filmed as a story and went massively viral (27+ million YouTube views in one week). Source: WestJet Christmas Miracle: Real-time Giving Story-driven campaigns make messaging cohesive and memorable. Each email or social post can continue the story (Day 1: “Santa’s stocking stuffers – 20% off!”; Day 2: “Elves’ favorite toys – buy one, get one”). A consistent theme reinforces your brand’s holiday voice. Craft a special holiday email series tailored to customer segments. Send promotional emails based on behavior: for instance, if a customer looked at winter coats, email them a curated gift guide of related items. If another customer was a frequent buyer last holiday, give them a VIP early access deal. Personalize subject lines (“[Name], unwrap your 20% off gift inside!”) and content by recipient. Segment your lists (e.g., “Frequent buyers”, “Browsers of category X”) and send each a custom holiday message. For example, you could send “Gifts for Tech Lovers” to gadget-seekers and “Gifts Under $50” to budget shoppers. For example, Travelodge’s festive email invited users to “Make a Wish This Christmas” for a chance to win a 2025 trip, combining seasonal visuals, interactive elements, and segmented travel suggestions by season. A smart blend of personalization and engagement to drive early bookings. Source: ReallyGoodEmails CleverTap’s email automation and segmentation make this easy: it can pull user attributes like past purchases or interest tags to populate email content and ensure each shopper sees relevant product suggestions. Leverage user-generated content with holiday-themed social media contests. For instance, challenge followers to share a photo of themselves with your product in a festive setting, using a branded holiday hashtag (e.g., #MyBrandGift). Or run a “12 Days of Christmas Wish List” challenge: each day, invite customers to comment with their holiday wishlist item from your store for a chance to win it. These interactive posts boost engagement and spread brand visibility. Encourage participants by offering small prizes (like a coupon code or free gift) for the best or most creative entry. Remember to repost the best entries on your own channels; it increases reach and adds authenticity. For example, Starbucks launched a #RedCupContest on Instagram where customers were invited to post creative photos of the seasonal red cup. One year, Starbucks received over 24,000 entries in just 5 days during the contest. Source: People Magazine Build fun, interactive web pages or microsites to engage visitors. Ideas include a “spin-the-wheel” discount game, a festive quiz (“Which Holiday Gift Suits You?”), or a digital advent calendar that reveals a coupon or product each day. Gamification can significantly boost engagement and conversions. In fact, research has found that 60% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a brand that includes a gamified experience, and conversion rates can jump up to 7X higher with game-like widgets. For example, a spin-to-win pop-up (“Spin Santa’s Wheel for Your Discount!”) rewards users with a random discount or freebie in exchange for an email signup. These interactive elements make shopping fun and encourage visitors to stay on your site longer. Sephora introduced a holiday “Gift Finder” quiz on its site. Visitors answer questions about the gift recipient and budget, and the quiz suggests products. They promoted the feature via Instagram and saw huge success. Source: Sephora Indonesia Capitalize on the popularity of short-form video. Create holiday-themed video content for ads and social reels (Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts). This could be a heartwarming story featuring your product as a gift, a quick demo of a holiday deal, or even a lighthearted Christmas jingle. Vertical videos with cheerful holiday music get high engagement on social feeds. For example, a restaurant might film quick clips of festive table settings and specials, or a clothing brand could showcase “Outfit ideas for Christmas parties” in a fast montage. Keep videos short (15–30 seconds) with a clear call to action (e.g., “Shop Now” or “Learn More”). Pair them with holiday hashtags and target them carefully using demographics/interests. Coca-Cola is a great example. Their 2024 “Share the Magic” holiday campaign had TikTok and Instagram influencers sharing personal holiday moments featuring Coca-Cola. They incorporated Coca-Cola’s iconic holiday assets (the vintage Santa, the red trucks) in these bite-sized videos to tap into nostalgia while reaching younger viewers on Reels. Source: Social Storis Publish curated gift guides targeted by shopper persona or recipient. For example: “Gifts for Him,” “Gifts for Kids,” “Gifts Under $25,” “Tech Lover’s Holiday Picks,” etc. Place these guides on your site or as separate landing pages, and link to them in your ads and emails. CleverTap can help personalize this even further. For instance, when a user in-app or on-site browses a category (say, beauty products), you could dynamically show the “Gifts for Her” guide as a suggested page. Gift guides not only simplify shopping, but they also give more exposure to your products. Send customers to the appropriate guide via segmented emails: e.g., email your fashion-loyal customers with “Holiday Style Gift Guide” and your gadget fans with “Best Tech Gifts.” This targeted approach can significantly increase conversions, since shoppers find gifts relevant to their needs. Wishlists make holiday shopping fun and viral: customers can build a list of items they want and easily send it to family and friends. Ensure your site or app supports sharing (via email, social media, or direct link) and display a “Most Wished For” carousel on your homepage. When someone shares a wishlist, you gain new potential customers (friends/family). Wishlists also give you valuable data about what people want. If a user adds an item to a wishlist, you could later send a reminder (“Hey, [Name], items on your wishlist are going fast – get 10% off them today!”). Following up with customers about items on their wishlist – especially if stock is low or a sale is ending – significantly boosts conversions. Amazon popularized this with its shareable Wish Lists. For the holidays, they even introduced a dedicated “Holiday Gift List” feature so families can aggregate gift ideas in one place and share the link around. Source: Amazon Reward and motivate customers who shop early. Offer an “early bird” discount or bonus gift for purchases made in October or early November. For example, a “Halloween to Black Friday” sale pass, or a limited-time code “EARLYXMAS” for 15% off purchases made by November 15. This not only drives early sales (helping you plan inventory and revenue) but also prevents waiting shoppers from drifting to competitors later. For Christmas marketing, CleverTap can identify customers who have previously purchased and automatically target them with these exclusive pre-holiday deals via push or email. Remind all subscribers with email campaigns highlighting inventory or shipping deadlines. Send customers a heartfelt holiday greeting (digital or even printed mailer) with a personalized touch and a coupon. A simple “Happy Holidays, and thank you for shopping with us” message can go a long way. Beyond just text, consider adding a small gift, such as a unique promo code or coupon, inside the card. This makes customers feel valued as individuals, not just revenue sources. With CleverTap’s Promos, you an make this happen easily. Handwritten notes or limited-edition printed postcards (sent to top customers) can also create a memorable “wow” moment during Christmas marketing campaigns. Either way, the aim is to strengthen loyalty by making customers feel appreciated during the season. Chewy, the pet supplies retailer, is renowned for sending actual handwritten holiday cards to its customers. They employ a whole team of card-writers to pen personal notes thanking customers (often including something personal like the pet’s name). Source: X.com Use CleverTap’s automation to trigger thank-you notes at scale: for instance, after a November purchase, you could send a “Thank You for Your Support – Enjoy 10% Off Next Order!” holiday email. Another Christmas marketing idea is to leverage the holiday goodwill by launching a seasonal referral bonus. Reward customers who refer friends and family with holiday-themed incentives. For example, “Give $10, Get $10” gift cards or double reward points if a new customer buys a gift. Make it a win-win: the referrer gets a reward, and the friend also enjoys a welcome discount. Promote the referral offer in your emails, app, and on receipts (“Refer a friend this holiday and you’ll both get $10 off!”). During Christmas, people love recommending gifts. You’re just amplifying word-of-mouth in a measurable way. Run a Christmas-themed giveaway to boost engagement and follower counts. For example, host a social media contest: “Win a $100 Gift Box from us” by liking, sharing, or tagging friends. Alternatively, a photo contest like “Most Festive Decorated Tree” or “Coziest Winter Workspace” featuring your products. Contests create buzz, user-generated content, and excitement around your brand. Make sure the prize is something attractive (perhaps one of your bundles or gift cards). Collect entries and emails (with permission) so you can notify winners. Featuring user photos as part of the contest also builds social proof. Team up with influencers or bloggers for holiday gift roundups. Identify micro-influencers in your niche (e.g., parenting, tech, beauty) and send them a curated holiday gift set. Have them unbox or review the products on social media or YouTube, ideally in a Christmas-themed video (e.g., “Top 5 Holiday Gifts I’m Giving” featuring your products). Alo Yoga did a special holiday collaboration: they released a limited Advent Calendar box of goodies and sent it to wellness influencers, who then unboxed one item each day on TikTok and Instagram. Those influencer videos not only reviewed the products but also built excitement day by day. Source: Alo Yoga Influencers’ authentic recommendations can reach highly targeted audiences. Provide them with a unique discount code to share, creating urgency for their followers. Partner with another brand or artist for a co-branded holiday product or bundle. For example, a fashion retailer might team up with a local accessory designer to create a limited-edition holiday ornament or scarf. Such collaborations generate press and social media interest. Promote the special product jointly in both partners’ marketing channels and offer it as a gift idea. Even a small co-branding (e.g., a custom gift card design with a local artist) can add novelty. CleverTap can assist by creating segments of customers who like either brand and sending them announcements about the new launch, maximizing reach across both customer bases. “Give back” campaigns resonate deeply at Christmas. For instance, run a “buy one, donate one” promotion (e.g., for every product sold, you donate the same item to charity) or pledge a percentage of holiday revenue to a cause. Customers feel good about purchasing when they know it helps someone else. Promote this heavily: add a banner like “This Holiday, Every Purchase Helps [Cause]” on your site. A great campaign idea is to let customers choose between several charities at checkout and match their choice. Not only does this increase goodwill, but it also encourages buyers who prioritize ethical brands. The more visible the campaign (social posts, emails, site banners), the more it amplifies both the impact and your brand’s feel-good story. For example, Lego’s annual #BuildToGive campaign asks fans to build a Lego ornament and share it; for each one posted, Lego donates a set to a child in need. Source: Lego Incorporate local or community elements into your holiday marketing. For example, you could highlight artwork from local artists on your holiday cards or use photos of your local team prepping for Christmas (if appropriate). Feature stories about how your business is celebrating with the community. By foregrounding a local angle (e.g., “Made in [Your City] with love” or “Local artisans in our holiday market”), you tap into that trend. Host a local pop-up event or collaborate with a neighborhood charity, and share it on social. These efforts humanize your brand and can foster loyalty from customers who value community impact. Use clever follow-ups to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers. For everyone who purchased during the Christmas season, send a thank-you email or in-app note in early January. Include a New Year coupon or free shipping code to entice another purchase. Showing appreciation after the fact builds loyalty. A simple “Thank you for your support – enjoy 15% off your next order” goes a long way. Schedule these as automated flows in CleverTap so that every holiday buyer enters a post-purchase sequence. You can also use behavioral triggers, such as offering early access to your January sales to customers who have made multiple holiday purchases. This recency-based outreach keeps your brand top-of-mind and can turn satisfied holiday shoppers into regulars. CleverTap provides the personalization and automation backbone to scale these ideas. Its platform unifies customer data and engagement across push, in-app, email, SMS, and more. For example, CleverTap can create user segments (by location, purchase history, or holiday affinity) and automate tailored campaigns: sending a “12 Days of Deals” push series to one group, while emailing “Gifts for Her” guides to another. Features like behavioral triggers and real-time analytics enable you to instantly remarket to a wishlist user, trigger a cart abandonment email, or send a holiday thank-you flow with minimal manual effort. Many brands use CleverTap to send millions of holiday notifications at peak times, ensuring personalized offers reach the right customers. CleverTap helps you plan, personalize, and perfect your Christmas campaigns. It handles large holiday traffic with built-in scalability, and its reporting lets you see which strategies are driving sales and where to tweak.

Title: Fears of an AI workforce takeover may be overblown — but it's still scrambling firms' hiring plans
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/is-ai-taking-jobs-which-industries-at-risk-what-to-know-rcna215579

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing chorus of executives has put white collar workforces on notice: Their jobs are at risk of being wiped out by artificial intelligence. Yet above that din is a more complicated picture of how AI is currently affecting hiring. Direct evidence of an acceleration in human obsolescence remains scant so far. In a report this week, the job and hiring consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said cuts spurred by President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency remained the leading cause of job losses — especially for government, nonprofit and other sectors supported by federal funds — followed by general economic and market conditions. Out of 286,679 planned layoffs so far this year, only 20,000 were linked to automation, the firm said — with just 75 explicitly tied to AI implementation. “Far less is happening than people imagine,” said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the consultancy, referring to the impact of AI on the broader workforce in the U.S. “There are roles that can be significantly changed by AI right now, but I’m not talking to too many HR leaders who say AI is replacing jobs.” That belies recent comments made by some of America’s most prominent executives about the impact that artificial intelligence is expected to have. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned that AI would “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. However, he did not lay out what that time frame might look like. He also said more people would likely be needed to do “other types of jobs,” ones that AI may help generate. And while The Wall Street Journal reported comments from Ford CEO Jim Farley this week that AI would replace “literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.,” a clip of Farley’s presentation offered more context. The automotive executive was speaking about beefing up America’s blue-collar workforce, and appeared to be repeating the warning about a white-collar wipeout issued by the CEO of the AI company Anthropic — a contention that is still being debated. (A representative for Ford did not respond to a request for comment.) Experts say the current era of AI is affecting the job market in more roundabout ways. Many firms are currently under tremendous pressure to cut costs given the generally uncertain economic environment spurred by the heavy cost of Trump’s tariff policy and worries about rising inflation. As a result, some companies are diverting spending that would otherwise be going to hiring more employees and shifting it toward AI software. “There’s basically a blank check to go out and buy these AI tools,” said Josh Bersin, CEO of The Josh Bersin Company workforce consultancy. “Then they go out and say, as far as head count: No more hiring. Just, ‘stop.’ So that immediately freezes the job market.” Among the most high-profile examples is Shopify, whose CEO told employees they must now prove why they “cannot get what they want done using AI” before asking for more employees and resources. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote in a memo sent to employees in March. “This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” The chief executive of language learning app Duolingo, Luis von Ahn, issued a similar edict in May, writing that the firm would gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle and that a budget for new employees would only be given “if a team cannot automate more of their work.” Enough firms hedging in this way, alongside a wider economic slowdown, may indeed be suppressing overall hiring, especially in business and professional services. But those trends do not amount to large-scale replacement of existing workers by AI agents. Then there are the firms creating the AI tools themselves — the ones other businesses are ostensibly looking to purchase and deploy to automate their workforces. These AI developers, including Dell, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce, have been shedding workers not tied to AI product development and shifting resources toward those who are. If AI is causing job losses, it’s not because it’s doing someone else’s job. It’s because budgets — and demands on the bottom line — are changing. The state of hiring at Microsoft is illustrative. Over the past several weeks, the tech giant — whose stock has surged 17% year to date thanks in part to the popularity of its Copilot AI tool — has announced job cuts affecting some 15,000 roles, or about 7% of its workforce. In this case, some human replacement does appear to be occurring: CEO Satya Nadella said recently that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI — something Bloomberg News confirmed in a report showing software engineering roles made up more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut in one of the recent layoff rounds. Yet other analysts indicated the cuts were also likely designed to offset the costs associated with Microsoft’s massive buildout of data centers designed to handle AI computer processing. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000” in order to make up for its increased capital expenditures, said Gil Luria, a tech research analyst at D.A. Davidson financial group, in an interview with Reuters. In a note to clients, analysts with the consultancy Capital Economics said not all mentions of AI by businesses discussing their financial picture should be taken at face value. “For some firms, AI is a way to spin job losses driven by poor financial performance in a more positive light,” they wrote. AI is also affecting the hiring and recruiting process itself. A galaxy of startups now offers tools that can perform the job of entire HR departments, from scanning resumes to interviewing candidates. At IBM, “a couple hundred” HR workers have been recently replaced by AI agents, CEO Arvind Krishna told The Wall Street Journal in May. Yet with those efficiencies, the company was able to hire more programmers and salespeople, he said. “While we have done a huge amount of work inside IBM on leveraging AI and automation on certain enterprise workflows, our total employment has actually gone up, because what it does is it gives you more investment to put into other areas,” Krishna said. For anyone struggling to find new work, AI is not without blame. But experts say economic factors continue to vastly outweigh the threat from automation. “Our research has shown that AI will fundamentally change a whole lot of jobs, some by a lot,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. In the case of software developers especially, she said, roles are being completely transformed. “But does it still mean AI took that job? I don’t think so,” she said. “There’s not evidence that it’s fully replacing whole workers, or that the current slowdown can be attributed to it.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nvidia on track to become world's most valuable company

Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion yesterday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4% to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5% at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7% to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centres and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the UK. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7% of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28% of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Title: Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia lead Wall Street’s AI revolution

Nvidia touched a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly overtaking Apple's record valuation. Its stock climbed as high as $160.98 in early trade before settling at $159.60, placing its valuation at $3.89 trillion—just short of Apple’s all-time high of $3.915 trillion from December 2024.(Source: Reuters) Investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence continues to surge, with Nvidia at the center of this wave. Its high-end chips are now essential for training advanced AI models, making the company a prime beneficiary of the current AI investment cycle. Tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla are racing to build out AI data centers. This has created unprecedented demand for Nvidia’s processors. Microsoft’s market cap stands at $3.7 trillion, while Apple, now in third place, is valued at $3.19 trillion. Nvidia’s transformation has been dramatic. From a valuation of $500 billion in 2021, the company’s worth has soared nearly eight-fold, nearing the $4 trillion mark. It’s now more valuable than the entire Canadian and Mexican stock markets combined and surpasses the market cap of all UK-listed companies. Despite the explosive stock gains, Nvidia trades at about 32 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. That’s actually below its five-year average of 41, signaling that earnings estimates are rising even faster than its share price. Nvidia’s shares have rebounded over 68% since their April low, which followed market fears around President Trump’s global tariff plans. Optimism around potential trade deals has helped ease concerns, reigniting investor confidence. As Nvidia becomes increasingly dominant, its influence is spreading across the broader market. The company now makes up 7% of the S&P 500. Together with Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, these tech giants comprise 28% of the entire index, impacting millions of retirement portfolios. Despite the enthusiasm, some experts urge caution. Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners warns that while AI is a powerful productivity tool, the current models—especially large language and reasoning models—may fall short of expectations. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Nvidia started as a niche GPU company for video games. Today, it has become Wall Street’s go-to indicator for the AI sector, even replacing Intel in the Dow Jones index in a landmark shift for the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia’s future looks bright, challenges remain. In January, a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, shook markets with a cheaper model that outperformed Western rivals. If such trends continue, spending on high-end processors could come under pressure. However, Nvidia’s momentum and strategic positioning still keep it ahead of the curve.

Photo: Adrian Murrell/Getty Images Limerick rugby has always been different. For generations rugby was a middle-class, if not upper-class, pursuit, in Ireland. The vast majority of the rugby playing population began their careers in the most prestigious fee-paying schools in Ireland, like Clongowes and Blackrock College. This point was reflected in Brendan Behan’s observation: “I never heard rugby was a proper game for anyone except bank clerks. It was a game for the Protestant and the shop-keeping Catholic and I never thought it had anything to do with me.”

Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2 per cent at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fuelling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $498.5. Apple rose 0.8 per cent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place.

Title: Cloudflare’s AI game-changer, Intel’s challenges and the Trump-Musk catfight

UPDATED 23:06 EDT / JULY 03 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Artificial intelligence model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic that have had a mostly free ride on scraping the entire internet to train their models may be facing a serious roadblock now. Internet infrastructure services firm Cloudflare this week enabled website operators to charge AI developers for access to their material. It’s a bit of a closing-the-barn-door-after-the-horses-fled situation — not Cloudflare’s fault — but since AI models need constant training and retraining, maybe this will change the balance of power. Meanwhile, competition is intensifying in AI — isn’t it always? Apple, for one, is playing off Anthropic against OpenAI to run its voice assistant Siri. Elon Musk’s xAI raised $10 billion to upgrade its infrastructure to stay in the game. And Baidu has open-sourced its Ernie AI model in a bid to take on OpenAI. Can Intel survive? Dave Vellante and David Floyer think new CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s plan has a chance, but a lot still has to go right — including some downsized ambitions, the latest of which is that it’s looking at moving on from one of its fab processes. No sooner did Musk rake President Trump’s awful-for-every-reason budget bill and call the GOP the Porky Pig Party (for once he’s not wrong) than Trump said he’d maybe review Musk’s immigration status. Then Tesla’s stock tanked. The next day, Tesla deliveries plunged but not as much as investors feared, and shares rose 5%. More popcorn, please! Cybersecurity firm Cato Networks raised a massive $359 million late-stage funding round, as consolidation in the industry continued. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finally closed its acquisition of Juniper Networks after getting the green light from the Justice Department.

Title: Report: Microsoft's 2025 layoffs revolve around its desperate $80 billion AI infrastructure investment
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/report-microsofts-2025-layoffs-revolve-around-its-desperate-usd80-billion-ai-infrastructure-investment
Time Published: 2025-07-03T22:35:51Z

The Redmond giant has laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, and a report claims it's all in the name of freeing up spending money to invest more heavily in AI infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-growing AI bubble. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft initiated yet another round of layoffs this week, impacting multiple organizations including gaming, sales, and marketing. Over 9,000 employees were cut, on top of the 6,000 that took place back in May. That means the Redmond giant has laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025 alone, and it's all to fund more AI infrastructure. According to a report from The Seattle Times, Microsoft is moving to reduce headcount to free up more capital for AI spending. Specifically, the company is looking to invest more money in AI infrastructure and technologies, and is making various cuts across many organizations and divisions to fund these efforts. "Microsoft’s push into AI doesn’t mean the company is replacing workers with the technology. Rather, the significant cost of building out the infrastructure over multiple years has Microsoft looking to trim costs where it can," The Seattle Times reports. That said, a chunk of the roles Microsoft has laid off in recent months were roles that could be aided by AI technology. The company has invested heavily in AI technology that can debug and write code and is reportedly planning to make AI use mandatory with checks to ensure this conducted in performance reviews. Microsoft has announced that it intends to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure in the coming year to keep pace with the rest of the AI bubble. This is up $25 billion over the previous fiscal year. In recent weeks, reports have suggested that Microsoft and OpenAI's multibillion dollar partnership has become strained as both companies seek different things. It should be clear to anyone following Microsoft closely that the company has become AI crazed in the last two years. Since 2023, Microsoft has rushed to implement AI technology in as many products and services as it can, regardless of whether that technology is ready for mainstream use. The recent layoffs amassing over 15,000 people come as Microsoft signs off one of its best years ever financially. The company has soared ahead of Apple in market cap, and is trailing NVIDIA as most valuable company in the world. Investing heavily in AI infrastructure and products at the cost of everything else is proving popular amongst shareholders. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told employees that despite layoffs, the Xbox "platform, hardware, and game roadmap [has] never looked stronger." Microsoft scrapped two in-development game projects as part of its most recent wave of layoffs, all to make room for more AI infrastructure it seems. Ultimately, the recent layoffs have left a foul taste in a lot of people's mouths. And it's not just Microsoft, though it appears to have laid off a considerable amount in 2025 alone. Layoffs have hit everyone from Meta to Amazon, impacting over 50,000 jobs in tech across hundreds of companies, many of which are reporting record profits. Unfortunately, this wave of layoffs doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already hinted that the company expects to reduce headcount in the next few years as AI becomes more adopted internally. It's unlikely Amazon will be alone in this thinking. What are your thoughts on the current health of Microsoft in the AI tech space and recent mass layoffs? Let us know in the comments.

Title: Nvidia Briefly Became Most Valuable Company Ever

Nvidia reportedly became the most valuable company ever for a period of time Thursday (July 3) morning before slipping below that mark later in the day.

Δ The artificial intelligence chip designer’s market capitalization rose as high as $3.92 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s record closing value of $3.915 trillion on Dec. 26, 2024, Reuters reported Thursday. Nvidia’s market cap dipped to $3.89 trillion later Thursday, according to the report. The company still has the largest market value at this time, with Microsoft ranked second at $3.7 trillion and Apple third at $3.19 trillion, the report said. The report attributed Nvidia’s surge to Wall Street’s continued optimism about AI; tech giants’ demand for the company’s products, which they need to build their AI data centers; and Nvidia’s relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation. Nvidia’s market cap has increased nearly eightfold over the past four years, according to the report. The firm’s stock has rebounded from its recently closing low on April 4, which was attributed to the announcements of new tariffs in the United States that were made at that time, per the report. When Nvidia’s market cap hit what was then its all-time high on June 25, Bloomberg reported that the company faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China but also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building AI infrastructure. During a May 28 earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said new U.S. export controls have effectively “closed” the $50 billion Chinese market to American companies. Despite that setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet demand for AI workloads. The company is doing so because demand for AI inference — the AI workloads in which new data is applied to trained models to generate outputs — is soaring. Other areas of growth include enterprise and industrial AI, and Nvidia has solutions for both, Huang said during the call. When Apple’s market capitalization surged in late December, analysts attributed the rise to the company’s involvement with AI and an expectation that the technology would lead to a wave of consumers deciding to upgrade their phones at once.

Title: Microsoft to cut about four percent of jobs amid hefty AI bets

Time Published: 2025-07-03T20:32:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft has confirmed it will lay off nearly 4 percent of its workforce as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged US$80 billion (A$122 billion) in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft has now planned to reduce organisational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on July 2. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10 percent of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Microsoft confirmed to Reuters that its gaming division was impacted by the layoffs, although not the majority of the unit, but did not provide further details. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5 percent of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across large corporations spanning multiple sectors in recent months as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against financial pressures.

Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5 percent of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across large corporations spanning multiple sectors in recent months as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against financial pressures.

Microsoft has confirmed it will lay off nearly 4 percent of its workforce as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged US$80 billion (A$122 billion) in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft has now planned to reduce organisational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on July 2. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10 percent of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Microsoft confirmed to Reuters that its gaming division was impacted by the layoffs, although not the majority of the unit, but did not provide further details. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5 percent of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year.

Title: Microsoft's enshittification of Xbox, Surface, and even Windows itself, are by design — with greed and corner-cutting replacing innovation

With Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood placing unrealistic expectations on Xbox, Windows, and others — the damage is becoming increasingly untenable. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about how Xbox had turned a corner, following a decent Xbox Showcase and a firm commitment to hardware. Speculation had been swirling that Xbox will hand off its hardware aspirations to OEMs like ASUS, leaving first-party hardware teams and customers facing an uncertain future. Microsoft's gaming financials don't always look healthy on the face of it either, putting a dark cloud over the entire platform. How naive of me. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled that 9,000 were facing the axe, bringing the annual total to 15,300 or more. Many hundreds of those layoffs were at Xbox specifically, with cuts that seemingly fell indiscriminately across the entire portfolio. Staffers who had been at Xbox for a decade or more, personally responsible for millions of dollars in revenue, got the cut. Legendary leaders at major studios were culled, projects were shut down, and in one case, an entire studio was closed. There's a meme in the Xbox community about how "Xbox is dead" every five minutes, because of the non-stop roller coaster of changing strategies and inconsistent messaging Microsoft has foisted onto the customer base (and employees too) in recent years. Today, Microsoft announced that Helldivers 2 is coming to Xbox, and is the first-ever PlayStation published title on the platform. You couldn't really plan for more unfortunate timing. Xbox is dead, Xbox is alive, and so on. The thing is, this isn't unique to Xbox. It's applicable to every department at Microsoft all up. As of this year, I've been covering the Xbox, Windows, Surface, Windows Phone, and Microsoft beat for ten years. I came in as an amateur blogger, just an Xbox fan, with little knowledge of the tech business or business in general. I've learned a lot over the years, through all of the successes and mistakes, over-confidence and under confidence. Through it all, I'd always tried to hold on to fandom for Xbox for myself, the community, and the hobby in general — while remaining critical, and voicing the concerns of customers. We all rallied for bringing more Japanese games for Xbox, we called for boosted localization, and called for improvements to the Xbox PC experience. Microsoft delivered in varying degrees, but the staggering cadence of mixed messaging, changing strategies, and inconsistency is a disservice to both customers and employees alike. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. I'm joining many others in feeling that under CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood — being a "fan" for devs, potential employees, and customers alike — is becoming simply impossible. Microsoft as an entity feels directionless, changing strategies on a dime, and laying off thousands in its fickle wake. Sources who remain anonymous due to lack of authority to speak on internal matters have pointed the blame for yesterday's mammoth layoffs firmly at Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Hood's unrealistic fiscal expectations on Microsoft's subsequent divisions have created a culture of fear and doubt, ironically impacting productivity and thus profitability. There's sentiment among Microsoft staffers that many of the layoffs revolve around a broadening shift towards artificial intelligence, with executives and activist investor groups at the top growing increasingly concerned that Microsoft is losing, or may have even already lost, the AI race. It's well-documented that OpenAI and Microsoft's partnership is fractured, with OpenAI desperate to free itself from the restrictions its early investment deal with Microsoft have placed upon it. Microsoft enjoys exclusivity to various aspects of OpenAI's operation, including the first-right-of-refusal to hosting AI workloads, on top of revenue sharing requirements. OpenAI no longer grants Microsoft exclusive rights to hosting its services, however. And furthermore, all of these deals have an imminent expiry date: 2030. To that end, investors are nervous that all of Microsoft's AI "success" hinges solely on OpenAI, who is also bleeding talent to Meta at an alarming rate. At this nascent stage, it's not unrealistic to think a major breakthrough at a competing platform, particularly at a company like Meta whose social apps remain globally dominant, could completely unravel OpenAI at a moment's notice. Microsoft's position in AI would evaporate overnight, conceding the future of computing to other tech companies. Microsoft's home-grown AI products, many of which rely on OpenAI models anyway, are by and large complete trash in practice. Copilot is a stunted version of ChatGPT, the "Microsoft 365 Copilot" disaster is painfully limited in scope. Even bare-bones basics like generative erase in the Photos app pale in comparison to Samsung's, and Microsoft's internal efforts have nothing to show but tech demos and promises, with no real products. The only "real" product Microsoft has put out so far, Windows Recall, is almost universally hated as a privacy nightmare made manifest, despite changes Microsoft has attempted to make. The Copilot+ PC range that its tied to has been nothing short of a spectacular flop, while sacrificing the Surface brand in the process. It's a testament to Xbox's leadership that it was able to convince Microsoft to invest in Activision when it had the chance, because I'd be willing to bet that Satya Nadella and Amy Hood would have sacrificed all of Xbox to chase this latest AI splurge without it. There's sentiment that Microsoft executives and activist shareholders resent the idea that investment had fallen towards Call of Duty and Activision-Blizzard, instead of broadening their early AI investments. Microsoft is set to invest a similarly mammoth-esque $80 billion in new AI-enabled training centers around the world to try and turn its fortunes around, but what if it had had $160 billion from having not purchased Activision? These latest layoffs are funding this refreshed attempt to chase an external innovation, and represent the human cost of Microsoft's poor planning. Quick edit: since I wrote this, I saw that The Seattle Times has corroborated that these layoffs revolve around this $80 billion AI infrastructure investment, foisted on Xbox and other departments to account for the jitters around the potential failure of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI. Indeed, it's a testament to Xbox's leadership that it was able to convince Microsoft to invest in Activision when it had the chance, because I'd be willing to bet that Satya Nadella and Amy Hood would have sacrificed all of Xbox to chase AI without it. From Surface to Windows Phone, to Xbox and Windows itself, under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has utterly forgotten that real humans, customers, actually use its products. And seemingly, that real humans, actually build its products. When the Windows Recall privacy PR disaster happened last year, I sat to myself thinking "how in the fuck couldn't someone have seen this coming?" It was literally the first thing I thought of when I saw that Microsoft was putting out an app that would creepily watch everything on your screen. It screamed of product design by spreadsheet — the "people use AI, so AI good" brainchild of a mindless boardroom meeting that nobody in the room was really paying attention to. The entire Copilot+ PC range screams of this, utterly uninspired, underbaked and unthoughtful approach that has typified Surface since product architects Panos Panay and Ralf Groene were sadly driven out of the company, as Panay rebuilds his all-star team at Amazon instead. Surface used to be at the cutting edge of hardware innovation, producing head-turning products that even Apple itself couldn't ignore. And sure, the execution wasn't always on point. Under Panos Panay, Surface had become a reliable fixture of Microsoft's product calendar, and drove a wave of innovation and improved designs across Windows' entire OEM portfolio. In 2025, that's all but gone — a shell of its former self, with Microsoft using Surface as a vehicle to placate whatever latest tech fad Satya Nadella finds himself interested in at the time. There's nobody driving real innovation at Surface anymore, and it's sad. Windows Mixed Reality, the "metaverse" buzzword from 2023, Windows Phone, Microsoft Band, even Microsoft's painfully slow efforts with Windows on Arm compatibility — under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has this strange and uncanny ability to put out loud PR beats and then utterly under-invest and thus, under-deliver. We're seeing the same situation play out now with Copilot in slow motion, although that $80 billion investment is nothing to scoff at — it sounds like it's more about supporting other's services rather than Microsoft's own innovations. Microsoft Build events used to be a legendary confluence of developer passion and consumer product innovation, with exciting product reveals and service enhancements. Now, it's a dull parade of investor bait that typifies Nadella's approach to the company. Therein lies why I say Microsoft is now more of an investment bank than a product innovator. Like locusts, Microsoft's fiscal approach has been to swarm into a section with money and acquisitions. Then, under-invest and under-deliver, subsequently ruin the product, and then bail when the next over-hyped tech fad opportunity rolls around. This is before we talk about things like cutting corners around security, leading to the unprecedented Azure email hack, among other things. There's a litany of examples of this dating back across my entire career, and even further back before it. The brunt of this week's layoffs weren't in Xbox, but I don't see how Xbox can thrive in the corporate environment being constructed by Amy Hood and Satya Nadella, where investment mentality supersedes customer confidence, and employee wellbeing. But the cash keeps rolling in, so none of it matters, seemingly. I've been critical of Microsoft corporate for years, but Xbox enjoyed a bit of a bubble while Microsoft from the top largely ignored its operations. That was until Activision-Blizzard, of course. My naivete as an modern Xbox fan hit a turning point during Summer Game Fest this year. For most of my career, to my knowledge, Microsoft had these Xbox FanFest events at its shows like Gamescom and E3, where dozens, and even hundreds of fans were invited to participate in events. Microsoft wilfully and actively engaged in curating community fandom in this way, and it has done so in the past with Windows Phone, Surface, and other products. This year at Summer Game Fest, Microsoft had no Xbox FanFest of its own. But those who had been attending for years, and enjoyed the community and camaraderie, pooled and spent their own money to curate an Xbox FanFest event in LA. On the one hand, it was awesome to see the community rally, but on the other, it was utterly disappointing that Microsoft itself wouldn't spare the cash. Microsoft is approaching a 4 trillion-dollar market capitalization, with $22 billion in profits last quarter. They couldn't have spared a few thousand to put together an event for fans this year? Couldn't Satya Nadella have thrown a few dollars in from his $79 million stock awards package last year? One week ago at this time, myself, @benkenobi2020 , @DonteJMoody @Porshapwr Hargeet, @FonzGaming, @shaunlabrie @webdave @corkenstein @MrboomstickXL were getting the venue ready for Xbox Community Watch Party. Nerves were high as well as Stress. It was all worth it and a very… pic.twitter.com/9YwEFkXvjAJune 14, 2025 In among the mixed messaging over Xbox exclusives, the lack of clarity on Xbox's future — it was that that really didn't sit right with me. I'd tell myself it was all just a transition, with spending squeezed and playtime hours down ... The vast majority of gaming hours and spend sent into Fortnite and Roblox, and economic confidence hitting new lows. But then came this week's layoffs. These latest layoffs seem utterly indiscriminate — an overly aggressive and reductive move purely aimed to boost margins at the cost of everyone and everything else. Entire teams wiped out, families left to wonder what their future would look like. People who'd given huge chunks of their lives, blood sweat and tears, toward helping make Microsoft shareholders and execs rich. Friends who'd worked together for years, and worked with devs, fans, and press for years — some of whom were personally responsible for millions of dollars in revenue that helped shareholders get richer. I know it's not as if other companies haven't had layoffs, and I know that Xbox has things cooking. But I feel like it's in spite of Microsoft, rather than because of Microsoft. When you look at Microsoft's other products, like Windows 11, Surface, and even further back — the empty promises, the rug pulls, and broken promises, it screams to me of a company that simply isn't willing to take a risk, or give products the time they need to shine. Microsoft as an entity no longer has any real direction, and no conviction, and crucially, no willingness to actually compete. Microsoft represents the apex of late stage capitalism, where failure is rewarded, and the ability to shift capital rapidly voids the necessity to deliver for consumers and society in general. Microsoft increasingly just seems to go where other companies, true innovators, say the money is — looking for the next fad to devour and process, rather than curate and cultivate. How will Xbox, Surface, or Windows 11, grow without risk, investment, and curating consumer confidence? In a world where Microsoft has enough capital to just move wherever the wind is blowing, it simply doesn't seem to care. It doesn't have to be this way. The brutality of these layoffs is just another symptom of a sick money-first mentality. But how can you stop it? Microsoft employs hundreds of thousands of people, none of whom deserve to be in this position either, and most of whom aren't paid well enough for their hard work. Most of whom simply want to do great things and create great experiences and art, as Microsoft corporate works their hardest to stop them. Microsoft is a company that has no real mission or ethos anymore, and one that behaves more like a bank than a tech company, and it is certainly not one that deserves "fans." Maybe it never did. In any case, Microsoft is making more money than God right now. So, I guess it just doesn't matter. And ... maybe it never did. Edit: I had previously blamed Microsoft for its response to the Crowdstrike situation too in an upper segment here, but Microsoft granting kernel access to vendors was a result of European Union legislation, not as a result of outsourcing security. Apologies for that. But, there are plenty of other examples where Microsoft's security investments have been lacking, and have been blamed on corner cutting and putting profits first.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Your Echo device is more versatile than you think. These Alexa commands can save you time and make daily life more manageable. Make the most of your Echo devices with these Alexa commands. Since its arrival in 2014, Alexa has changed drastically from the voice assistant that was originally released. Instead of being an easier way to trigger music, or add to your to-do list, it's now an effective tool for managing all the different parts of your busy life. With the addition of new AI-powered features from Alexa Plus, your favorite voice assistant is more capable than ever. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a compelling tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now's a good time to see how much more useful it's become with AI-powered features now available. Though a recent CNET survey found that 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, Alexa was the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Nvidia (NVDA) could be poised to claim the title of most valuable company in history, as its market value nears $4 trillion. The AI chipmaker's shares rose just over 1% to close at an all-time high of $159.34 Thursday, pushing its market capitalization to $3.89 trillion. If the stock had sustained its intraday highs closer to $161, its market value would have topped Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion in December. With another roughly 3% rise from Thursday's closing price to $163.93, Nvidia could also hit the $4 trillion market cap threshold soon, something no other company has done. Microsoft (MSFT), which has jockeyed with Nvidia this year for the title of world's most valuable company, could too, according to Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives. “We believe both Nvidia and Microsoft will hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club....as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI Revolution," the analysts said in a note to clients Thursday. Thursday's rise came amid broader market gains, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting all-time highs ahead of a long holiday weekend. The stock market closed early at 1 p.m. ET Thursday ahead of the July 4 holiday on Friday.

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI! In this edition...Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence…Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance…Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up…Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. As an early-summer heat wave blanketed my home state of New Jersey last week, it felt like perfect timing to stumble across a sobering new prediction from Accenture: AI data centers’ carbon emissions are on track to surge 11-fold by 2030. The report estimates that over the next five years, AI data centers could consume 612 terawatt-hours of electricity—roughly equivalent to Canada’s total annual power consumption—driving a 3.4% increase in global carbon emissions. And the strain doesn’t stop at the power grid. At a time when freshwater resources are already under severe pressure, AI data centers are also projected to consume more than 3 billion cubic meters of water per year—a volume that surpasses the annual freshwater withdrawals of entire countries like Norway or Sweden. Unsurprisingly, the report—Powering Sustainable AI—offers recommendations for how to rein in the problem and prevent those numbers from becoming reality. But with near-daily headlines about Big Tech’s massive AI data center buildouts across the U.S. and worldwide, I can’t help but feel cynical. The urgent framing of an AI race against China doesn’t seem to leave much room—or time—for serious thinking about sustainability. Just yesterday, for example, OpenAI agreed to rent a massive amount of computing power from Oracle data centers as part of its Stargate initiative, which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. The additional capacity from Oracle totals about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the U.S., according to Bloomberg reporting. A gigawatt is akin to the capacity from one nuclear reactor and can provide electricity to roughly 750,000 houses. And this week, Meta was reported to be seeking to raise $29 billion from private capital firms to build AI data centers in the U.S., while already building a $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana. As part of that deal, the local utility, Entergy, will supply three new power plants. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made his intentions clear: The U.S. must rapidly expand AI data center construction or risk falling behind China in the race for AI dominance. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast in May, he warned that America’s edge in artificial intelligence could erode unless it keeps pace with China’s aggressive build-out of data center capacity and factory-scale hardware. “The U.S. really needs to focus on streamlining the ability to build data centers and produce energy,” Zuckerberg said. “Otherwise, we’ll be at a significant disadvantage.” The U.S. government seems to be aligned with that sense of urgency. David Sacks, now serving as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, has also underscored that energy and data center expansion are central to America’s AI strategy—leaving little room for sustainability concerns. On his All In podcast in February, Sacks argued that Washington’s “go-slow” approach to AI could strangle the industry. He emphasized that the U.S. needs to clear the way for infrastructure and energy development—including AI data centers—to keep pace with China. In late May, he went further, saying that streamlining permitting and expanding power generation are essential for AI’s future—something he claimed has been “effectively impossible under the Biden administration.” His message: the U.S. needs to race to build faster. Accenture, meanwhile, is urging its clients to responsibly grow and engineer its AI data centers in a bid to balance growth with environmental responsibility. It is offering a new metric, that it calls the Sustainable AI Quotient (SAIQ), to measure the true costs of AI in terms of money invested, megawatt-hours of energy consumed, tons of CO₂ emitted and cubic meters of water used. The firm’s report says the metric will help organizations answer a basic question: “What are we actually getting from the resources we’re investing in AI?” and allow that enterprise to measure its performance across time. I spoke to Matthew Robinson, managing director of Accenture Research and co-author of the report, who emphasized that he hoped Accenture’s sobering predictions would be proven wrong. “They kind of take your breath away,” he said, explaining that Accenture modeled future energy consumption from the expected number of installed AI chips adjusted for utilization and the additional energy requirements of data centers. That data was combined with regional data on electricity generation, energy mix and emissions, while water use was assessed based on AI data center energy consumption and how much water is consumed per unit of electricity generated. “The point really is to open the conversation around the actions that are available to avert this pathway—we don’t want to be right here,” he said. He would not comment on the actions of specific companies like OpenAI or Meta, but said that overall, clearly more effort is needed to avert the rise in carbonisation fueled by AI data centers while still allowing for growth. Accenture’s recommendations certainly make sense: Optimize the power efficiency of AI workloads and data centers with everything from low-carbon energy options to cooling innovations. Use AI thoughtfully, by choosing smaller AI models, and better pricing models for incentivizing efficiency. And ensure better governance over AI sustainability initiatives. It’s hard to imagine that the biggest players in the race for AI dominance—Big Tech giants and heavily funded startups—will hit the brakes long enough to seriously address these growing concerns. Not that it’s impossible. Take Google, for example: In its latest sustainability report released this week, the company revealed that its data centers are consuming more power than ever. In 2024, Google used approximately 32.1 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, with a staggering 95.8%—about 30.8 million MWh—consumed by its data centers. That’s more than double the energy its data centers used in 2020, just before the consumer AI boom. Still, Google emphasized that it’s making meaningful strides toward cleaning up its energy supply, even as demand surges. The company said it cut its data center energy emissions by 12% in 2024, thanks to clean energy projects and efficiency upgrades. And it’s squeezing more out of every watt. Google reported that the amount of compute per unit of electricity has increased about six-fold over the past five years. Its power usage effectiveness (PUE)—a key measure of data center efficiency—is now approaching the theoretical minimum of 1.0, with a reported PUE of 1.09 in 2024. “Just speaking personally, I’d be optimistic,” said Robinson. Note: Check out this new Fortune video about my tour of IBM’s quantum computing test lab. I had a fabulous time hanging out at IBM’s Yorktown Heights campus (a midcentury modern marvel designed by the same guy as the St. Louis Arch and the classic TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport) in New York. The video was part of my coverage for this year’s Fortune 500 issue that included an article that dug deep into IBM’s recent rebound. As I said in my piece, “walking through the IBM research center is like stepping into two worlds at once. There are the steel and glass curves of Saarinen’s design, punctuated by massive walls made of stones collected from the surrounding fields, with original Eames chairs dotting discussion nooks. But this 20th-century modernism contrasts starkly with the sleek, massive, refrigerator-like quantum computer—among the most advanced in the world—that anchors the collaboration area and working lab, where it whooshes with the steady hum of its cooling system.” With that, here’s the rest of the AI news. Sharon Goldmansharon.goldman@fortune.com@sharongoldman Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence, after Daniel Gross steps down to join Meta. Ilya Sutskever, the former OpenAI chief scientist who founded Safe Superintelligence (SSI) with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy a year ago, confirmed that he will now serve as SSI’s CEO after Daniel Gross stepped down. Sustkever posted on X saying: “Daniel Gross’s time with us has been winding down, and as of June 29 he is officially no longer a part of SSI. We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next endeavor. I am now formally CEO of SSI, and Daniel Levy is President. The technical team continues to report to me. ⁠You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through.” Meta was rumored to have sought to acquire the $32 billion-valued SSI. Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese artificial intelligence companies are gaining ground globally, challenging U.S. supremacy and intensifying a potential AI arms race. Across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, organizations—from multinational banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered to Saudi Aramco—are increasingly adopting large language models from Chinese firms such as DeepSeek and Alibaba as alternatives to U.S. offerings like ChatGPT. Even American cloud giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google now offer access to DeepSeek’s models, despite U.S. government security restrictions on the company’s apps. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT still leads in global adoption—with 910 million downloads versus DeepSeek’s 125 million—Chinese models are undercutting U.S. competition by offering nearly comparable performance at much lower prices. Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up. As Mark Zuckerberg rapidly staffs up Meta’s new superintelligence lab, his company has reportedly offered some OpenAI researchers eye-popping pay packages of up to $300 million over four years, with more than $100 million in first-year compensation, Wired reports. The offers, which include immediate stock vesting, have been extended to at least 10 OpenAI employees, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. While Meta’s aggressive recruiting tactics have caught the attention of top talent, some OpenAI staffers told Wired they’re weighing the massive payouts against their potential impact at Meta versus staying at OpenAI. A Meta spokesperson pushed back, claiming reports of the offer sizes are exaggerated. Still, even Meta’s senior engineers typically make around $850,000 per year, with those in higher pay bands earning over $1.5 million annually, according to Levels.FYI data. Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. Microsoft’s sales chief, Judson Althoff, is reshaping the company’s sales organization to double down on AI, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. Althoff’s Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) unit will now focus on embedding Copilot across devices and roles, deepening Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 adoption, winning high-impact AI deals, expanding Azure cloud migration, and strengthening cybersecurity to support AI growth. The memo, sent just one day before Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs—many of which affected Althoff’s sales teams—outlined his vision to make Microsoft “the Frontier AI Firm.” According to Business Insider, this restructuring follows Althoff’s earlier plan to cut the number of sales solution areas in half starting this fiscal year.

That’s how much U.S. investment in AI companies soared to in the first quarter of this year—a 33% jump from the previous quarter and a staggering 550% increase compared to the quarter before ChatGPT’s 2022 debut, according to PitchBook. The biggest price tag? Data centers. The New York Times reports that Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google plan to spend a combined $320 billion on infrastructure this year—more than double what they spent just two years ago. A huge chunk of that will go toward building new data centers to keep up with the exploding demand for AI. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Report: Microsoft tying to move towards AI agents amid mass layoffs

Time Published: 2025-07-03T15:26:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft is going through another round of mass layoffs with 9,000 employees in various divisions being let go. While the management has called these layoffs organizational changes, a new report citing a developer with knowledge of the situation claims that Microsoft is looking to replace its human workforce with AI. Speaking at Meta’s inaugural LlamaCon AI developer event in May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had shared that about 30% of the company’s code is written by AI. Now, it looks like the company is going full steam ahead with AI integration and this could have something to do with the recent mass layoffs. A report by Engadget citing a developer at Microsoft who also received the memo from Phil Spencer, but supposedly was not let go, shared that management is “trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents." While the report does not elaborate on this claim, the memo stated “increase agility and effectiveness” as one of the reasons for the layoffs. If implemented correctly, AI agents can significantly optimize various workflows so the developer’s claim of Microsoft trying to replace human workers with AI agents surely has weight to it. This has become an industry trend as even Amazon had recently issued a memo to its employees stating that AI agents will replace some human jobs. Furthermore, the developer also shared his anger about the memo and the current situation of development at Microsoft. “I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about,” the developer reportedly told Engadget. They added that employees at Microsoft are not happy about the quality of the product and that a lot of pep talk is being used to try and up the morale. It should be noted that Microsoft has not associated AI agents with the mass layoffs but considering the AI-written code, using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and other AI related internal implementations, AI agents seem to be the end goal for the company.

Nvidia was on track to become the most valuable company in history today, with the chipmaker's market capitalisation reaching $3.92 trillion as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2% at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5% to $498.5. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US.stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4% on the benchmark S&P 500. AI poster child Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © RTÉ 2025.

Microsoft is cutting more jobs as it continues AI push When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is cutting 9,000 jobs with most of those facing the ax being employed in the Gaming division. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said (via CNBC). The job cuts seek to reduce the layers of managers standing between individual contributors and top executives, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. Cutting jobs seems to be the growing trend for many large companies, with Microsoft cutting just under 1% of its workforce in January 2025. Another 6,000 workers, mostly programmers, were cut in May and a further 300 jobs cut in June. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.” Amazon has also gone through several waves of layoffs this year, with CEO Andy Jassy repeatedly saying that AI could replace some of its workers.

For Microsoft though, the layoffs are more to do with improving business performance and reducing internal friction. Intel has also lined up a significant wave of layoffs, with the company looking to cut 15-20% of its factory workforce. Intel already laid off 15,000 people in August 2024. But while Intel has been struggling with declining revenues and market performance, Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter.

Title: Apple’s Big AI Bet: Could Perplexity Be A Game Changer?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/07/03/apples-big-ai-bet-could-perplexity-be-a-game-changer/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T11:59:17Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. Apple and Artificial Intelligence Apple’s stock is down nearly 20% so far in 2025, making it the only Magnificent Seven member in the red. Acquiring Perplexity AI, a leading AI search engine, could immediately boost investor confidence and give Apple a chance to seize AI leadership. The stakes are clear: On June 28, 2025, Bloomberg revealed that Apple's M&A chief, Adrian Perica, had discussed acquiring Perplexity with services head Eddy Cue. Analysts estimate such a deal could cost between $25 and $30 billion, roughly twice Perplexity's last funding round valuation, and consistent with recent acquisition premiums paid for strategic AI properties. Days later, reports emerged that Apple is also weighing partnerships with Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT to power a new Siri. Apple is racing to close its AI gap through whatever means necessary. Industry experts and Wall Street analysts believe a Perplexity deal could recast Apple as an AI orchestration leader, extend its high-margin services through renewed hardware demand, and potentially trigger a valuation rerating. Disclaimer: This article is based solely on publicly available information, market reports, and the author's independent research and analysis. The author has no insider contacts at Apple, Perplexity, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Samsung, or any other company mentioned, and no direct knowledge of their internal strategies, acquisition decisions, or future plans. All strategic interpretations are speculative and intended for informational purposes only. Apple is reportedly considering acquiring Perplexity AI not just to buy another chatbot, but to build what could become the world’s first consumer AI orchestration platform. Instead of forcing users to choose between ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Search, its system would automatically call upon the best model for each task. This embodies Apple's 'it just works' philosophy, delivering seamless, intelligent experiences that are intuitive, invisible, and effortlessly powerful. This isn’t just about catching up in AI. It’s about redefining how humans interact with it. Using intent recognition (understanding what the user wants—like checking the weather vs drafting an email) and query analysis (figuring out the best way to answer—like searching real-time data vs explaining a concept), the system routes requests in milliseconds. Here's how it could work: For example, ask, 'Should I invest in Apple stock?' Perplexity pulls the latest market data and analyst commentary, with citations. ChatGPT explains investing principles and risk factors in conversational language. Apple Intelligence then combines everything into one smart, personalized response. Whether you're asking Siri a question, pointing your camera at a landmark, or drafting an email, each AI model contributes its unique strength, fused into one unified experience. Daily examples of this ambient intelligence include: "What's the weather?" → Apple Intelligence delivers local results on-device; "Cancel my meeting politely." → ChatGPT drafts the diplomatic email; "Any new research on quantum computing?" → Perplexity surfaces the latest studies; "Set a timer for 10 minutes." → Apple Intelligence handles it privately, on-device. Personal data remains protected on-device, with only anonymized queries sent to external services when necessary. Users retain override control, but most interactions become ambient and invisible. If Apple pursues an orchestration strategy, it would likely rely on each AI partner playing a specialized role. ChatGPT excels at conversation, Claude at reasoning, and Perplexity at real-time, citation-backed search. Unlike general LLMs, Perplexity is an AI-native search engine specialized for real-time, citation-backed answers atop these models. Think of Perplexity as Google Search reimagined for the AI era. Instead of giving you a list of blue links to sift through, it delivers direct, citation-backed answers in clear, conversational language, summarizing multiple sources so you can decide intelligently what to explore further. It also provides cues on related topics worth investigating. For example, when you ask “Should I buy Coinbase stock?”, Perplexity doesn’t just list articles. It offers a structured, conversational analysis including current price, valuation ratios, Morningstar fair value, fundamental risks, technical ratings, and professional opinions—all in one place—followed by suggested related questions like options strategies, historical comparisons, and upcoming catalysts. The acquisition logic becomes clear when comparing alternatives. ChatGPT's $300 billion valuation makes acquisition prohibitive, while partnerships suffice for conversational needs. Claude, valued at $61.5 billion, could cost $80–90 billion with market premiums, unjustifiable when licensing suffices. At a $14 billion last funding round valuation, Perplexity is the attainable target, with specialized search capabilities and an orchestration-ready architecture that appears well-suited to Apple’s potential orchestration approach. Apple and Perplexity Currently, Perplexity generates just under $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), doubling from ~$50 million in late 2024—a fraction of its potential under Apple’s vast distribution and financial moat. With more than 2.2 billion active devices, a premium user base, and seamless payment infrastructure, its revenue baseline could expand dramatically. Even at a 30% conversion rate among more than 2.2 billion devices, priced at $15 to $20 per month, consumer revenue alone could reach $2.4 to $3.2 billion annually. Enterprise markets offer additional upside, as AI tools command premium pricing: Microsoft Copilot starts at $30 per user monthly, Lexis+ runs around $300–400 per attorney per month, Westlaw starts near $133 and rises for advanced tiers, and Bloomberg Law costs roughly $6,000 per lawyer annually. Law firms spend up to $21,000 per attorney on specialized research tools, while major universities allocate up to $12.5 million annually to digital resources. Pre-installed across Apple’s ecosystem, Perplexity would gain instant reach unmatched by competitors, transforming it from a standalone service into a defensible, multibillion-dollar AI search powerhouse. Combined consumer and enterprise potential creates a clear path to recovering the estimated $30 billion acquisition cost within a decade or sooner, and could catapult Apple onto offense rather than leaving it on the defensive. Apple's current partnership with ChatGPT illustrates the limitations of relying on external AI providers. Each query requires user permission, incurs per-request costs, and faces security restrictions and delays due to routing through external providers. More importantly, these models cannot fully leverage Apple's Neural Engine architecture to deliver optimal performance. The Microsoft–OpenAI relationship offers a cautionary parallel. Despite Microsoft’s $13 billion investment, strategic tensions have emerged as it now competes directly with OpenAI in search, coding, and enterprise AI services. OpenAI has even considered filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft, and ongoing governance disputes continue to hinder both companies' strategic goals. Acquiring Perplexity AI could avoid these partnership pitfalls while delivering four key advantages. Seamless integration could eliminate permission prompts for factual queries, remove external API dependencies, and reduce latency through direct local processing. Hardware optimization could allow Perplexity's search models to run natively on Apple's M4 Neural Engine, minimizing network delays while maintaining privacy through unified memory architecture. The deal could also provide immediate talent acquisition—Apple would instantly gain proven AI experts who've already built a successful search-AI hybrid at scale. This specialized expertise could become crucial as Siri improvements remain delayed until at least 2026. Moreover, top talent attracts top talent: having Perplexity's team in-house could significantly enhance Apple's ability to recruit other leading AI researchers. Finally, cost efficiency could emerge from owning the highest-volume use case—factual queries—allowing Apple to avoid per-API-call expenses while continuing to license specialized conversational models only where necessary. This orchestration approach creates multiple competitive advantages: For users: No more wondering which AI tool to download or try, or AI app hopping. Just ask and get the best answer from whichever AI knows best. For Apple: It could deliver the unified experiences users expect from Apple and create true platform differentiation. While Android users juggle separate apps, iPhone users could get everything integrated intelligently. For competitors: In the face of Apple’s seamless AI orchestration, their offerings may quickly feel outdated and like disjointed point solutions. Microsoft’s Copilot could seem bolted-on, Google’s AI Overviews might remain limited to a single Gemini-driven perspective, and Meta could continue focusing mainly on social features. Just as the iPhone transformed how we used phones, Apple’s orchestration could transform how we use AI. On the other hand, if rivals like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon were to acquire Perplexity instead, they could embed it deeply at the OS level, leaving Apple to continue developing such solutions in-house, where it has seen only limited success so far. Acquiring Perplexity could put Apple on a fast track to deliver the premium “wow” experiences it is known for, securing advantages that could be extremely costly for competitors to counter. Samsung's reported partnership discussions with Perplexity this year add immediate pressure. Preferential Android access could not only weaken Apple's differentiation but also drive Perplexity's acquisition cost even higher. While Apple is late to AI, monetization remains largely unproven across the industry, giving it a rare chance to leapfrog competitors by executing orchestration better than anyone else. The challenges are significant. Bringing together multiple AI systems at Apple's scale will be an enormous engineering lift. Orchestrating requests in milliseconds without glitches demands flawless backend architecture. Apple's brand is built on privacy: even anonymized external queries could trigger user concerns if transparency isn't crystal clear. With Siri upgrades delayed to 2026, a 12 to 18-month Perplexity integration risks missing the AI wave entirely if rivals move faster. The estimated $30 billion price tag could rise further if other bidders enter the fray. These risks are real, but with AI becoming the next battleground, Apple may have no choice but to tackle them head-on if it wants to become a leader. The stakes are high. This move could trigger a valuation rerating and preserve Apple’s leadership in the next tech battleground. However, delay or indecision risks ceding ground to rivals and forfeiting a valuable strategic edge. This orchestration bet could redefine human-AI interaction, but only if Apple acts decisively before the window closes.

Title: How Lam Research Stock Gets To $200
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/03/how-lam-research-stock-gets-to-200/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T10:30:10Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Lam Research Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a prominent supplier of equipment for chip fabrication, is poised to gain from the increasing capital expenditures driven by the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence industry. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) grabs attention with its stock price soaring more than 3 times over the last two years and its valuation approaching $4 trillion, less known companies like Lam play an essential role in the manufacturing of the AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks may provide a more stable value with significant potential for upside. The data is persuasive. According to SEMI, capital expenditure on advanced chip-making equipment is expected to nearly double from 2023 to 2028, and global capex spending is anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Lam, which focuses on deposition and etching equipment—two of the foremost processes in chip production—may be well-positioned to seize a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s primary clients include industry titans like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, establishing it as a key player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Although traditionally dominant in memory chips, Lam is broadening its footprint in advanced logic chips and packaging technologies—fields that are witnessing increasing demand as chip design complexity escalates. AI tasks require not just advanced processing power but also high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and intricate stacking architectures. For instance, the fabrication of HBM chips is three times more wafer-intensive than standard DRAM because of lower bit density and the requirement for 3D stacking. This results in a direct increase in demand for tools manufactured by companies like Lam. Whereas chip designers such as Nvidia have experienced skyrocketing valuations, Lam's stock has lagged. Shares have decreased by approximately 9% over the past 12 months and presently trade at around 24 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 35 times. Indeed, the valuation disparity is partly attributable to Lam’s reliance on China, which represented 31% of revenues in the March quarter. Ongoing U.S. export restrictions have impacted this segment, likely restricting Lam's capacity to capitalize on the substantial Chinese market. According to consensus estimates, Lam's revenues are projected to grow by around 22% in FY25, although growth is expected to cool to roughly 2% in FY’26, in part due to these China-related challenges, with earnings also expected to remain flat. Nonetheless, if heightened demand related to AI, combined with a possible relaxation of chip equipment export restrictions to China, leads to sustained revenue growth at FY’25 rates of about 22% annually over the next three years, Lam's revenue could increase by around 1.8 times. Even if profit margins stay near current levels of 27% (as recorded over the first nine months of FY25), and if the valuation multiple rises to about 30 times (up from 24 times currently, a 1.25 times growth), the stock could potentially double from the current price of approximately $97 to over $200 per share. Several scenarios could lead to this outcome. Last week, the U.S. and China established a trade framework that encompasses rare earth exports and a potential relaxation of technology restrictions. If this easing of tensions applies to chip equipment exports, companies like Lam might gain renewed access to a vital growth market, further enhancing revenues. Furthermore, the process of chip manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital-intensive, meaning that a larger portion of the chip's expense is now equipment-related—a distinct advantage for companies like Lam. Additionally, advanced packaging methods, such as stacking and connecting multiple chips, which are already being used for AI tasks, should boost the demand for Lam’s high-end machinery. Certainly, Lam faces significant risks. Beyond the China issue, the memory chip arena, where Lam has historically excelled, is encountering pricing pressures. Flash memory prices have been declining due to decreased demand from consumer markets and capex in this sector has been subdued as key players reduce production. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, and U.S. tariffs could further obscure Lam’s short-term growth prospects. Although Lam is a highly specialized company with robust intellectual property, it may not enjoy the same protective barrier as a firm like ASML, which essentially has a monopoly over its trade of extreme ultraviolet lithography. On the other hand, Lam faces numerous competitors, such as Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron, which also provide similar services. That said, the long-term upcycle appears to be secure. The global semiconductor market is forecasted to surpass $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, rising from approximately $624 billion in 2024 according to the Wall Street Journal. As chip manufacturers adopt next-generation technologies to enable AI, the demand for sophisticated manufacturing tools is likely to remain high, directly benefiting Lam. While investing in a single stock like LRCX entails risk, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an adaptive means to maximize the advantages of favorable market conditions while curbing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Good morning. If you’re in the habit of listening to CEOs, you’ll notice a new trend among leaders talking about AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent interview that AI now does up to 50% of all work at the company, in key functions like engineering, coding, and customer support. In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20% to 30% of the tech giant’s code is now written by AI coding assistants. And in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said over 30% of code at Google is now generated by AI. It’s the latest CEO flex: Citing numbers showing that AI is doing heavy lifting internally. The move presents the company as being ahead of the AI curve and invariably grabs the attention of people who matter. Investors hear the magic words that the business is on track to save money—presumably accomplished—but rarely explicitly stated, through future job cuts. It also signals to clients of the Big Tech companies making the pronouncements that they should open their wallets, pronto, to incorporate more AI into their operations, or risk falling behind. But how significant these CEO flexes ultimately are from Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft is difficult to know. The metrics cited seem precise, yet when asked, their spokespeople declined to provide any details about how the numbers were calculated or how they defined the work that they claim AI has done. “The truth is, we don’t yet have a common framework for measuring what ‘percent of work’ really means in the age of AI,” said Malvika Jethmalani, founder of human capital advisory firm Atvis Group, in a message to Fortune. “Are we counting lines of code, tasks completed, hours saved, or business outcomes influenced?” But Netherlands-based occupational psychologist Marais Bester thinks something else is afoot. “I think it’s also sort of an indicator to employees, saying, you better watch your back, you better perform.” From a business psychology standpoint, that’s not an indicator of good leadership, he added. Shonna Waters, an organizational psychologist and CEO of advisory firm Fractional Insights, thinks the companies that will succeed are those with “structural empathy”—that is, building systems that bring in frontline worker voices. “At the end of the day, you need the humans to still be the ones actually adopting the AI, you need to bring them along with your journey and figure out how to do it in concert with them, as opposed to something you’re doing to them.” You can read my full story for Fortune here. — Sharon Goldman More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill advances to final vote The debate went late into the night but expect the House to vote on the whole thing today. The president has not been happy with Congress’s delays. Axios has an interesting list of weird stuff that is in the gigantic act. FHFA head asks Congress to investigate Fed’s Powell Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, published a letter on X accusing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of giving deceptive testimony to Congress and demanding an investigation. President Trump then piled on with his own post calling for Powell to “resign immediately.” Reality check: Pulte did not provide specifics about what he believes Powell said wrongly. This is yet another extraordinary chapter in the book of Trump’s political tirades against his top central banker. Powell appears to have earned the president’s dislike simply because he has set monetary policy independently of the desires of the White House. CEOs are now openly saying AI will cut jobs The chief executives of Ford, Google, Amazon, Anthropic, and JPMorgan Chase have all openly stated that white-collar jobs will go into decline. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has said the company won’t hire new workers unless it can be proved that AI cannot do the job. Layoffs at Microsoft Microsoft is cutting around 9,000 jobs—almost 4% of its global workforce—in an effort to streamline operations and continue restructuring efforts. This is the biggest round of layoffs Microsoft has had since 2023. ADP says jobs declined The private sector is shrinking and lost 33,000 jobs last month, per a new report from ADP. “Though layoffs continue to be rare,” said ADP’s chief economist Nela Richardson, “a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month.” Vietnam strikes trade deal with the U.S. The U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the U.S. and goods that have been “transshipped” through Vietnam will face a 40% tax. Scaramucci’s second act Eight years after his disastrous 11-day stint as White House spokesperson, Anthony Scaramucci has remade his life as one of the most influential podcasters in politics and finance via his ability to read the room and draw together some of the world’s most powerful and influential people. Apple alleges former employee stole trade secrets Apple is suing a former senior product design engineer for allegedly stealing files with proprietary information about the $3,500 Vision Pro headset before leaving the company. Plus, Apple alleges that their former employee “was not honest about his stated reason for leaving Apple,” as his next job was at competitor Snap Inc. Goldman Sachs on employment: “We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 85k in June, below consensus of 110k and the three-month average of +135k. On the positive side, the end of worker strikes will provide a 6k boost. On the negative side, big data indicators were soft, we estimate the termination of Temporary Protected Status for approximately 350k Venezuelan migrants in mid-May will impose a 25k drag, and we expect a 15k decline in federal government payrolls. We estimate that the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3% on a rounded basis,” per Jan Hatzius et al. ‘Massive’ investment in R&D leads China’s Honor to launch world’s thinnest foldable phone by Nicholas Gordon Melinda French Gates tells Oprah Winfrey she runs every major life decision by her three closest female friends: ‘They are my truth council’ by Alexa Mikhail Andy Jassy’s latest canvas for reinvigorating Amazon’s cultural DNA?

Microsoft is cutting jobs once again. After laying off some employees in the gaming division in January and around 6,000 employees across various verticals in May, the company on Wednesday confirmed to The Seattle Times that it is reducing its workforce once again by almost 4%. The latest round of layoffs is part of “organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Gizmodo. Microsoft hasn’t confirmed which departments are affected or how many employees have been let go. The Redmond-based company had 228,000 employees as of June 2024. After reducing the recent job cuts, 4% of the workforce would translate to nearly 9,000 employees. Gaming is among the departments that have taken a major hit. “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Xbox leader Phil Spencer writes in a memo to employees, viewed by IGN. Those affected will be contacted by HR and be provided with severance benefits as required by local laws, including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, Spencer notes. Those eliminated from Xbox can apply for open roles across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority, he adds. Following Spencer’s statement, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty confirmed to employees that it would be cancelling the development of games like Everwild, Perfect Dark, and several other announced projects. These developments follow a Bloomberg report from last month that said thousands of Microsoft jobs would be cut after the end of the fiscal year in June. That report suggested marketing and sales teams could take the biggest hit; however, the latest reports indicate gaming has been affected more than other departments. We have reached out to Microsoft for further clarification regarding the departments affected and the number of workers let go. The months and years ahead may continue to be tough for tech employees. Intel is planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles, while Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already warned employees that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer in the next few years.

Title: Space comms reaches commercialisation inflection point

Time Published: 2025-07-03T07:30:00Z

Ubotica Research from the GSMA has found that the satellite-based communications industry is now transitioning from the pilot and validation stage to initial commercial deployments, with 109 telco-satellite partnerships now covering 70% of global mobile subscribers, and commercialisation set to unfold over the next two to three years as services evolve from SMS to voice to data. The Satellite and NTN tracker, Q2 2025 from the analysis arm of the global mobile industry trade association, GSMA Intelligence, highlighted the current competition in the market, and in addition to uncovering the increased amount of commercialisation found in the three months to the end of May 2025, key events in the sector included Starlink still dominating the industry – but with competition intensifying; Amazon’s Kuiper constellation entering the space race; and enterprise internet of things (IoT) presenting a large opportunity. The report noted that the total number of 109 operators with services was an increase of four players compared with the end of February 2025, and that 27 of these were now live, an increase of two compared with the prior quarter and 82 in testing, two more than previously. Out of a total mobile connections footprint of 5.72 billion, the share of the total connections base covered by satellite and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) was 66%, up two percentage points on February 2025. Yet out of all the activity in the market, the GSMA noted that Amazon’s launch of its first 27 out of 3,200 planned Kuiper constellation satellites represented the biggest competitive development of the second quarter of 2025. At 0.8% of target capacity, the analysis regarded the launch as a “small but significant” step for the tech giant. GSMA Intelligence believes Amazon’s strategic objectives will initially lie in the broadband market – either “not spots” or against higher-priced legacy ISPs in rural areas – and in ubiquitous, global coverage for its logistics operations. Intentions for direct-to-cell (D2C) services were seen as less obvious considering the potential oversupply of capacity and the fact it doesn’t have a clear link to Amazon’s core businesses. The report stressed, though, that Amazon’s D2C ambitions could not be ruled out given the company’s history of entering new business areas. One of the potentially interesting forthcoming battles will be between Kuiper and market leader Starlink, which was top in the market with 7,000 satellites and 10 telco partnerships. However, the study also observed that AST SpaceMobile has secured 30 planned telco relationships and that China’s national satellite efforts and established players like SES, Viasat and Iridium are preparing 2026 direct-to-cell launches, intensifying competitive pressure. The report predicted that Starlink was likely to sustain its first-mover advantage, as AST’s service is unlikely to be widely available until 2026 and Lynk’s coverage does not largely overlap with Starlink. However, GSMA Intelligence stressed this was not a 12-month game. D2C services from MSS providers, notably Viasat, SES and Iridium, are likely to come in 2026, in the S and L bands, and so, said the analyst, commercialisation was likely to play out over a two- to three-year period rather than being won or lost in the near term. GSMA Intelligence suggested bigger questions concern service evolution (SMS to voice to data) and the viability of being able to offer these to a critical mass, considering the spectrum constraints and natural barriers due to the laws of physics. In its previous report for Q1 2025, GSMA Intelligence noted that the IoT was of great interest given that the latest standards (Release 19) in the sector now incorporate new functionality for NTN services geared at IoT applications such as sensors, telematics and energy monitoring. The survey found that 2.5-3.0B IoT devices were now addressable by satellite across logistics, agriculture and utilities. The survey data showed the big opportunity for the sector, with 20% of businesses facing daily critical operations delays from connectivity gaps, with a further 30% reporting weekly issues. Equipment maintenance, supply chain efficiencies and asset tracking are the top three categories of operations where satellite is seen as playing a supporting role. GSMA Intelligence said the study highlighted that there was a window of opportunity to service this demand, and emphasised the need for versatility in satellite connectivity for transient assets.

BNY Mellon has introduced AI-powered workers with company logins that operate autonomously. They handle tasks like coding, payment validation and vulnerability detection without direct oversight. BNY Mellon's first two AI personas were built in three months, with plans to integrate email and Teams accounts. Goldman Sachs has deployed an AI assistant to 10,000 employees, aiming for firmwide rollout by year-end. Tools like Goldman's "GS AI Assistant" proofread documents, translate code, and may soon execute complex tasks. JPMorgan's internal chatbot is used by 230,000 staff, signaling widespread AI integration. Banks debate AI autonomy levels, while Bloomberg predicts 200,000 finance jobs may disappear by 2028 as AI takes over middle-office functions â reshaping traditional employment definitions. AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster. Banks aim to balance human-AI collaboration, but the workforce will look fundamentally different as "bots join payroll."

AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster. Banks aim to balance human-AI collaboration, but the workforce will look fundamentally different as "bots join payroll." The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) has quietly ushered in a new era of workplace automation, deploying "digital employees" powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These digital employees are equipped with their own credentials such as company logins, just like their human counterparts. They also operate autonomouslyÂ âÂ validating transactions, identifying software vulnerabilities and communicating with human managers, all without direct oversight. BNY Chief InformationÂ Officer (CIO) Leigh-Ann Russell said BNY Mellon's initial two AI personas were developed in just three months, and were assigned to specific teams to restrict data access. One was designed to handle coding duties, and the other was assigned to do payment validation. Soon, they will gain email and Microsoft Teams accounts â blurring the line between human and machine collaboration. "This is the next level," Russell told the Wall Street Journal. "In six months, it will become very, very prevalent." Goldman Sachs has similarly rolled out an AI assistant to 10,000 bankers and traders, with plans to expand firmwide by year's end. Dubbed "GS AI Assistant," the tool proofreads documents, translates code and may soon execute multi-step tasks like a seasoned employee. Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti envisions AI evolving to "reason" like a company veteran, generating solutions without explicit instructions. "People are going to be the ones that evolve the AI," he told CNBC, downplaying fears of mass layoffs. Yet, Bloomberg estimates up to 200,000 finance jobs could vanish by 2028 as AI handles middle-office functions. (Related:Â Bill Gates predicts AI will replace humans in most roles within a decade.) How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past.

"In six months, it will become very, very prevalent." Goldman Sachs has similarly rolled out an AI assistant to 10,000 bankers and traders, with plans to expand firmwide by year's end. Dubbed "GS AI Assistant," the tool proofreads documents, translates code and may soon execute multi-step tasks like a seasoned employee. Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti envisions AI evolving to "reason" like a company veteran, generating solutions without explicit instructions. "People are going to be the ones that evolve the AI," he told CNBC, downplaying fears of mass layoffs. Yet, Bloomberg estimates up to 200,000 finance jobs could vanish by 2028 as AI handles middle-office functions. (Related:Â Bill Gates predicts AI will replace humans in most roles within a decade.) How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past. For better or worse, the bots are now on payroll. Watch this clip of humanoid robots taking over manufacturing processes at a factory in China's Shenzhen province.

Title: Microsoft to cut up to 9,000 jobs as it invests in AI
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl0w1w394o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D

Microsoft has confirmed that it will lay off as many as 9,000 workers, in the technology giant's latest wave of job cuts this year. The company said several divisions would be affected without specifying which ones but reports suggest that its Xbox video gaming unit will be hit. Microsoft has set out plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), and is spending $80bn (£68.6bn) in huge data centres to train AI models. A spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: "We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The cuts would equate to 4% of Microsoft's 228,000-strong global workforce. Some video game projects have reportedly been affected by them. According to an internal email seen by The Verge and gaming publication IGN, Microsoft has told gaming staff that the planned reboot of first-person shooter series Perfect Dark, along with another title, Everwild, will be cancelled. The Initiative, a Microsoft-owned studio behind the Perfect Dark reboot, will also be shut down, the memo stated. Job cuts have also affected staff across wider studios owned by Microsoft, including Forza Motorsport maker Turn 10 and Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, according to employee posts on social media seen by the BBC. Matt Firor, studio director of ZeniMax Online Studios, announced on Wednesday he would be leaving his position in July after more than 18 years at the studio. "While I won't be working on the game anymore, I will be cheering you on and adding to the thousands of hours I've already spent in-game," said a post attributed to Mr Firor by ZeniMax on X. Romero Games Ltd, an independent studio based in Galway, Ireland - co-founded by Doom developer John Romero - has also cut staff after funding for its game was axed by its publisher. "These people are the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected," said Mr Romero in a post on X. Microsoft has initiated three other rounds of redundancies so far in 2025, including in May when it said it would cut 6,000 roles. An official database maintained by Washington state shows that more than 800 of the positions eliminated will be concentrated in the city of Redmond as well as in Bellevue, another Microsoft hub in its home state. In recent years, like many other big technology firms, Microsoft has refocussed its business towards developing AI, including investing in data centres and chips. Last year, the company hired British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman to lead its new Microsoft AI division. A top Microsoft executive recently told the BBC that the next half century will "fundamentally be defined by artificial intelligence,", changing the way we work and interact with one another. Microsoft is also a major investor and shareholder in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, although the relationship has reportedly grown tense in recent months. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft has struggled to sell its AI assistant, known as Copilot, to business customers because many office workers prefer ChatGPT. The layoffs among rank and file workers at Microsoft come as major US tech companies court top AI talent. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has been poaching talent from rivals to form a 'superintelligence' lab. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally involved in recruitment. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said recently that members of his team had been getting offers of more than $100m (£74.3m) as "signing bonuses" from Meta. Last month, Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he expected AI would replace some of his firm's workers.

Title: Korean Internet Giant Kakao Teams With Open AI To Jumpstart Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2025/07/02/korean-internet-giant-kakao-teams-with-open-ai-to-jumpstart-growth/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T02:00:56Z
Full Content:
ByJohn Kang ByJohn Kang, Forbes Staff. Shina Chung and Sam Altman are hoping for a win-win. Striding purposefully across the stage at a packed media briefing held in Seoul in early February, Shina Chung, CEO of Korean internet giant Kakao, leaned in to greet OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman. After six months of negotiations, the two companies had just sealed a partnership that would give Kakao (market cap: $20 billion) access to the American AI titan’s powerful technology. As Chung declared on stage, it could potentially turn “all imaginable AI-era services into reality”—and give Kakao a fighting chance to leapfrog the competition. With OpenAI’s help, Kakao hopes to realize its ambitions of being at the forefront of providing hyper-personalized services to the 49 million users of its ubiquitous superapp KakaoTalk, which equals about 94% of the country’s population. Chung is targeting a November rollout of so-called AI agents—next generation virtual assistants that can go beyond answering basic questions to making decisions and even taking actions on behalf of users. Shina Chung, CEO of Kakao “We needed a partner we could trust, especially one who leads the field in performance and innovation,” says Chung in an exclusive interview with Forbes Asia at Kakao’s office in Pangyo, South Korea’s Silicon Valley, just south of Seoul. “We had the same philosophy.” For Kakao and its first woman CEO, the OpenAI alliance could be nothing less than a game-changer. Since taking the top job in March 2024, Chung’s biggest challenge is to steer the company through the longest stretch of sluggish sales in its 15-year history. The 50-year-old Chung, who featured on Forbes Asia’s Power Businesswomen list last year, is betting that going all-in on AI will be a catalyst for growth. “We are now preparing to significantly change KakaoTalk so that AI can penetrate its many services,” she says. The collaboration isn’t a one-way deal. For OpenAI, it offers an opportunity to further its global ambitions by providing access to one of the world’s most tech-savvy markets, which has the highest number of paying subscribers outside the U.S. for ChatGPT, its revolutionary chatbot. “We’re excited to bring advanced AI to Kakao’s millions of users and work together to integrate our technology into services that transform how Kakao’s users communicate and connect,” says OpenAI’s chief product officer Kevin Weil by email. Just the day before the glad-handing event with Chung, Altman was in Tokyo with SoftBank’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, announcing a new joint venture to market AI services to Japanese companies. SoftBank recently led a $40 billion funding round in OpenAI and the two companies are also partners in the $500 billion Stargate project to build AI data centers in the U.S. Jaehyun Kim For Forbes ASIA It’s a critical turning point for Kakao. The company’s business is dependent on the Korean market—compared with blue-chip stalwarts like Samsung and Hyundai whose fortunes are determined by global exports—which faces a deepening economic slump. The country’s GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter amid the threat of a global trade war, weak consumer spending and months of political turmoil. In 2024 the company narrowed its net loss to 161.9 billion won ($119.4 million) from 1.82 trillion won the previous year, on a 4% uptick in revenue to 7.87 trillion won. The alliance with OpenAI could yield as much as double-digit sales growth within two years, according to Kakao as it transforms itself into a company where AI is at the core of its operations and services. Percentages have been rounded. Chung will need to act fast to hard-bake the fast-evolving tech into Kakao’s businesses, which run the gamut of everyday activities, from messaging and online banking to music streaming and taxi-hailing, to gain an edge on its chief rival Naver, South Korea’s biggest internet company by revenue (2024: 10.73 trillion won). The Seongnam-based firm is widely seen as being a step ahead of Kakao in the AI race with its large language model (LLM) HyperClova X, launched in 2023 and tailored for the Korean language and culture. Also closing in is a fast-growing crop of local AI native startups. “The AI agent will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is.” Already Chung has begun laying the foundation. In mid-June, the company announced a 600-billion-won investment to build a 92,000-square-meter AI data center in Namyangju city, about 25 kilometers from Seoul. The data center—its second after last year’s launch of a facility in Ansan with 6 billion gigabytes of data storage capacity—will break ground in 2026 and is slated to open by 2029. By leveraging OpenAI’s LLMs, which undergird ChatGPT, Kakao is developing a suite of services with the aim of getting users to increase their time on the superapp—and spend more money while using it. “We saw diminishing returns trying to compete in the benchmark tests for the most powerful AI models, so we decided on a more practical approach seeking cost efficiency,” says Chung. OpenAI-powered AI agents have the potential to autonomously plan and take action across Kakao’s digital ecosystem, with limited human direction; for example, make a restaurant booking on behalf of a KakaoTalk user, add a calendar reminder, book a taxi and pay for a meal. That stickiness, Chung believes, will result in more ads—one of Kakao’s main revenue drivers—reaching users across its chats and channels. “AI enhances our core business, especially advertising and commerce,” she says. Advertising accounted for 15% of group revenue last year while its commerce unit contributed 11%. Kakao earns commissions of up to 8% per transaction for gifts sent between KakaoTalk users. An average of 600,000 gifts (from chocolate to vitamins to cosmetics and clothes) are exchanged daily, the company says, in the form of mobile vouchers that can be redeemed at participating restaurants and retailers or ordered from the platform’s gift shop. “The advertising business, which currently operates as the main cash cow of internet companies, will undergo dynamic changes with the introduction of AI-based services,” says Jingu Kim, a Seoul-based analyst at Kiwoom Securities. He predicts there will be a rapid uptake in B2C-based subscription plans that include AI agent services. “In this process, we expect that Kakao will be able to secure sustainable growth and level up its corporate value through its collaboration with OpenAI.” A Kakao Friends store selling character merchandise such as Ryan (the lion) and the radish-in-rabbit clothing Muzi. In a dry run with OpenAI’s tech in early May, Kakao launched a new standalone messaging app called Kanana for closed beta testing that features AI agents Kana and Nana. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT and its own small language model (SLM), it can assist users in personal and group chats by answering questions, summarizing group conversations, setting meeting times for events and sharing updates. Kakao declined to say how much it has spent but discloses that some 400 employees, or about 10% of its workforce, are working on AI projects. “For everyday-use cases, we don’t need to [invest in] a large language model,” says Chung, as that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to develop. Besides being cheaper to train and run, SLMs are safer to use as they’re less likely to provide incorrect answers to user queries, known as hallucinations, while also being more secure, she adds. It doesn’t require a network connection to a cloud, which is vulnerable to server breaches. Kakao will use its SLM to perform simple tasks, while relying on OpenAI’s powerful LLM to manage more complex, multistep and linked applications across Kakao’s ecosystem, says Chung. It’s the same strategy used by Apple: simple queries are answered by Siri, powered by Apple’s in-house Apple Intelligence LLM, and more complex questions are directed to ChatGPT. “Everyone was defaulting to GPUs for AI, but does it make sense to use the most expensive chips for small inference tasks?” explains Chung. A taxi operated by Korea Mobility. The company expects to complete Kanana’s closed beta testing in November, around the same time that it plans to launch the OpenAI-Kakao AI agent. “The virtual assistant will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is,” says Chung. “Because now you need to find which app to use, go to the app, take action. With agentic AI it will be seamless.” Alongside her tech focus, Chung has been striving to make Kakao leaner. This has involved shedding non-core businesses—the number of affiliates has dropped by a fifth over the past two years to 115 from 147, the company says. Then there’s the planned spin-off of Daum, the country’s second-largest portal site by daily visitors, which Kakao acquired in 2014. This will allow Chung to concentrate on juicing up other parts of Kakao’s portfolio, both domestic and overseas, and in particular its banking, entertainment and digital healthcare services. In June, a joint venture between its internet banking arm Kakao Bank and Thai financial group SCBX, which controls Siam Commercial Bank, received approval from the Thai government to establish a virtual bank in Thailand, making it the first Korean bank to operate in the country in 25 years. Earlier this year Kakao Entertainment announced the global launch of its fan-community app Berriz as Kakao Healthcare forged a partnership with Seoul-based elderly-care startup Caring and expanded into Japan. Source: Kakao Kakao’s sales started to lose steam after peaking at 2 trillion won in the third quarter of 2023. With the company being under pressure to boost revenue and earnings, founder Kim Beom-su embarked on an aggressive expansion of its entertainment portfolio. Kim, who has a 24% stake in Kakao and a net worth of $5.1 billion, made the fate­ful call to get into a bidding war for K-pop agency SM Entertainment with Korean billionaire Bang Si-hyuk’s Hybe, manager of boy band sensation BTS. While Kakao was ultimately successful, snatching a 35% stake in SM for 1.3 trillion won in March 2023, prosecutors alleged that Kim, long-hailed as an internet pioneer, had manipulated SM’s stock price to ward off Hybe. Kim, who denied any wrongdoing, was arrested in July 2024 and is currently out on bail awaiting trial. In a statement to Kakao employees at the time, he said: “The allegations are not true. I have never instructed or condoned any illegal acts.” A crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” During the takeover battle for SM, Chung was running venture capital arm Kakao Ventures and also had a board seat at Kakao. She had made a name for herself as a VC investor with a portfolio that produced four unicorns. To steady the ship, Kakao’s board enlisted Chung as CEO last year. “I saw that period as a turning point for Kakao,” she recalls, adding that a crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” Chung’s forward-looking approach was honed over a 25-year career that has included roles at Boston Consulting Group, eBay and Kakao rival Naver. Chung studied French literature at Yonsei University in Seoul (not because she particularly liked French lit, she says, but because back then it was the subject du jour among brainy female students), followed by a master’s degree in marketing from the same college and an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. Photo by Jaehyun Kim for Forbes Asia In 2014, she joined Kakao Ventures as a partner, becoming its CEO four years later. Her decade-long stint at the VC arm taught her how to deploy “my imagination with curiosity,” she says. “For example, the market for most early-stage investments wasn’t there yet, so I needed to imagine it.” She did just that with Kakao Ventures’ early backing of South Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions, contributing 2 billion won of the 5.5 billion won in seed funding in 2020. Last December, Rebellions became the country’s first AI chip unicorn, valued at 1.3 trillion won, equivalent to $1 billion at the time, after it merged with a rival chipmaker owned by Korean billionaire Chey Tae-won’s SK Group (Kakao retains a stake). It’s not a given that Chung’s big tech bet will pay off. There are concerns in the industry that AI agents are more hype than substance, and could struggle to gain traction with users, much like Facebook’s metaverse, which saw the social media giant rebrand itself Meta and pour tens of billions of dollars into a virtual world project that has so far flopped. Alongside OpenAI, tech firms Google, Anthropic and Salesforce have debuted AI agents for consumers and businesses but they are nowhere near mainstream. OpenAI is also restricted in its use of personal data collected from Kanana agents, per a government review requested by Kakao over concerns about sharing personal information such as bank account and credit card details. Chat data must be stored in a database controlled by Kakao and can’t be used by OpenAI for commercial purposes, the Personal Information Protection Commission ruled. Kakao Pay is accepted at stores throughout South Korea. For now, a campaign promise by South Korea’s new president Lee Jae-myung to invest 100 trillion won in AI and introduce measures to support the country’s internet giants has led Kakao’s previously moribund shares to surge over 85% in the past two months. Investors also piled in over a proposed law that would allow companies in South Korea to issue won stablecoins, with Kakao’s listed payments platform Kakao Pay seen as one of the main beneficiaries. Kakao Pay shares rocketed before correcting sharply recently after regulators highlighted the risks associated with stablecoins. Chung’s shown the stamina and smarts to meet such challenges and has a secret weapon up her sleeve: imagination. “It will work very well,” she says. “Especially when new eras come.”

Major U.S. equities indexes finished Wednesday mixed as President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Vietnam. Private payroll data released Wednesday morning showed an unexpected decline in employment levels in June, the latest signal of a softening in the labor market that could influence the Federal Reserve as policymakers weigh interest-rate cuts. Investors will get a more comprehensive look at the employment situation with Thursday morning's jobs report. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5%, notching its first all-time closing high of the third quarter and its second record close this week. The Nasdaq was up 0.9%, joining the S&P 500 in record closing territory, while the Dow finished with a small loss of less than 0.1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Centene (CNC) shares plummeted 40%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the company withdrew its full-year guidance. The managed-care provider, which focuses on Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage, cited reports showing a steeper-than-expected growth slowdown in 22 of its 29 marketplaces, while patient illness was significantly higher compared with previous risk-adjustment assessments. Other health insurance stocks also came under pressure: Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Elevance Health (ELV), which also concentrate on government-sponsored plans, tumbled 22% and 12%, respectively. Shares of health insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH) were down 5.7%. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, rose 8.1%, notching the best performance in the S&P 500 and reaching their highest level since a sharp decline hit the stock in April. Although oversupply concerns have pushed prices for the key battery ingredient sharply lower over the past year, lithium prices edged higher on Wednesday. Like other major producers, Albemarle has responded to the challenging price environment with cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions and cutbacks to capital expenditure plans. Coinbase Global (COIN) said it has purchased the token-management platform Liquifi, the latest in a string of acquisitions for the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. Liquifi is designed to help with early stage projects, and Coinbase stressed that the deal will advance its goal of making it easier for organizations to navigate the challenges associated with building on-chain. Coinbase shares added 5.7%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.5% after the biotech firm's experimental flu vaccine based on messenger RNA technology showed promising results in a late-stage clinical trial. The company's head of research and development indicated that Moderna intends to file for approval of its standalone flu shot later this year as well as resubmit its previously withdrawn application for a combination flu and COVID-19 shot. Intel (INTC) shares sank 4.3% following reports that CEO Lip-Bu Tan is evaluating a potential shift in the company's foundry strategy that would involve making a newer generation of chips available to outside customers. The move would require Intel to step away from manufacturing processes that it has invested in significantly over recent years, and semiconductor industry analysts reportedly said the related write-off could amount to billions of dollars. Analysts at Rothschild & Co Redburn downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to "sell" from "neutral," suggesting that generative artificial intelligence tools threaten Adobe's leadership in the market for content creation software. For instance, they wrote, AI tools that can generate images and videos from text prompts represent formidable competition for Adobe's creative products and services. In addition, competitor Figma filed for an initial public offering after regulatory concerns hampered Adobe's acquisition efforts. Adobe shares fell 3.5% on Wednesday.

Title: Something Just Broke: U.S. Employment Tanked In June, 744,308 Job Cuts Have Been Announced So Far This Year, And Retail Layoffs Are Up 255%

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world just happened to the job market? The unexpectedly bad numbers that have just come in have truly been a shock to many of us. Yes, we knew that conditions were getting worse during the early stages of this year. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has publicly admitted that the labor market “deteriorated noticeably” during the first quarter of 2025. But now it is becoming clear that our economic slide is threatening to become an economic avalanche. The U.S. economy needs to add approximately 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. Unfortunately, the latest monthly report from ADP shows that the U.S. economy actually lost jobs last month. Private sector employment dropped by 33,000 in June, and that was the very first decline that we have witnessed since 2023… Private sector hiring shrunk dramatically last month in a worrying sign for the the US economy. Private payrolls shed 33,000 jobs in June, but analysts had expected them to add 100,000, the latest ADP figures revealed. The worrying data – the first decrease since 2023 – suggests the US economy could be a lot less resilient than investors have been hoping. There is no way to spin this to make it look good. The labor market has gotten much tighter, and large companies all over the nation are trimming their payrolls right now. In particular, service jobs are being axed at a very alarming rate… The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000. Financial activity roles also contributed to the month’s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance. Personally, I believe that the numbers that we get from ADP are far more accurate than the highly manipulated numbers that we get from the federal government. But I also believe that the most accurate picture of the labor market comes from the monthly report that is released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. According to the latest report, U.S. employers announced a total of 744,308 job cuts during the first half of this year. The last time that we saw a larger figure was during the early days of the pandemic in 2020… Layoffs across the U.S. this year have climbed to their highest level since the pandemic slammed the economy in 2020, new labor data shows. In the first half of 2025, companies announced 744,308 job cuts nationwide, the highest tally since the first six months of 2020, when employers cut nearly 1.6 million jobs in response to COVID-related disruptions, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2020, we could blame the lockdowns for the layoffs. But this time around, there are no lockdowns. Retailers are being hit particularly hard. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retail job cuts during the first half of 2025 were 255 percent higher than they were during the first half of 2024… Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024. “Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,” Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry.” When I first started using the term “retail apocalypse”, a lot of people thought that I was exaggerating. Does anyone out there want to tell me that I am exaggerating now? Day after day, more big names go bankrupt. In fact, we just learned that Del Monte Foods has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy… Del Monte Foods kicked off efforts to pursue a sale as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US on Tuesday under an agreement with certain key lenders, the company said in a statement. The company has secured $912.5 million in financing to support itself through the proceedings, it said, adding that it intends to remain open and continue operations throughout the bankruptcy. The 139-year old company hosts names like canned fruits and vegetables brand Del Monte, College Inn, under which it sells broth and stocks, and tea brands like Joyba. I had no idea that they were in trouble. Of course even companies that are thriving are making cutbacks right now. On Wednesday, Microsoft confirmed that it will be laying off approximately 9,000 more workers… Microsoft is kicking off its fiscal year by laying off thousands of employees in the largest round of layoffs since 2023, the company confirmed Wednesday. In an ongoing effort to streamline its workforce, Microsoft said as much as 4%, or roughly 9,000, of the company’s employees could be affected by Wednesday’s layoffs. This latest round of layoffs comes in the aftermath of a round of layoffs in May and a round of layoffs in June… Wednesday’s move follows two waves of layoffs in May and June, which saw Microsoft fire more than 6,000 employees, almost 2,300 of whom were based in Washington. During May’s round of layoffs, Microsoft emphasized that it wanted to flatten management layers. But data from Washington state showed only about 17% of the cuts in Redmond were designated as managers. Why is Microsoft doing this? They are supposed to be one of our most successful companies. Speaking of successful tech companies, it is being reported that Amazon will be conducting “brutal workforce cuts”… Amazon’s CEO has announced brutal workforce cuts as the company increases its use of Artificial Intelligence. Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he plans to reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years as AI will make certain roles redundant. Jassy told employees in a note seen by the Wall Street Journal that AI was a once-in-a-lifetime technological advancement and it has already transformed how Amazon operates. If our largest and most valuable companies are ruthlessly slashing workers, what does this say about our economy as a whole? Other corporate giants such as Google, UnitedHealthcare and Nissan are reducing workforce levels by offering buyouts to their employees… In the private sector, Google, UnitedHealthcare and Nissan, among others, have offered buyouts to U.S. workers this year. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. “It’s like lottery winners. Some people think the money lasts longer than it does,” said Donna Walton, wealth strategist at TD Wealth. A couple of years ago, corporate America was engaged in a hiring frenzy. But now the environment has completely changed. We all need to brace ourselves for what is ahead, because it appears that things will get even more challenging during the months to come.

Title: Microsoft: We Need A Lot Less Employees. And a Lot More AI Infrastructure.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts 🚨 Microsoft's 2025 strategy in numbers: ❌ 15,300+ employees laid off (7% of workforce) YTD: •9,000 cuts announced July 2•6,000 cuts in May•300+ cuts in June•Performance cuts in January•and only halfway through year 💰 $80 billion invested in AI infrastructure 40%… pic.twitter.com/LJVfwStpW9 — Jason ✨👾SaaStr.Ai✨ Lemkin (@jasonlk) July 2, 2025 The tech giant’s massive workforce reductions coincide with record-breaking AI investments, signaling a fundamental shift in how Microsoft views its future workforce As the technology giant implements what amounts to its most aggressive workforce reduction campaign since 2014, eliminating approximately 15,300 employees across multiple rounds of cuts in just the first half of 2025 alone — while simultaneously committing $80 billion to AI infrastructure — the company is telegraphing a vision of the future where artificial intelligence increasingly replaces human labor. Microsoft is projecting 14%+ revenue growth this year, with up to 10% fewer employees: Microsoft’s 2025 workforce reductions have been extensive and systematic. The company announced in May that it would lay off about 6,000 people, followed by at least 300 more cuts in June, and most recently announced another 9,000 layoffs in July 2025. Combined with smaller performance-based cuts in January affecting less than 1% of headcount, Microsoft has eliminated approximately 15,300 positions in 2025 alone—representing nearly 7% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. These aren’t random cuts across the organization. In Microsoft’s home state of Washington, software engineering was by far the largest single job category to receive layoff notices, making up more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut in the May round. Microsoft announced its most recent round of cuts on July 2, 2025, affecting about 9,000 employees—less than 4% of its global workforce. This follows the May announcement of 6,000 layoffs, at least 300 additional cuts in June, and smaller performance-based reductions in January. As one person familiar with the matter told CNBC, Microsoft is continuing to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives. The escalating pace of job cuts is particularly striking given Microsoft’s strong financial performance and comes after CEO Satya Nadella revealed that up to 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI, with Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicting that number could hit 95% by 2030. Meanwhile, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion in AI-enabled datacenters around the world during fiscal year 2025 – a significant increase from the $53 billion capex spend Microsoft made in 2023. Microsoft isn’t alone in its workforce reduction strategy. The tech industry’s largest companies have all implemented significant layoffs in 2025, with CEOs increasingly linking these cuts to AI adoption and efficiency gains. Meta: Mark Zuckerberg announced in January that Meta would cut approximately 5% of its workforce—about 3,600 employees—targeting what he called “low performers” to make room for AI investments. In his internal memo, Zuckerberg stated: “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams. I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.” Google/Alphabet: Sundar Pichai announced a 10% reduction in managerial roles as part of Google’s yearlong push for efficiency. Despite this, Pichai has taken a more optimistic stance on AI’s impact, telling Bloomberg: “I expect we will grow from our current engineering base even into next year, because it allows us to do more. AI is an accelerator that will drive new product development, thereby creating demand for more employees.” Amazon: Andy Jassy was the most direct about AI’s impact, telling employees that “we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” as the company adopts more AI tools. Amazon has already laid off more than 27,000 employees since 2022, and Jassy stated: “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The pattern is consistent across Silicon Valley: while revenue and AI investments soar, human workforces are being systematically reduced in favor of automated alternatives. While Microsoft has characterized the layoffs as organizational restructuring to “reduce layers of management”, industry observers see a different pattern emerging. Paul Roetzer of the Marketing AI Institute calls it “quiet AI layoffs”—job cuts that are ostensibly about cost savings or restructuring, but are actually driven by a belief that AI can replace (or reduce the need for) human labor. The evidence supports this interpretation. Relatively fewer sales or marketing positions were affected in the recent layoffs, while technical roles bore the brunt of the cuts. This suggests Microsoft isn’t simply trimming costs—it’s reallocating resources based on where it believes AI can most effectively substitute for human workers. Microsoft has also mandated AI use across its workforce, making it a part of employees’ daily workflow and performance evaluations, further cementing AI’s role in the company’s operations. Microsoft isn’t alone in this transformation. So far in 2025, more than 22,000 workers have been laid off across the tech industry, with many companies citing AI investments as a strategic priority. Meta announced performance-based layoffs of about 5% in January and Salesforce said it would be laying off about 1,000 employees as it redoubles its AI efforts. The pattern is clear: as AI capabilities expand, companies are betting they can maintain or increase productivity with fewer human employees. Analyst Gil Luria told Reuters that with consistent investments of this scale over the next few years, Microsoft may continue to lay off 10,000 workers to “make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures”. Microsoft’s massive infrastructure investment reflects the enormous computational requirements of modern AI systems. More than half of Microsoft’s $80 billion investment will be in the United States, positioning the company to compete in what Microsoft president Brad Smith describes as a “golden opportunity” for American economic competitiveness. Smith described AI as set to become a “world-changing general-purpose technology” and stated that “AI offers not only new tools for people’s work but also new ways to help people learn almost anything”. However, the irony isn’t lost on employees: the same technology promising to enhance human capabilities is simultaneously displacing human workers. The infrastructure investment is also driven by competitive pressures. Having invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, Microsoft provides cloud infrastructure to the startup and has incorporated its models into Windows, Teams and other products. Microsoft’s revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 33% in the fiscal first quarter, with 12 percentage points stemming from AI services. The implications for Microsoft’s workforce—and knowledge workers more broadly—are profound. If AI is increasingly building the software, companies need fewer people to do that job. The fact that coders were hit hardest among Microsoft’s layoffs while customer-facing roles were largely untouched suggests that companies see AI as most immediately capable of replacing technical rather than interpersonal work. This creates a challenging atmosphere where “it is obvious to most that their performance does not guarantee a successful career, despite the company’s earlier announcement of a stringent performance policy”. Employees can no longer assume that strong performance will protect them from AI-driven displacement. Microsoft’s transformation continues with the July 2025 announcement of 9,000 additional layoffs, bringing the year’s total workforce reduction to over 15,000 employees. The company’s announcement came on the second day of Microsoft’s 2026 fiscal year, reflecting a pattern where executives typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year. Microsoft executives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions—growth areas heavily dependent on AI infrastructure rather than human workforce expansion. These moves signal that Microsoft’s workforce reduction isn’t a one-time adjustment but an ongoing transformation representing one of the most aggressive restructuring campaigns in the company’s 50-year history, surpassed only by the elimination of 18,000 employees in 2014 following the Nokia acquisition. For Microsoft, the equation is straightforward: why maintain expensive human capital when AI can perform many of the same functions at scale? As Smith noted, the company sees AI infrastructure as “the essential foundation of AI innovation and use”—a foundation that, increasingly, doesn’t require as many human builders. The message from Redmond is clear: In Microsoft’s vision of the future, there’s room for either extensive human workforces or massive AI infrastructure investments, but not both.

Title: Beyond Nvidia: 5 Lesser-Known AI Stocks Poised For Growth To Buy Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/beyond-nvidia-5-lesser-known-ai-stocks-poised-growth-buy-now/
Time Published: 2025-07-02T20:22:41Z

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia is not the sole beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is the best-known company capitalizing on the generative AI boom that began in 2023, when ChatGPT quickly scaled to over 100 million users. In fact, it was Nvidia’s first-quarter 2023 report, which featured a decline in revenue and forecast huge growth, that made me realize a new technology wave was building akin to the internet boom of the 1990s. Nvidia’s prospects gave me the kick to write a book, Brain Rush, published last year. Since then I have continued to track publicly-traded companies that benefit from growth in demand for generative AI. In my book I mapped out the generative AI value network, including AI chip producers, data center technology makers, cloud services providers, large language model builders, generative AI application developers and AI business consultants. From this network, I created an index of publicly-traded companies in the generative AI ecosystem. Based on the performance of this index, I have identified five lesser-known AI stocks poised for growth. CoreWeave is a New Jersey-based provider of cloud computing services for AI developers and enterprises. Its stock market value has soared 308% since it went public in March. CoreWeave’s stock rise can be attributed to the company’s torrid revenue growth – up 420% in the quarter ending in March, according to a CoreWeave investor letter. Retail investor interest in the company and partnerships with leading AI companies have also contributed to the stock’s performance. Specifically, CoreWeave partners with Nvidia, which Fortune reported invested in CoreWeave before it went public, as well as OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. CoreWeave is on my list because its exceptional growth exceeded my expectations and its stock-price increase leads the pack of Nvidia peers. Prior to the company’s initial public offering, I highlighted key risks – CoreWeave’s dependence on a few large customers, the company’s heavy debt load and the CEO’s lack of experience running a public company. But if the company can keep exceeding high growth expectations, its shares could rise more. Denver-based Palantir Technologies provides software to help public and private-sector clients identify trends, detect fraud and optimize operations through big data analytics. It has enjoyed an 81.3% increase in its stock price in the first half of this year. Palantir achieved rapid growth and high profitability. For example, the company’s revenue increased 39.3% in the first quarter while generating an impressive 24.2% net profit margin, according to a Palantir investor letter. Why is Palantir on a list of AI stocks? Palantir is one of the few companies that have been able to generate substantial revenue growth from the application of generative AI, as I wrote in February. Indeed with the exception of Nvidia, no other company has achieved such significant growth from generative AI-powered products. What’s more, Palantir recently raised its revenue growth forecast for the year from 31% to 36%. In addition to benefiting from government contracts provided by the Trump administration, Palantir stock could be propelled by potential contracts for projects such as the Golden Dome – a U.S. missile shield akin to Israel’s Iron Dome. Citi Research analyst Tyler Radke is not all smiles. Investor's Business Daily reported recently that after meeting with Palantir management, Radke wrote, "We continue to have concerns on how Palantir stock can grow into its valuation, especially if magnitude of positive revisions slow or large contracts (Golden Dome) don't materialize as expected." Snowflake, a Bozeman, Montana-based provider of data analysis services, has enjoyed a 42.1% increase in its share price during the first half of the year. While Snowflake is unprofitable, the company’s revenue grew nearly 26% in the quarter ending in April, CNBC reported. Behind the increase in Snowflake’s stock price are successful initiatives to integrate generative AI into the company’s products, as well as partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, according to CNBC. In addition, Snowflake exceeded investor expectations and raised its growth guidance. Snowflake is growing thanks to its new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, whom I interviewed in May 2024. When Ramaswamy took over as chief executive in February 2024, I was unsure whether he would be as successful as his predecessor, Frank Slootman, who handed over the top job because his successor had a deeper understanding of AI. Since then, Ramaswamy has given Snowflake’s generative AI strategy new life. Indeed, I am including Snowflake on my list because a Snowflake manager told me at a conference in San Francisco in May 2025 that Ramaswamy is doing an excellent job of leading the company’s AI product development. Shares of Meta Platforms, the social media parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, rose 23% in the first half of the year. In the first quarter of 2025, Meta reported 16.1% revenue growth and earned a whopping 39.3% net profit margin, according to Meta’s investor letter. The company has distinguished itself from rivals by using AI to help digital ad buyers sell more. In addition, Meta’s investments in AI-powered products such as Meta AI could become a new growth curve, as I wrote last October. Meta is on my list because the company is betting heavily on AI. Its new “Superintelligence Labs” unit, led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, could create new growth curves for the company, Barron’s reported. However, a note of skepticism is called for because Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bet big in the past – remember the metaverse, which drove the company’s name change from Facebook? That bet has produced billions of dollars worth of losses and does not appear poised to pay off. Nevertheless, Meta could surprise me if the company can attract and motivate the talent needed to surpass more focused rivals like OpenAI and Perplexity. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes the chips Nvidia and others design, have risen 12.3%, increasing steeply, since late April. TSMC grew revenue 41.6% in the first quarter and earned a 43% net profit margin, according to the company’s investor letter. While tariff uncertainty and geopolitical instability could threaten TSMC, a long-standing partnership with Nvidia could propel TSMC stock higher. Analysts project growth in TSMC’s AI-related revenue as high as 45% compounded annually through 2030, according to AInvest. If this prediction is realized, investors could benefit from owning TSMC stock. Bottom Line Nvidia is not the sole beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Other companies who play in the AI ecosystem – CoreWeave, Palantir, Snowflake, Meta Platforms and TSMC – may also enjoy big increases in their stock prices. Investors should consider whether to add them to their portfolios.

Title: Don’t let AI steal your job

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we’re committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it’s hard. That kind of journalism isn’t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It’s okay to hate AI’s encroachment into work. Learn to use it anyway. A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes. ChatGPT’s most advanced models recently served me a surprising statistic: US productivity grew faster in 2024 than in any year since the 1960s. Half that jump can be linked to generative AI tools that most workers hadn’t even heard of two years earlier. The only problem is that it’s not true. The AI made it up. Despite its much-documented fallibility, generative AI has become a huge part of many people’s jobs, including my own. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but a June Gallup poll found that 42 percent of American employees are using AI a few times a year, while 19 percent report deploying it several times a week. The technology is especially popular with white-collar workers. While just 9 percent of manufacturing and front-line workers use AI on a regular basis, 27 percent of white-collar workers do. Even as many people integrate AI into their daily lives, it’s causing mass job anxiety: A February Pew survey found that more than half of US employees worried about their fate at work. Unfortunately, there is no magic trick to keep your job for the foreseeable future, especially if you’re a white-collar worker. Nobody knows what’s going to happen with AI, and leadership at many companies is responding to this uncertainty by firing workers it may or may not need in an AI-forward future. “If AI really is this era’s steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it.” After laying off over 6,000 workers in May and June, Microsoft is laying off 9,000 more workers this month, reportedly so the company can reduce the number of middle managers as it reorganizes itself around AI. In a note on Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that the company would “roll out more generative AI and agents” and reduce its workforce in the next few years. This was all after Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned AI would wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the same timespan, a prediction so grim that Axios coined a new term for AI’s imminent takeover: “a white-collar bloodbath.” This is particularly frustrating because, as my recent encounter with ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate makes clear, the generative AI of today, while useful for a growing number of people, needs humans to work well. So does agentic AI, the next era of this technology that involves AI agents using computers and performing tasks on your behalf rather than simply generating content. For now, AI is augmenting white-collar jobs, not automating them, although your company’s CEO is probably planning for the latter scenario. Maybe one day AI will fulfill its promise of getting rid of grunt work and creating endless abundance, but getting from here to there is a harrowing proposition. “With every other form of innovation, we ended up with more jobs in the end,” Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor and author of the newsletter One Useful Thing, told me. “But living through the Industrial Revolution still kind of sucked, right? There were still anarchists in the street and mass displacement from cities and towns.” We don’t know if the transition to the AI future will be quite as calamitous. What we do know is that just as jobs transformed due to past technological leaps, like the introduction of the personal computer or the internet, your day-to-day at work will change in the months and years to come. If AI really is this era’s steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it. At the same time, becoming an AI whiz will not necessarily save you if your company decides it’s time to go all in on AI and do mass, scattershot layoffs in order to give its shareholders the impression of some efficiency gains. If you’re impacted, that’s just bad luck. Still, having the skills can’t hurt. It’s okay to be scared of AI, but it’s more reasonable to be confused by it. For two years after ChatGPT’s explosive release, I couldn’t quite figure out how a chatbot could make my life better. After some urging from Mollick late last year, I forced myself to start using it for menial chores. Upgrading to more advanced models of ChatGPT and Claude turned these tools into indispensable research partners that I use every day — not just to do my job faster but also better. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.) But when it comes to generative AI tools and the burgeoning class of AI agents, what works for one person might not be helpful to the next. “Workers obviously need to try to ascertain as much as they can — the skills that are most flexible and most useful,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. “They need to be familiar with the technology because it is going to be pervasive.” For most white-collar workers, I recommend Mollick’s 10-hour rule: Spend 10 hours using AI for work and see what you learn. Mollick also recently published an updated guide to the latest AI tools that’s worth reading in full. The big takeaways are that the best of these tools (ChatGPT from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, and Google Gemini) can become tireless assistants with limitless knowledge that can save you hours of labor. You should try different models within the different AI tools, and you should experiment with the voice features, including the ability to use your phone’s camera to share what you’re seeing with the AI. You should also, unfortunately, shell out $20 a month to get access to the most advanced models. In Mollick’s words, “The free versions are demos, not tools.” “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that’s being done repetitively, that’s where the most risk comes in.” You can imagine similar advice coming from your geeky uncle at Thanksgiving circa 1984, when personal computers were on the brink of taking over the world. That was the year roughly the same percentage of white-collar workers were regularly using PCs at work as are using AI today. But the coming AI transition will look different than the PC transition we’ve already lived through. While earlier digital technologies hit frontline workers hardest, “AI excels at supporting or carrying out the highly cognitive, nonroutine tasks that better-educated, better-paid office workers do,” according to a February Brookings report co-authored by Muro. This means AI can do a lot of the tasks that software engineers, architects, lawyers, and journalists do, but it doesn’t mean that AI can do their jobs — a key distinction. This is why you hear more experts talking about AI augmentation rather than AI automation. As a journalist, I can confidently say that AI is great at streamlining my research process, saving me time, and sometimes even stirring up new ideas. AI is terrible at interviewing sources, although that might not always be the case. And clearly, it’s touch-and-go when it comes to writing factually accurate copy, which is kind of a fundamental part of the job. That proposition looks different for other kinds of white-collar work, namely administrative and operational support jobs. A Brookings report last year found that 100 percent of the tasks that bookkeepers and clerks do were likely to be automated. Those of travel agents, tax preparers, and administrative assistants were close to 100 percent. If AI really did make these workers redundant, it would add up to millions of jobs lost. “The thing I’d be most worried about is if my task and job are very similar to each other,” Mollick, the Wharton professor, explained. “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that’s being done repetitively, that’s where the most risk comes in.” It’s hard to AI-proof your job or career altogether given so much uncertainty. We don’t know if companies will take advantage of this transition in ways that produce better products and happier workers or just use it as an excuse to fire people, squandering what some believe is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform work and productivity. It sucks to feel like you have little agency in steering the future toward one outcome or the other. At the risk of sounding like your geeky uncle, I say give AI a try. The worst-case scenario is you spend 10 hours talking to an artificially intelligent chatbot rather than scrolling through Instagram or Reddit. The best-case scenario is you develop a new skill set, one that could very well set you up to do an entirely new kind of job, one that didn’t even exist before the AI era.

Title: Chinese tech firms gaining fast on Silicon Valley in AI race: report

China is fast encroaching on the US’ lead in the artificial intelligence race – raising concerns that Beijing could use the tech for strategic military advancements and the spread of disinformation, according to a report. Multinational banks, public universities and tech firms across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia have started to pivot to language learning models from Chinese firms like DeepSeek, according to a Wall Street Journal report. DeepSeek’s bot triggered a massive stock sell-off in the US earlier this year amid claims that it took less time and a fraction of the cost to develop compared to American counterparts. Global banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered have launched internal testing of the Chinese model, while Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, recently installed the bot in its main data center, according to the Journal. American tech giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google offer DeepSeek to customers – even as the Trump administration has banned the use of the Chinese model on government devices. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still the world’s most popular AI chatbot, with 910 million downloads worldwide compared to DeepSeek’s 125 million, according to researcher Sensor Tower. But Chinese bots are winning over users with much lower prices. And while US firms tend to focus on headline-worthy breakthroughs, China’s models are more consumer-friendly, according to the Journal. “The No. 1 factor that will define whether the U.S. or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said during a Senate hearing last month. “Whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant,” Smith warned. China is already exploring how it could exploit advances in AI for strategic military advances, according to papers published in military journals. If Beijing wins over the majority of users, its bots would serve as a powerful megaphone to cast out information reflecting its own view of the world. And, if China at some point stops cooperating with the US on safety and security measures, its unrestricted artificial intelligence could lead to unprecedented military and societal threats. Chinese firms have already succeeded despite several hurdles, including a harsh clampdown on US chip exports. Those trade roadblocks could also hurt American tech giants like Google, Meta and Nvidia, the latter of which is estimated to lose out on $10 billion in revenue without sales of its H20 AI chip to Beijing, according to researcher Jefferies. It’s a substantial change from just a few years back, when US investors in 2018 covered about 30% of $21.9 billion in funding for the Chinese AI sector, according to PitchBook. Every morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here! OpenAI has been focused on expanding its AI reach across Europe and Asia in order to preserve some industry dominance. “We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in May. China’s lower price tags could pressure US rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic to justify their own prices. “DeepSeek is overall the same quality but 17 times cheaper,” Oleg Zankov, co-founder of Latenode, which helps clients build custom AI tools, told the Journal. Many Chinese bots are also released as open-source models, meaning tweaks can be made, which has made them even more competitive. Developers have created more than 100,000 derivative models based on Alibaba’s flagship open-source model, according to Alibaba. And clients concerned about data security might also prefer open-source models that can be taken offline. Advertisement

Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. READ MORE: More Americans file for unemployment help but layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over tariffs The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. READ MORE: China says U.S. violating tariffs truce with moves on AI chips and student visas Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would’ve faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he’ll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he’d reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it’s close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There’s a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs’ costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. WACTH MORE: What’s ahead for U.S. economy as global market reacts to Trump’s tariffs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.

Title: Intel might axe the 18A process node for foundry customers, essentially leaving TSMC with no rival — Intel reportedly to focus on 14A

TSMC's N2 and A16 may have no rivals When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lip-Bu Tan, the chief executive of Intel, is considering stopping the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication technology (1.8nm-class) to foundry customers, instead shifting the company's efforts to its next-generation 14A manufacturing process (1.4nm-class) in a bid to secure orders from large customers like Apple or Nvidia, reports Reuters. If this shift in focus occurs, it would be the second node in a row that Intel has deprioritized. The proposed adjustment could result in major financial consequences and alter the trajectory of Intel's foundry operations, as it will effectively withdraw the company from the foundry market for several years. Intel informs us that the information is based on market speculation. However, the spokesperson provided some additional insight on the company's roadmap, which we've added further below.“We are not going to comment on market rumors and speculation," an Intel spokesperson said to Tom's Hardware. "As we have said previously, we are committed to strengthening our roadmap, delivering for our customers and improving our financial position for the future." After taking the helm in March, Lip-Bu Tan announced intentions to cut costs in April, which is expected to involve layoffs and the cancellation of certain projects. According to the new report, by June, he began sharing with colleagues that the 18A manufacturing process — a technology designed to showcase Intel's manufacturing prowess — was losing appeal to outside customers, which is why he believed it made sense for the company to shift away from offering 18A and its performance-enhanced 18A-P version to foundry customers. Instead, Lip-Bu Tan proposed directing more resources to the completion and promotion of 14A, the company's next-generation node, which will be ready for risk production in 2027 and for volume production in 2028. Given the timing of 14A, it is now time to start promoting it among potential third-party Intel Foundry clients. Intel's 18A fabrication technology is the company's first node to utilize its 2nd-generation RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, along with a PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN). By contrast, 14A utilizes RibbonFET 2 transistors, PowerDirect BSPDN, which delivers power directly to each transistor's source and drain through specialized contacts, and features Turbo Cells for critical paths. In addition, 18A is Intel's first leading-edge technology that is compatible with third-party design tools and can be used by its foundry customers. Dropping external sales of 18A and 18A-P would require Intel to account for a substantial write-off reflecting the billions it spent developing the manufacturing technologies, according to individuals familiar with internal deliberations cited by Reuters. Depending on how you count development costs, the resulting charge could total hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Both RibbonFET and PowerVia were initially developed for 20A, but that technology was cancelled for internal products last August in a bid to focus on 18A for both internal and external products. Intel's rationale behind the move may be rather simple. By limiting the number of potential customers for 18A, the company may potentially cut its operating costs. The majority of tools required for 20A, 18A, and 14A (except for High-NA EUV equipment) are already in place at its Fab D1D in Oregon, as well as at Fabs 52 and 62 in Arizona. However, once these tools are formally put into operation, the company will have to report their depreciation as a cost. Not putting them online potentially enables Intel to cut its costs amid uncertainties with orders from third-party clients. In addition, by not offering 18A and 18A-P to external customers, Intel may save money on engineers dedicated to supporting the sampling, ramp, and mass production of third-party circuits at Intel fabs. Obviously, this is speculation on our side. However, by ceasing to offer 18A and 18A-P to external clients, Intel will be unable to demonstrate advantages of its fabrication nodes to a broad range of customers with various designs, which would leave them with a single choice for next two or three years: go with TSMC and use N2, N2P, or even A16. Although Samsung is set to formally start making chips on its SF2 (also known as SF3P) node later this year, that node is expected to be behind Intel 18A and TSMC's N2 and A16 in terms of power, performance, and area. Essentially, Intel would not be showing up to its fight against TSMC's N2 and A16, which will certainly not help to gain the confidence of potential clients towards other Intel offerings, namely 14A, 3-T/3-E, Intel/UMC 12nm, and others. Reuters' sources familiar with the matter explained that Lip-Bu Tan had asked Intel's specialists to prepare proposals for discussion with Intel's board this fall. Options could include ceasing efforts to sign up new clients for 18A, though given the scale and complexity of the issue, the decision might not be finalized until the board meets again later this year. Intel itself reportedly declined to discuss hypothetical scenarios but confirmed that the main customer for 18A has always been its own Products division, which plans to begin producing codenamed Panther Lake CPUs for laptops in 2025 using this technology. Eventually, 18A and 18A-P will be adopted by Clearwater Forest, Diamond Rapids, and Jaguar Shores products. Intel's push to attract large-scale external clients to its Intel Foundry fabs remains critical to its turnaround, as only with high volumes the company will be able to pay off for its process technologies that cost billions to develop. However, in addition to Intel itself, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defence have formally confirmed plans to use 18A. While Broadcom and Nvidia are also reportedly testing Intel's latest process technology, they have yet to commit to using it for actual products. Intel's 18A has one key advantage over TSMC's N2: it features backside power delivery, which is particularly useful for power-hungry processors aimed at AI and HPC applications. TSMC's A16 with Super Power Rail (SPR) will only enter mass production in late 2026, so 18A will maintain the advantage of offering backside power delivery for Amazon, Microsoft, and potentially other customers for a while. However, N2 is expected to offer higher transistor density, which is beneficial for the vast majority of chip designs. Furthermore, while Intel has been running Panther Lake silicon at its D1D fab for quarters (so, currently Intel is still in risk production using 18A), the company's high-volume Fab 52 and Fab 62 started to run 18A test silicon this March, so they will start producing commercial chips only late in 2025, or rather in early 2025. Intel's external customers are, of course, interested in producing their designs at high-volume fabs in Arizona rather than at development fabs in Oregon. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly considering halting the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication process to external clients and instead focusing on the next-generation 14A production node, aiming to attract large customers such as Apple and Nvidia. The move could trigger massive write-offs, as Intel has spent billions developing 18A and 18A-P process technologies. Shifting focus to 14A could help cut costs and better prepare the node and operations for third-party clients, but the move risks undermining customer confidence in Intel's foundry capabilities ahead of 14A's planned production in 2027–2028. While the 18A node remains critical for Intel’s own products, such as Panther Lake CPUs, limited demand from third parties — so far, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense have confirmed plans to use it — has raised concerns about its viability. The potential decision — which will essentially withdraw Intel from the broad foundry market until 14A comes to market — will be reviewed by Intel's board later this year. Even if Intel eventually chooses to remove 18A from its foundry offerings, aimed at a broad range of applications and clients, the company will still manufacture chips using 18A for its own products, which are already designed for the process. It also intends to fulfill limited orders it has already committed to, including supplying chips for the aforementioned clients.

Watch CBS News We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. July 2, 2025 / 12:49 PM EDT / CBS News Gold investing has surged in popularity so much in recent years that investors could be forgiven for forgetting that this is traditionally considered an alternative, safe-haven asset. While items like stocks, real estate and bonds can often be relied upon for generating income, gold is typically considered a smart way to diversify your portfolio and hedge against inflation. Without the quick profit-earning potential that those other assets often provide, however, it's understandable that many have yet to turn to gold. But that could be a mistake, particularly now. With the need for a portfolio diversifier high, and both the protection against today's inflation and the next inevitable round pertinent, many would benefit from considering gold now. And physical gold, in the form of gold bars and coins, can be especially valuable for investors this July. Before diving into the gold market, however, it helps to better understand why gold, in this particular form, makes so much sense this month. Below, we'll detail three supporting reasons why it could be worth investing in now. Start protecting your portfolio with a reliable gold investment today. Here are three strong (and timely) reasons why a gold bar and coin investment makes sense this July: Stock market uncertainty earlier this year, combined with unpredictability surrounding the future of the economy, may understandably leave you uncomfortable investing in assets and items that you have little control over. But that's not a concern with gold bars and coins, as they offer you a tangible asset in an unpredictable economy. You can inspect your gold investment with precision, store it in the safety of your own home and otherwise enjoy the benefits that only a tangible asset like gold can offer. The only thing you'll need to monitor? The price of gold. And, fortunately for your investment, that looks to be only heading upward over time. Explore your gold bars and coins options here and get invested now. The days of jotting down a gold investing company phone number from an infomercial are long gone. Gold investing is ubiquitous now and, as such, gold bars and coins specifically are easy to buy, sell and buy more of. Whether you're using a top gold investing company or simply driving over to a big retailer like Costco or Walmart, you should have little issue buying a coin or bar right now. And you can do so online, as well, either on these retailer websites or by perusing the top gold companies doing business right now. The price of gold per ounce is $3,359.04 as of July 2. That's just under the record $3,400 gold hovered near earlier this year. And with predictions of gold hitting the $4,000 mark later in 2025, new investors may be wondering how they can break into the gold market for a reasonable price. Fortunately, physical gold offers this opportunity. By investing in fractional gold bars and coins, which weigh less than the traditional troy ounce, investors can secure the protection gold offers without having to overpay or shift resources from other assets at the same time. This allows investors to earn all of the same benefits that a gold investment in a larger size can provide while still keeping costs low and gold limited to a maximum 10% portfolio threshold. July 2025 could be the time to enter the physical gold market for investors who haven't yet got started. With the ability to offer investors a tangible asset in an uncertain economy, a simplicity in terms of buying and selling and an entry price point that can be tailored to your budget thanks to fractional gold amounts, gold bars and coins have multiple advantages this month. By taking advantage now, you may even be able to sell your gold for a quick profit later this fall, too, making it one of the overall better investment choices this summer.

Title: Microsoft to lay off around 9,000 workers in largest cuts since 2023 | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Microsoft is laying off thousands of employees, its third round of cuts in recent months, the company confirmed on Wednesday. The staff reduction will affect less than 4% of the company’s total workforce, or around 9,000 workers, according to a company spokesperson. It marks the tech giant’s largest layoffs since it cut 10,000 employees in 2023 and comes amid workforce cuts elsewhere in the tech industry. Microsoft’s stock was unchanged following the announcement. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company is reducing managerial layers and making employees more productive with new technologies. The staff reduction also comes as tech companies, including Microsoft, are using artificial intelligence to make their workforce more efficient. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that 20% to 30% of the company’s code was being generated by AI, and the company is pouring billions into AI infrastructure investments. Related article Microsoft to lay off 3% of workforce, report says It’s unclear whether AI directly contributed to Wednesday’s cuts and which Microsoft divisions will be affected. The Verge reported that Xbox leader Phil Spencer sent an internal note saying that his staff would be affected. Bloomberg also previously reported that the planned July layoffs would target the sales and Xbox teams. Wednesday’s cuts come after Microsoft laid off 3% of its staff, roughly 7,000 employees, in May. As of July 2024, the last time Microsoft formally reported its total headcount, the company employed 228,000 workers. Other tech companies have also conducted layoffs this year, including Meta and Bumble. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also warned his staff last month that AI would eventually help the company reduce headcount. Microsoft said in April that its quarterly profits had increased 18% to $25.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, on the back of strong performance for its cloud business and AI services. The company is expected to release earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter later this month. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Shares of Cyngn (CYN) took off Wednesday when the maker of self-driving industrial vehicles announced it raised enough cash in a shelf offering to cover its expenses through 2027. CEO Lior Tal wrote in a letter to shareholders that the company brought in $32 million last week. That's also when Cyngn made headlines by striking a collaboration agreement with Nvidia (NVDA). Tal added that the firm's DriveMod autonomous vehicles are "now operating in warehouse aisles and across factory floors around the clock, delivering measurable improvements to safety, productivity, and labor costs." Tal said that Cyngn machines have been deployed at several new sites across industries in recent months, including manufacturing, automotive, logistics, and consumer-packaged goods. Tal explained that to keep up with demand, Cyngn has moved into a new, larger headquarters office in Mountain View, Calif. Tal noted that the deal with Nvidia to use the chipmaker's Isaac robotics platform "has helped us move faster." Despite today's 12% advance, Cyngn shares are down nearly 90% in 2025. TradingView

Title: Microsoft is conducting another major round of layoffs

Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year. The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. That would be around 9,000 employees based on its head count of around 220,000 employees. Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. One affected employee said they have until July 8 to sign a severance agreement, after which they'll receive 60 days of paid leave. "We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient. A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales "solutions areas." BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes. The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers. Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its "span of control," or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven. It's not just Microsoft. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency. Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers. Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed "low performers."

While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance.

Photo Credit: Reuters Microsoft had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024 Microsoft will lay off nearly 4% of its workforce, the company said on Wednesday, in the latest job cuts as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged $80 billion in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft said on Wednesday it planned to reduce organizational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on Wednesday. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5% of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit, and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across sectors in Corporate America, as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against further cost pressures. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: Arbitrum jumps 5% on Robinhood news – But THIS can ruin ARB’s breakout

Robinhood’s ARB adoption, $2.2M outflows, and a chart breakout—will ARB hit $0.50 next? Arbitrum [ARB] surprised the market with a clean 5% rally at press time, standing out while other major altcoins struggled for direction. The reason? Robinhood’s announcement. AMBCrypto had earlier reported that Robinhood would launch tokenized stocks, ETFs, and equities for EU users using Arbitrum’s Layer 2, alongside future plans to build a custom Orbit-based chain. Naturally, the market interpreted this as a massive ecosystem endorsement—bullish for ARB. At press time, Arbitrum traded around $0.342, notching a 4.88% gain in the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. While it led daily altcoin gainers, trading volume dropped nearly 30%, hinting at light participation behind the move. Despite lower participation from crypto investors, experts and analysts have shown strong interest in the token and appear to be making bold predictions. One expert emphasized that ARB is unlikely to miss its current level again, highlighting the asset’s strong upside potential. Meanwhile, another expert made a bold prediction, stating, “ARB is currently trading at $0.32 and showing strong momentum toward the $1 mark.” These are not the only posts that have surfaced on X; there are several other optimistic posts suggesting strong expert interest in the token and its upside potential. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, the ARB coin has been hovering within a descending channel pattern between the upper and lower boundaries since May 2025. With the recent price jump, the altcoin appeared to be heading toward the upper boundary of the channel. Source: TradingView If this rally holds, ARB could stretch another 7% to retest the channel top near $0.37. Furthermore, if this momentum continues and ARB breaks out of the channel, there is a strong possibility the altcoin could see a price surge of up to 34% in the near future. At press time, ARB was trading above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on a daily time frame, indicating a potential shift in trend and growing bullish momentum in the short term. Supporting this structure is the accumulation data from CoinGlass. In the last 48 hours, ARB saw $2.2 million in Exchange Outflows, including a $2.57 million daily net outflows on the 1st of July. Source: CoinGlass This shift typically signals investor confidence—whales moving coins off exchanges for cold storage or long-term holds.

Title: Intel Just Blinked—And It Could Mean A Breakup Is Coming

ByJim Osman ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. Most investors chase headlines. I follow behavior. Today, Intel said more about the true state of its business—not in a press release, but in a quiet strategic walk-back that most will miss. Is Intel going for a breakup? Reuters reports that Intel’s new CEO is contemplating abandoning efforts to promote its highly anticipated 18A chip technology to external customers, despite having already invested billions in its development and promotion. On the surface, it’s a shift in product focus. But beneath this shift, it reveals a deeper behavioral insight. Intel envisioned its 18A chip node as the breakthrough technology that would spearhead its return to advanced chip manufacturing and secure foundry contracts from hyperscalers such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. Now? Intel is quietly shelving it. Instead, Intel will pivot external customers to its newer 14A process, effectively cutting its losses and leaning into a more focused narrative: fewer bets, better execution. At the same time, the company is shuttering its automotive chip division, laying off staff across its foundry unit, and simplifying decision-making inside the fabs. That’s not cost-cutting. That’s positioning. This action isn’t an isolated move; it’s a pattern. And patterns in corporate behavior often preceded structural change. To the average investor, the move looks like textbook discipline: cut a struggling initiative, refocus on core customers, and redeploy capital more efficiently. But for those of us who study special situations, spinoffs, and corporate behavior, it signals something deeper. This isn’t just strategy, it’s a reset in how Intel thinks. This isn’t just about a product pivot. It’s a behavioral inflection point—and the kind that often comes before structural change. Let’s be clear: Intel hasn’t announced a spinoff. There’s no Form 10, no S-1, and no public timeline to separate the foundry business—yet. But in my experience, corporate breakups don’t start with filings. They start with behavior. And right now, Intel is moving like a company preparing to split. Here’s what I’m watching: Breakup isn’t just about unlocking value. They’re about rebuilding trust. Intel isn’t there yet—but it’s signaling to investors: We’ve heard you. We’re cleaning the house. Stick with us. And for special situation investors, that’s a setup worth tracking closely. Intel remains a complex name. But this foundry pullback offers three critical insights for investors watching through a special situation’s lens: For now, the situation is not a trigger. But in my experience, the best setups don’t come labeled. You need to delve deeper into the details. After nearly two decades studying breakups, restructurings, and hidden value plays, one thing is clear: they rarely start with headlines. They start with quiet decisions, internal shifts, and changes in incentives, not narratives. Intel’s foundry pivot might not spark a re-rating tomorrow. But for investors who track structural change, this is the kind of move that matters. It’s not the event, it’s the signal. Flag it. Log it. Watch it. An Intel breakup may be coming.

Title: The battle for AI talent has been on an entirely different level

Good morning. One group of people may have to pay the price for Elon Musk reigniting his feud with Donald Trump: Tesla investors. The company's stock dropped 5% on Tuesday after Trump highlighted how much assistance Musk has gotten from the US government. Tesla investors will be on tenterhooks again this morning. The EV maker is expected to release its second-quarter vehicle delivery numbers in the coming hours. Wall Street seems braced for disaster. In today's big story, the hiring frenzy of the past few weeks for elite AI talent has been unprecedented, with Meta and OpenAI offering tens of millions of dollars to lure top workers. Plus, take a second and subscribe to BI's Defense Tech, a weekly recap of the latest innovations and strategies in modern warfare, defense tech, and more! What's on deck Markets: Why one PE firm wants to buy Red Hot Chili Peppers' entire catalog. Tech: Senate leaves Big Tech on the cutting room floor. Business: Paramount is paying $16 million to settle Trump's "60 Minutes" lawsuit. But first, need to land a prodigy? Try being prodigal. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Can you imagine getting paid more in a year than you had predicted you would ever make in your entire life? For top AI talent, this has been the reality of recent weeks. "I would describe them as in a state of shock," said Deedy Das, an AI investor at Menlo Ventures. He was talking about three of his friends who are machine-learning engineers or AI researchers — Das said they've all been offered between $8 and $20 million in total compensation a year to join Meta. "It's honestly hard to digest." Tech companies have long paid top dollar for elite talent, but the recent hiring frenzy has been on an entirely different level. And it seems AI talent can't start soon enough. "They're pressuring them to drop out of school," says Bill Aulet, a managing director at MIT. Comparisons have been drawn between the bidding war for AI talent and sports franchises competing for star athletes, with some on X suggesting that researchers hire agents to represent them. The first sign of this new, turbo-charged war for AI talent came when Meta recruited Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang last month as part of a $14.3 billion deal to take a 49% stake in his company. Then, Sam Altman said Meta had tried to poach his best employees with $100 million signing bonuses. (Meta executives recently pushed back, saying that the signing bonuses were not that generous.) This week, BI reported that Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, has paid some talent around half a million dollars in salary for her new startup before even announcing a first funding round or a product. So, what's driving the frenzy? Two factors: A shortage of talent and an excess of money. There is a limited number of researchers and engineers capable of building foundational models — something in the neighborhood of 2,000 people, BI's Bergman writes. Meanwhile, companies like Meta, which is approaching a market capitalization of $2 trillion, have the resources to spare no expense in order to avoid falling behind — and, as we've seen, they're not hesitant to do whatever it takes. 1. The PE giant dreaming of Californication. Bain Capital is in talks to re-enter the music industry and it's teaming up with Warner Music to do so. If it goes through, its first purchase will be the entire Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog for $300 million. Music has proven to be a defensive investment over the years amid economic and market turmoil. 2. Jerome Powell may have just escalated his beef with Trump. The Fed chair said on Tuesday that the president's tariff policy is to blame for the central bank's lack of rate cuts, and it remains in a wait-and-see position until the impact of tariffs becomes clearer. The president has hinted at replacing Powell, and here's what could happen if he follows through. 3. Three investing mistakes to avoid at a market high. Stocks are back near record highs after a tumultuous couple of months, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the second half of 2025. That said, don't fall for these common investing missteps when the market's up. 1. Big Tech has one less reason to like President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." Early Tuesday morning, senators voted 99-1 to strike a section in the bill aimed at preventing states from regulating AI. Tech leaders had argued that it was important not to hamper the AI industry at a time when competition with China is heating up. 2. What's going on between Microsoft and OpenAI? Both companies are currently renegotiating their multibillion-dollar partnership, which gives Microsoft access to OpenAI's technology. Precisely what OpenAI has to share — and when — is sometimes gray, people involved in the matter exclusively told BI's Ashley Stewart, and that's the central issue for Microsoft in these negotiations. 3. Threads finally gained one long-awaited feature. DMs have arrived on Meta's text-based social media network. The change was instituted after it became clear that users were interacting with a different crowd on Threads than on Instagram, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Paramount is paying $16 million to settle Trump's "60 Minutes" lawsuit. The suit, filed in October, alleged that an interview with Trump's presidential rival, Kamala Harris, had been selectively edited to "tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party" during November's election. Paramount emphasized that its statement did not include an apology or a statement of regret. Read more. 2. China's coffee giant is now brewing in America. Luckin Coffee opened two stores in Manhattan, offering a menu full of fruity specialties at extremely discounted prices. BI's reporter wasn't wowed but said it could take a bite out of Starbucks' sales. 3. RIP Bolt's unlimited PTO. The company's CEO Ryan Breslow announced it was eliminating its unlimited PTO policy and offering four mandatory paid weeks off instead. Breslow wrote on LinkedIn that when time off isn't defined "the good ones don't take PTO," and "the bad ones take too much." Tesla reports Q2 production and delivery figures.

Title: Analysis shows Trump's tariffs would cost US employers $82.3 billion

Josh Boak Associated Press Published: July 2, 2025 at 6:26 AM Updated: July 2, 2025 at 11:56 AM Josh Boak Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved FILE - President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, May 23, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. Recommended Videos The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.

July 02, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The drone surveying market is expected to continue to sustain and continue to gain momentum due to increasing demand for aerial intelligence and high-precision mapping across major sectors such as agriculture, mining, construction, and environmental monitoring. A report from Fact.MR analysis indicates that the industry will be valued at USD 1.97 billion in 2025 and will grow to USD 11.49 billion by 2035, at a strong CAGR of 19.3% during the period. The report said: “Technological improvements in LiDAR, thermal imaging, and real-time stream of data over the past three years have dramatically improved safety and efficiency in drone surveying. Drones are increasingly being employed by governments and institutions for commercial use as they are safe, accurate, and cost-effective. Fact.MR believes that support from the authorities, especially in Europe and North America, is fueling commercial usage with better codes in the law. The increasing demand for high-precision geospatial intelligence is one of the key drivers of the adoption of drone surveying. Fact.MR research is of the view that the mining, agriculture, oil & gas, and infrastructure sectors increasingly depend on drones to maximize planning, minimize human risk, and digitize high-resolution terrain information with cost-efficient scalability across vast and inaccessible areas. The enormous digital revolution in the industrial sectors continues to accelerate demand. Combining drones with AI analytics, GIS platforms, and cloud systems enables real-time processing and decision-making. Fact. MR believes that the combination of drone technology with automation and IoT is revolutionizing conventional surveying processes into dynamic data-driven ecosystems.” Active Companies in the markets today include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), Trimble Inc. (NASDAQ: TRMB), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Fact.MR continued: “The drone surveying industry is segmented by survey type into land survey, property survey, rail survey, and infrastructure survey. By end-use industry, it is categorized into energy, construction, transportation & warehouse, agriculture, mining, oil & gas extraction, public administration, and real estate & industrial plant. Regionally, the industry spans North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. IT concluded: “During the period 2025 to 2035, the infrastructure survey will be the most remunerative survey type segment, driven by the worldwide boom in urbanization, smart city programs, and projects for modernizing public infrastructure. Due to this increasing dependence and favorable regulatory changes across UAV use in civil infrastructure, the infrastructure survey segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.6% from 2025 to 2035, ahead of the industry average of 19.3%.” ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Expands Drone as a Service (DaaS) to California with Offer to Acquire an Engineering and Surveying Firm, Tapping into Precision Agriculture and Viticulture Market - ZenaTech, Inc. (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone as a Service (DaaS), and enterprise SaaS, has signed an offer to acquire a California-based civil engineering and land surveying firm with a well established history of operations. This marks ZenaTech’s first proposed transaction in the US West Coast or Southwest region, creating a strategic entry point into California ─ a high-value market for drone-based precision agriculture due to a massive agriculture economy, crop diversity, labor and water challenges, and an openness to innovation. With a commercial, construction and sustainability solution customer base and a deep regional presence, the proposed acquisition positions ZenaTech to scale its Drone as a Service or DaaS survey operations. It also provides significant opportunity to expand into California’s wine and agriculture sectors using advanced drone capabilities including aerial imaging, precision spraying, irrigation analytics, and wildfire detection and monitoring in high-risk areas. “This proposed acquisition is more than just our first Southwest region location — it’s a strategic foothold into a high-value, high-growth state for precision agriculture,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO of ZenaTech. “The firm is a natural fit to help execute our growth strategy for crop health monitoring and precision spraying to serve viticulture, large estates, and commercial farming operations across California.” With the global agricultural drone market projected to reach USD 10.3 billion by 2030, driven by rising demand for precision technologies in farming, California stands out as a key growth region as well as being home to nearly 90% of all US vineyard acreage. Considering California’s mounting climate and agricultural challenges, ZenaTech’s AI-powered autonomous drone solutions offer timely, scalable innovation that serves the needs of commercial enterprises, cooperatives, agriculture consultants, and public sector stakeholders. ZenaTech’s Drone as a Service (DaaS) business model offers both business and government customers reduced costs and convenience to utilize drones to streamline legacy processes and manual tasks such as inspections, surveying, maintenance, precision agriculture and inventory management ─ there is no need to purchase drone hardware and software, find a drone pilot, manage maintenance and operation, or acquire regulatory approvals. The model also offers scalability to use more often or less often based on business needs and utilizes ZenaDrone’s multifunction AI autonomous drones. The company has closed six acquisitions across the US to date as part of its DaaS business model and strategy and has announced it plans to complete approximately 20 more in the next 12 months.

July 02, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Forbes Daily: Tesla’s ‘Soap Opera’ Continues Ahead Of EV Sales Report

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Thanks to TikTok and other social media apps, finding “dupes” of high-end products is easier than ever. Now, Lululemon is taking Costco to court over the issue. The popular athletic wear brand sued the retailer for selling products that allegedly rip off some of its most popular items at a cheaper price point. Dozens of brands have sued over dupes, but it’s not just about proving a product was copied: The creators must show that a copycat product could confuse customers into thinking they’re buying the real thing. Still, many shoppers are intentionally seeking out fake products, one trademark lawyer told Forbes, which makes it much harder to prove brand confusion. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) speaks to reporters off the Senate floor after the Senate passes President Donald Trump's so-called "One, Big, Beautiful Bill," Act at the U.S. Capitol Building. After a marathon negotiation session to convince GOP holdouts, the Senate advanced President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. There are several key additions and omissions from earlier versions, including a softening on credits for wind and solar projects as well as more rural hospital funds. House leadership said it will vote on the Senate version Wednesday. In passing the bill, the Senate approved more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years and changes to federally funded health insurance programs that would leave nearly 12 million people without coverage, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans defending the cuts say they are aimed at reducing abuse, waste and fraud, as most of the Medicaid cuts come via new work requirements for some recipients. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk outside the White House in March. After President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparred again over his signature spending bill, Musk’s net worth plunged by $9.5 billion on the company’s more than 5% stock decline. Tesla shares are down 13% since the end of May, just before Musk and Trump’s public feud began. Musk remains the world’s richest man, but saw the biggest daily loss of any billionaire tracked by Forbes Tuesday. MORE: Tesla is expected to report a major drop in electric vehicle sales today, and Musk’s meltdown over the legislation raises the possibility that the intemperate billionaire is once again courting new risks for his companies, which have received at least $30 billion in federal support since 2010. Typically bullish on Tesla, analyst Dan Ives called it a “soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla’s stock.” EQT, Europe’s largest buyout fund, is shaking up its venture arm amid plans to increase investments in American startups. The $315 billion asset manager promoted investor Carolina Brochado to head up venture and growth investments from a new outpost in New York and announced the departure of four partners. Just months after slashing funding for U.S.-funded international broadcaster Voice of America, President Donald Trump’s media company is testing a global rollout of its streaming platform, raising conflict-of-interest concerns. Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group said the beta test of its streaming platform, Truth+, aims to expand beyond North America. Paramount's settlement will be paid directly to Trump's future presidential library. Paramount says it has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed over a 60 Minutes interview aired last year of former Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump alleged was edited to make the Democratic candidate appear more competent. As part of the settlement, Paramount said that 60 Minutes will release transcripts of all interviews with presidential candidates moving forward. Charlie Riedel/AP File President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—assuming the version Senate Republicans passed on Tuesday becomes law—would cut the legs out from under the renewable energy industry. The biggest hit: The bill would phase out federal tax credits that have for years enabled wind and solar developers to offset 30% or more of project costs. Ironically, these impacts will hit especially hard in Republican areas: 78% of renewable energy projects underway are located in Red districts. Co-CEOs Collin Roche (left) and Dean Mihas (right) are leading the second generation in charge of 45-year-old private equity firm GTCR. While private equity managers hoping for a dealmaking bonanza under President Donald Trump’s administration have been sorely disappointed, GTCR has bucked the trend with a series of gaudy exits. The Chicago-based firm’s $45 billion in assets under management pale in comparison to Wall Street’s biggest players like Blackstone, Apollo and KKR, but none of its peers made off with a deal like GTCR’s and FIS’ sale of Worldpay to Global Payments for $24.25 billion, announced in April and expected to close in the first half of 2026. GTCR bought a 55% stake in the Cincinnati-based payment processing firm from FIS at an $18.5 billion valuation in July 2023, and flipped it in less than two years for double the equity it invested. This comes during a time when the average holding period for the private equity industry crept up to more than six years in 2023 and 2024, a signal that many firms are struggling to find buyers for their businesses. And since the Worldpay deal, GTCR announced two more smaller sales in May, offloading lab equipment firm Antylia Scientific and insurance software business Itel for more than $1 billion each. The flurry of activity means GTCR is expected to return a reported $5 billion in proceeds to investors this year, building on a strong track record for its recent flagship funds. WHY IT MATTERS “It was a slow first half of the year for private equity, but there are always going to be winners and losers on Wall Street, and GTCR is one under-the-radar firm that seized the spotlight,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Its success could make pension funds and endowments hopeful that a rebound is coming for the buyout firms in their portfolios, even while rumors are circulating that some institutions are trying to sell stakes of their private equity investments at discounted prices.” MORE These 7 European And Asian Stocks Are Crushing It And Still Cheap As political divisions in the U.S. continue to grow, a majority of Americans believe politically motivated violence is now a major problem, a new poll shows: 76%: The share of Americans who believe the issues dividing the nation pose a serious threat to democracy, according to the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll 25: The number of attacks and plots targeting elected officials, candidates and other government employees from 2016 to 2025, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies Three times: The number of politically motivated attacks and plots against government agents in just the past five years is three times higher than those in the previous 25 years combined Underperforming the market can cost thousands of dollars of gains in just a few years—so be sure to avoid some of these common mistakes. Don’t try to time the market, and invest consistently each month. Don’t put all of your investments into one stock or sector, and if you do pick individual stocks, take the time to research them. Lastly, build an emergency fund before you start investing so you don’t have to dip into your investments during market downturns.

Title: How large are large language models? (2025)

Instantly share code, notes, and snippets. This aims to be factual information about the size of large language models. None of this document was written by AI. I do not include any information from leaks or rumors. The focus of this document is on base models (the raw text continuation engines, not 'helpful chatbot/assistants'). This is a view from a few years ago to today of one very tiny fraction of the larger LLM story that's happening. *Llama 7B, 13B, 33B, 65B: The 65B model was pretrained on a 1.4T (trillion tokens) dataset. LLaMA was officially stated to use Books3 source as a data set - this is a very important dataset which has been pivotal in lawmaking regarding the training of AIs on large amounts of copyrighted and potentially pirated material. Llama-3.1 405B (2024): The 405B llama model was released. This is a dense transformer model, meaning all parameters are used in inference passes. Initial pretraining: 2.87T tokens, long context: 800B, annealing: 40M - so 3.67T total. source: The Llama 3 Herd of Models. By this point meta has learned to say less about what data goes into the models "We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge" - so I can't say as much about what goes into the training data here. Empirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks The emerging trend of annealing pretrained models to 'benchmax' is unfortunate in that it biases the base language models somewhat away from being pure text continuation engines. This should really be part of the post-training which aims to make the models role play as some kind of AI-chatbot helpful assistant character. But these companies care very much about metrics and scores. For a long time, there weren't really any large language models available to download. There was certainly nothing comparable with GPT-3 for a few years. There were projects to try to match it, but generally they operated by fine tuning things like small (70B) llama models on a bunch of GPT-3 generated texts (synthetic data - which can result in degeneration when AI outputs are fed back into AI training intputs). The release of 405B was a turning point here. Just before that (Dec 2023) Mistral released Mixtral 8x7B - a MoE model, and then in April 2024 Mixtral-8x22B was released - a 141B total, A39B sparse MoE model. Even though this was not a dense model, like GPT-3 (175B) it is comparable in total parameter size. The MoE arch. enabled larger models to be trained and used by more people - people without access to thousands of interconnected GPUs. This was released the day after Christmas 2024. In the words of the deepseek webpage: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base paper. This was a gigantic leap forward in model size, and when R1 (the reasoning model built on top of this base model) was released it impressed a lot of people, I think this may have been the first time a truly GPT-4 level model was available to download and use. For reasons unclear this temporarily tanked the NVDA stock price. This really opened the door to new large MoE language models being trained, especially in China, and released freely for people to use. Note the following models are also starting to be multi-modal, as well as multi-linguial, so they have been provided large amounts of new types of data during training. Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts. DBRX has 16 experts and chooses 4, while Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1 have 8 experts and choose 2. https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/models#repos https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Text-01 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08313 456B A45.9B Attention, Softmax Attention and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Building upon the architecture design and computation optimizations, we train our foundational language model, MiniMax-Text-01 To assess document quality at a granular level, we utilize our previous-generation model as the reward labeler (a MoE model with 5B activations and 60B total parameters). dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-72B after pretrained on high-quality corpus without synthetic data Architecture: Multi-head Attention with QK-Norm in attention Layer, fine-grained MoE utilizing top-6 out of 128 routed experts, plus 2 shared experts. During the training stage, the shared expert remains perpetually active, while only 8 non-shared experts are activated simultaneously. It is not clear to me how many tokens the base model here was trained on but the hf page says "trillions". For a long time there were very very few LLMs on the same scale as GPT-3 that are available. Attempts to match GPT-3 level performance with downloadable weights were hindered by this, and genuinely, I do not think people understood that the raw size of the model being comparable to 175B was required. All that was available were the <=70B llama models and people tried to work with them. 405B is the latest large dense base model available that I'm aware of, but it's annealed and contains recent data in its pretraining (meaning that there will be people discussing LLMs and sharing logs and transcripts of LLMs), so it's a little bit more like an 'assistant' than previous base models. The same flaws apply to the recent wave of MoE models. They also have some aspets of Chinese culture baked into them. It's not completely clear how to compare MoE models with dense models. Perhaps there are aspects of LLM-intelligence that can only be achieved with sufficient depth/density. I don't think the current automated benchmarks are able to capture this, so everyone is just going all in on MoEs now. Newer models might be trained with new architectures (RWKV, byte-latent, bitnet), or new techniques of synthetic data generation (to avoid lawsuits, and to get good scores on benchmarks), but it's unclear how important these things really are for making a good raw text continuation engine - which I believe is the foundation for the capabilities that whatever type of fine-tuning elicits from these neural networks. Currently the trend is to make chatbots that roleplay as 'ai assistants' - and I really hope that more people investigate alternatives. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.
